item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of consumable dental products and related small equipment  and a manufacturer and distributor of products for use in infection prevention in both the medical and dental markets 
prior to december   we were a wholly owned subsidiary of sybron international corporation  which is now known as apogent technologies inc on december   sybron international spun off its dental business by way of a pro rata distribution to its shareholders of all of our outstanding common stock together with related preferred stock purchase rights 
as a result of the spin off  we became an independent  publicly traded company 
on october   we consolidated our infection prevention business segment into our professional dental business segment to reduce costs and coordinate marketing efforts for our infection prevention products thereby reducing the number of our business segments from three to two 
our two business segments are named professional dental and orthodontics 
in addition to re aligning our business segments  at the commencement of the fiscal year we transferred the net sales of our stainless steel endodontic product line from the professional dental segment to the orthodontics segment 
while the costs for the sales and marketing of those products were handled during fiscal year by the orthodontics segment  the net sales were reported in our professional dental business segment 
as a result of this transfer  the operating results of the professional dental segment for fiscal year reflects the decrease of the sales of the endodontic product line from the prior year fiscal period  while the operating results of the orthodontic segment reflects the increase in net sales in fiscal year from the prior year fiscal period 
while the transfer impacted the respective results of operations we reported for the professional dental and orthodontics segments for fiscal  there was no impact on our reported consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year 
all financial information presented in this annual report combines the historical information of the infection prevention and professional dental business segments into the professional dental reporting segment 
we did not adjust the prior period information reported for our professional dental and orthodontics segments to reflect the transfer of the endodontic product line 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in item of this annual report 
results of operations overview net sales in and increased by and  respectively  from the corresponding prior year period 
included in the increase in net sales for the year ended september  is internal growth of  a favorable foreign currency translation of  with the remaining sales increase predominately attributed to acquisitions 
included in the net sales increase for the year ended september  was a increase related to acquisitions  and a increase due to favorable foreign currency fluctuations 
the increase was partially offset by a negative internal growth in fiscal our domestic sales for the fiscal year ended september  were million  representing an increase of million or over the comparable prior year period 
international sales increased by million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to the same period in the prior year 
foreign currency fluctuations in the year ended september  represented million of the increase in international sales over the comparable prior year period 
we believe that our increase in revenue is a result  in part  of the changes we made throughout our organization in the second half of fiscal  the introduction of our new led curing light  the increase in our endodontic sales force and the increased average tenure of the sales force in the united states of our orthodontics segment 
we expect to see continued revenue growth in fiscal  although we anticipate the revenue related to sales of our new led curing light will decrease and we anticipate the weakening economy in latin america and asia  as well as reductions to regulatory health reimbursement programs in germany  to have a somewhat negative impact on the orthodontic segment sales for fiscal additionally  we expect to see continued pricing pressures in a competitive environment 
lastly  we are continuing to incur expenses in association with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  both in terms of one time costs as well as ongoing expenses

critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and are inherently uncertain 
as a result  changes in estimates  assumptions and general market conditions on which our judgments and estimates are based  could cause actual results to differ materially from future expected results 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we estimate customer demand  prices for products and future inventory usage in evaluating the adequacy of inventory reserves 
increases in inventory reserves are charged to cost of goods sold 
intangible and long lived assets our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  market conditions and other factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
pension and other postretirement benefits we have two non contributory defined benefit pension plans that cover all regular united states based employees with more than five years of service 
our accumulated benefit obligation  the fair value of plan assets and the amount of annual pension cost are calculated based on a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected long term return on plan assets  assumed rates of compensation increase and the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations to be paid in the future 
in developing these assumptions  we evaluate input from our actuaries as well as information available from the securities markets 
the assumptions and factors used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market conditions  earlier or later retirement ages or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension obligation or expense recorded by us 
the actuarial assumptions are evaluated annually as of the beginning of each fiscal year 
at october   the discount rate was 
to the extent the discount rate increases or decreases  the projected pension obligation is decreased or increased  accordingly 
the estimated effect of a percent decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected pension obligation by million and increase annual pension expense by million 
the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets is the weighted average rate of the long term investment return expected on those assets 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  the gain would reduce future pension expense over a period of approximately to years 
as of october   we utilized as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the assumed average rate of compensation increase is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees 
at october   we utilized a rate of percent 
this rate is utilized principally in calculating the pension obligation and annual pension expense 
the estimated effect of a percent increase in the assumed rate of compensation increase would increase the projected pension obligation by million and increase annual pension expense by million 
based on market conditions  and based on information from our actuaries and investment advisors  we reduced  during the quarter ended june   our discount rate from to and the expected return on plan assets from to 
we maintained our expected rate of compensation increase at 
to compensate for the lowered assumptions  we made a million contribution to our pension fund during the quarter ended june  the change in assumptions will result in an increase in our pension expense in fiscal acquisitions as discussed in item business research and development  we have maintained an active program of development and introduction of new products 
we believe that introducing new products is important to maintain our competitive position 
we have also pursued numerous acquisition opportunities  completing acquisitions between and acquisitions completed since the beginning of fiscal are as follows acquisition company date description spofadental a 
s manufacturer of consumable dental supplies surgical acuity  inc manufacturer of magnification lenses and fiber optic lighting systems used for illumination during dental procedures these acquisitions included in our professional dental segment are consistent with our strategy of acquiring product lines that can be manufactured in existing facilities  sold through existing sales and distribution networks or that expand our geographic reach 
we intend to continue to seek out acquisition candidates consistent with our strategy 
however  there can be no assurance of the number or size of future acquisitions 
restructuring charges in september  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million million after tax

international operations a substantial portion of our sales  income and cash flows is derived internationally 
the financial position and the results of operations from substantially all of our international operations  other than most us export sales  are measured using the local currency of the countries in which such operations are conducted and are then translated into us dollars 
while the reported income of foreign subsidiaries will be impacted by a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to a particular local currency  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are mitigated by the fact that our subsidiaries operations are conducted in numerous foreign countries and  therefore  in numerous foreign currencies 
in addition  our us export sales may be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the value of the us dollar  as foreign customers may adjust their level of purchases upward or downward according to the weakness or strength of their respective currencies versus the us dollar 
from time to time we employ currency hedges to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
in january  march  april  and may  we hedged our foreign currency exposure to protect against currency fluctuations in fiscal by securing monthly zero cost collar contracts with a notional amount of approximately million for the euro and a notional amount of approximately million for the japanese yen 
no currency gain or loss on currency hedges was recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended september  however  a currency loss of million net of income tax  representing the fair value of the zero cost collars  was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
additionally  in june  we entered into cross currency debt swap transactions to hedge our net investment in hawe neos and sybron dental specialties japan 
the agreements were contracts to exchange a us dollar principal amount of million in exchange for a swiss franc principal amount of million at the termination date of june  and a us dollar principal amount of million in exchange for a japanese yen principal amount of million at the termination date of june  for fiscal year  the fair value of the cross currency debt swap transaction loss net of income tax included in the cumulative translation adjustments was million 
for additional information regarding foreign currency risk management please refer to item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in june  july  and november  we hedged our foreign currency exposure to protect against currency fluctuations in fiscal by securing monthly zero cost collar contracts with a notional amount of approximately million for the euro and a notional amount of approximately million for the japanese yen 
no currency gain or loss was recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended september we expect to continue to employ measures to protect our earnings from currency volatility through the use of currency options  forward contracts or similar instruments beyond fiscal year the following table sets forth our domestic sales and sales outside the united states in  and see also note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
year ended september  in thousands domestic net sales international net sales total net sales inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on net sales or income during any of the periods presented above 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
liquidity and capital resources general we intend to fund our working capital requirements primarily related to inventory and accounts receivable  capital expenditure requirements primarily related to the purchase of machinery equipment  acquisitions  principal and interest payments on our credit facility defined below  obligations under the sale leaseback defined below  restructuring expenditures  other liabilities and periodic expansion of facilities  to the extent available  with funds provided by operations and short term borrowings under the revolver defined below 
while cash provided from operating activities may be impacted by a variety of factors  such as lower revenues  an increase in expenses  and the continued risk of a competitive market and changes in demand for our products  we believe that our cash flow from operations  unused amounts available under our revolver defined below and access to capital markets will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital investment  acquisition and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that will be the case 
to the extent that funds are not available from these sources  we would have to raise additional capital in another manner 
it is currently our intent to reduce total debt and to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy when those acquisitions appear to be in the best interest of the stockholders  taking into account our level of debt and interest expense 
if significant acquisition opportunities become available  of which there can be no assurance  we may require financing beyond the capacity of our credit facility defined below 
in addition  certain acquisitions previously completed contain earnout provisions requiring further payments in the future if certain financial results are achieved by the acquired companies 
the statements contained in the immediately preceding paragraph concerning our intent to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy are forward looking statements 
our ability to continue our acquisition strategy is subject to a number of uncertainties  including  but not limited to  our ability to raise capital beyond the capacity of our credit facility and the availability of suitable acquisitions candidates at reasonable prices 
year ended september  working capital decreased from million at september  to at september  the current ratio decreased from at september  to at september  the current ratio decreased as a result of increases in accrued payroll as well as employee benefits and income taxes payable  both of which were the result of the improved performance in fiscal as compared to fiscal during the same period cash increased from million to million  primarily due to million provided by operating activities and million of other cash inflows  offset by million of cash used for acquisitions  million of capital expenditures  and million of net debt reduction 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  an increase of million 
the primary causes of the increase in cash provided by operations were the increases in net income of million million of which was the result of ceasing goodwill amortization  income taxes payable of million and accrued payroll and employee benefits of million  as well as a decrease in inventory of million 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
accounts receivable increased by million from september  to september   consistent with the increase in sales from the fourth fiscal quarter of to the fourth fiscal quarter of days sales outstanding increased slightly  from at september   to at september  inventory decreased million from september  to september  as a result of our increased focus on supply chain and inventory management 
inventory turns increased to at september  from at september  credit facilities and senior subordinated notes on june   we terminated our then existing million credit facility and entered into a million syndicated credit facility for which credit suisse first boston is the administrative agent 
the credit facility the credit facility  provides for a five year million revolving credit facility the revolver  a seven year million term loan the term loan b and a five year million revolving credit facility the euro tranche 
sybron dental specialties  inc  kerr corporation  ormco corporation and pinnacle products  inc the domestic borrowers are joint and several borrowers under the revolver and the term loan b  and hawe neos holdings sa hawe neos is the borrower under the euro tranche 
sybron dental specialties became a borrower under the revolver and term loan b as a result of the merger of sybron dental management into sybron dental specialties effective january  in addition to the credit facility  we also completed on june   the sale of million of senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes in a private offering 
we used the proceeds of the term loan b  together with proceeds from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes  to repay all of the million of borrowings outstanding as of june  under our previous credit facility 
the credit facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by sybron dental specialties  inc  the other domestic borrowers and each of our present and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  and is secured by substantially all assets of each such entity  including the capital stock of each domestic subsidiary 
in addition  the credit facility is secured by a pledge of of the capital stock of each of our first tier material foreign subsidiaries 
the euro tranche is also guaranteed by certain foreign subsidiaries and is secured by a pledge of of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries and by some of the assets of our swiss subsidiary  hawe neos  certain direct subsidiaries of hawe neos and certain of our other indirect foreign subsidiaries 
the credit facility may be prepaid at any time without penalty except for libor and euro libor breakage costs 
under the credit facility  subject to certain exceptions  we are required to apply all of the proceeds from any issuance of debt  half of the proceeds from any issuance of equity  half of our excess annual cash flow and  subject to permitted reinvestments  all amounts received in connection with any sale of our assets and casualty insurance and condemnation or eminent domain proceedings  in each case to repay the outstanding amounts under the facility 
the term b loan amortizes annually for the first six years  payable quarterly  with the balance to be paid in the seventh year in equal quarterly installments 
the term b loan bears interest  at our option  at either a the libor rate  plus between and basis points  or b the base rate  plus between and basis points  in each case as determined according to the rating of the credit facility by standard and poor s and moody s 
the per annum initial interest rate until the delivery of the pricing certificate for the fiscal quarter ending december  was libor  plus basis points 
the per annum interest rate ending september  was libor  plus basis points 
as of september   the amount outstanding on the term b loan was million 
the average interest rate at september  on the term b loan was after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements we had in effect as of that date 
the revolver bears interest  at our option  at a per annum rate equal to either a the libor rate  plus between and basis points  or b the base rate  plus between and basis points  in each case as determined on a quarterly basis according to a leveraged based pricing grid with leverage ratios from x to x 
the per annum initial interest rate until the delivery of the first pricing certificate for the fiscal quarter ending december  was libor  plus basis points 
the per annum interest rate ending september  was libor  plus basis points 
the annual commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolver will vary between to based on the quarterly leverage ratio 
as of september   there was no outstanding balance on the revolver and the amount available was million 
the revolver also provides for the issuance of standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit as required in the ordinary course of business 
as of september   a total of million in letters of credit was issued 
the euro tranche bears interest  at our option  at euro libor or at base rate with margins identical to those of the revolver 
the annual commitment fee on the unused portion of the euro tranche varies between to based on the quarterly leverage ratio 
as of september   there was no outstanding balance under the euro tranche and the amount available was million 
the credit facility contains certain covenants  including  without limitation  restrictions on i debt and liens  ii the sale of assets  iii mergers  acquisitions and other business combinations  iv transactions with affiliates  v capital expenditures  vi restricted payments  including repurchase or redemptions of the notes  vii the repurchase or redemption of more than million of our stock from stockholders and viii loans and investments  as well as prohibitions on the payment of cash dividends 
the credit facility also has certain financial covenants  including  without limitation  maximum leverage ratios  minimum fixed charge coverage ratios  minimum net worth and maximum capital expenditures 
our ability to meet our debt service requirements and to comply with such covenants is dependent upon our future performance  which is subject to financial  economic  competitive and other factors affecting us  many of which are beyond our control 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at september  in connection with entering into our credit facility on june   we issued million of senior subordinated notes bearing interest at  maturing on june  the senior subordinated notes are our unsecured obligations  subordinated in right of payment to all our existing and future senior debt in accordance with the subordination provisions of the indenture 
prior to january   sybron dental management  inc sdm was a guarantor subsidiary of sybron dental specialties  inc sds for our senior subordinated notes 
effective january   sdm was merged into sds 
the senior subordinated notes are generally not redeemable at our option before june  some limited redemption is allowed if we receive cash from an equity offering 
at any time  and from time to time on or after june   we may redeem the senior subordinated notes  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
twelve month period commencing june  percentage and thereafter as a result of the terms of our credit facility  we are sensitive to a rise in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates would result in increased interest expense on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates 
in order to reduce our sensitivity to interest rate increases  from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
as of september   we had two interest rate swap agreements outstanding aggregating a notional amount of approximately million 
on february   we assigned an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million and incorporated the fair value to an existing amended interest rate swap agreement 
under the terms of the swap agreements  we are required to pay fixed rate amounts equal to the swap agreement rates listed below 
in exchange for the payment of the fixed rate amounts  we receive floating rate amounts equal to the three month libor rate in effect on the date of the swap agreements and the subsequent reset dates 
for each of the swap agreements  the rate resets on the quarterly anniversary of the swap agreement s effective date until the agreement s expiration date 
the net interest rate paid by us on the indicated notional amount is approximately equal to the sum of the relevant swap agreement rate plus the applicable eurodollar rate margin 
the rates and durations as of september  are as follows expiration date notional amount swap agreement date swap agreement rate swap effective date march  million january  march  june  million january  march  sale leaseback in  we completed the sale and leaseback the sale leaseback of our then principal domestic manufacturing and office facilities with an unaffiliated third party 
the transaction has been accounted for as a financing for financial statement purposes  thus the facilities remain in property  plant and equipment 
the transaction was treated as a sale for income tax purposes 
the financing obligation is being amortized over the initial year lease term 
the initial term of each lease is years with five five year renewal options 
on the fifth anniversary of the leases and every five years thereafter including renewal terms  the rent is increased by the percentage equal to of the percentage increase in the consumer price index over the preceding five years 
the percentage increase to the rent in any five year period is capped at 
beginning january   the annual rent payments increased to million 
the next adjustment will occur january  as a result of the spin off  the sale leaseback was amended to extend the leases an additional years  increase the basic rent by million per year  and provides us the option to purchase the leased premises at fair market value from june  to may  we pay all costs of maintenance and repair  insurance  taxes and all other expenses associated with the properties 
we have the option to purchase the facilities according to the terms of any bona fide offer received by the lessor from a third party at any time during the term of the leases 
we may be obligated to repurchase the property upon the event of a breach of certain covenants or occurrence of certain other events

for a more complete description of our credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes  please see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
cautionary factors this report contains  and other disclosures that we make from time to time may contain  forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of words such as anticipate  believe  continue  estimate  expect  goal  objective  outlook  could  intend  may  might  plan  potential  predict  should  or will or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology signify forward looking statements 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future results of operations or our financial conditions  or state other forward looking information 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward looking statements 
although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results 
in addition to the assumptions and other factors referenced specifically in connection with such statements  the following factors could impact our business and financial prospects and affect our future results of operations and financial condition we are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends  interest income and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations 
we are a united states holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries  some of which are located in other countries 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will therefore be dependent on receipt of dividends  interest income and loans from our direct and indirect subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries may be limited in the amounts they are permitted to pay as dividends to us on their capital stock as a result of statutory and other contractual restrictions 
in particular  there are significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of non us subsidiaries to remit money to us 
as a result  some or all of our subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends to us 
if they do not  we may not be able to make debt service payments on our debt instruments 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively 
numerous competitors participate in our business segments  some of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
our principal competitors in the professional dental business segment include dentsply international inc  m corporation and its affiliate espe gmbh co  ivoclar vivadent group  johnson johnson  steris corporation  and ecolab  inc  and in the orthodontics business segment  our principal competitors include unitek  a subsidiary of m corporation  gac orthodontics  a subsidiary of dentsply  and american orthodontics 
some of the companies have a larger sales force and invest more heavily in research  product development and product marketing than we do 
as a result  we may not be able to achieve or maintain adequate market share or margins  or compete effectively  against these companies 
we rely heavily on manufacturing operations to produce the products we sell  and we could be injured by disruptions of our manufacturing operations 
we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce most of the products we sell 
while we do not presently anticipate any significant disruption of those operations  should a disruption occur  for any reason  such as strikes  labor disputes  or other labor unrest  power interruptions  fire  war  or other force majuere  could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business 
in particular  we rely upon our facilities in mexico to manufacture a substantial portion of our orthodontic products 
any disruption in our ability to import those products into the united states could severely impact our orthodontics sales 
although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers  our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices 
our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we presently have  and will continue to have  a substantial amount of indebtedness which require significant interest payments 
as of september   we had million in total long term borrowings including current portion  and million in stockholders equity 
in addition  subject to restrictions in the indenture for our senior subordinated notes and our credit facility  we may incur additional indebtedness 
our substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences  which include the following our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  or general corporate purposes may be impaired  we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service on our senior subordinated notes and other indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes such as potential acquisitions and capital expenditures  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates  to the extent our borrowings bear variable rates of interest  including through interest rate swap agreements  we have a higher level of indebtedness than some of our competitors  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing conditions in our industry  including increased competition  and we are more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
from time to time we have engaged in interest rate hedges to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
if we are unable to  or elect not to employ interest rate hedges  it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
in addition  our credit facility contains numerous restrictive operating and financial covenants  which could limit our operating flexibility 
our ability to pay or refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  and other factors beyond our control 
increases in interest rates would adversely affect our cash flows and therefore our results of operations 
in addition  the terms of any additional debt or equity financing that we may incur could restrict our operational flexibility and prevent us from pursuing business opportunities of value to our stockholders 
we may incur impairment charges on our intangible assets with indefinite lives that would reduce our earnings 
on october   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life be tested at least annually for impairment 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives must also be tested for impairment between the annual test if an event occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount 
as of september   goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives represented approximately of our total assets 
if during the testing an impairment is determined  our financial results for the relevant period will be reduced by the amount of the impairment  net of income tax effects  if any 
future exchange rate fluctuations or inflation may adversely affect our results of operations 
we manufacture many of our products  including those in our professional dental business segment  in our facilities in mexico  canada  switzerland  czech republic and italy 
these products are supported by our sales offices in europe  japan  australia  czech republic  south america and mexico 
in fiscal  our foreign facilities selling  general and administrative expenses represented approximately of our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses while our foreign sales represented approximately of our total net sales 
we measure our financial position and results of operations from substantially all of our international operations  other than most us export sales  using local currency of the countries in which we conduct such operations and then translate them into us dollars 
the reported income of our foreign subsidiaries will be impacted by a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to a particular local currency 
our us export sales may also be affected by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the value of the us dollar as foreign customers may adjust their level of purchases according to the weakness or strength of their respective currencies versus the us dollar 
in addition  any future increases in the inflation rate in any country where we have operations may negatively affect our results of operations 
to the extent these local currencies depreciate against the us dollar  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we have engaged in currency hedges to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
if we are unable to  or elect not to continue to employ currency hedges  it could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability 
as we expand our international presence  these risks may increase 
acquisitions have been and continue to be an important part of our growth strategy  failure to consummate strategic acquisitions could limit our growth and failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely impact our results 
our business strategy includes continued growth through strategic acquisitions  which depends upon the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices and our ability to quickly resolve transitional challenges 
failure to consummate appropriate acquisitions would adversely impact our growth and failure to successfully integrate them would adversely affect our results 
these challenges include integration of product lines  sales forces and manufacturing facilities and decisions regarding divestitures  cost reductions  and realizing other synergies 
also  these challenges involve risks of employee turnover  disruption in product cycles and the loss of sales momentum 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully manage them in the future 
also  our credit facility and the indenture for the senior subordinated notes limit our ability to consummate acquisitions by imposing various conditions which must be satisfied 
our profitability may be affected by factors outside our control 
our ability to increase sales  and to profitably distribute and sell our products  is subject to a number of risks  including changes in our business relationships with our principal distributors  competitive risks such as the entrance of additional competitors into our markets  pricing and technological competition  risks associated with the development and marketing of new products in order to remain competitive and risks associated with changes in demand for dental services which can be affected by economic conditions  health care reform  government regulation  and more stringent limits on expenditures by dental insurance providers or governmental programs 
we strive to increase our margins by controlling our costs and by improving our manufacturing efficiencies 
there can be no assurance  however  that our efforts will continue to be successful 
margins can be affected by many factors  including competition  product mix  and the effect of acquisitions 
if we are unable to successfully manage growth and retain qualified personnel  we may not be able to compete effectively and our revenues may drop significantly 
we intend to continue to expand our business over time into new geographic regions and additional products and services  subject to the sufficiency of our cash resources and our ability to comply with the covenants in our various debt instruments 
our future performance will depend  in large part  upon our ability to implement and manage our growth effectively 
our growth in the future will continue to place a significant strain on our administrative  operational  and financial resources 
we anticipate that  if we are successful in expanding our business  we will be required to recruit and hire a substantial number of new managerial  finance  accounting  and support personnel 
failure to retain and attract additional management personnel who can manage our growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on our performance 
to manage our growth successfully  we will also have to continue to improve and upgrade operational  financial and accounting systems  controls and infrastructure as well as expand  train and manage our employees 
our failure to manage the future expansion of our business could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
our ability to hire and retain competent employees is also subject to a number of risks  including unionization of our non union employees and changes in relationships with our unionized employees 
in particular  many of our non management employees in europe are subject to national labor contracts  which are negotiated from time to time at the national level between the national labor union and the employees council 
there is a risk of strikes or other labor disputes at our locations which are unionized or are subject to national contracts which could affect our operations 
we rely heavily upon key distributors  and we could lose sales if any of them stop doing business with us 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales were made through our top five independent distributors 
mergers and consolidation of our distributors have temporarily slowed sales of our products in the past and may do so in the future 
we believe that the loss of either one of our top two distributors  the only distributors who account for more than of our consolidated net sales and who sell primarily into the dental segment  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition until we find alternative means to distribute our products 
we are subject to product liability litigation and related risks which could adversely affect our business 
because many of our products are designed for use in and around a patient s mouth  and because many of these products contain chemicals  metals  and other materials  we are subject to claims and litigation brought by patients or dental professionals alleging harm caused by the use of or exposure to our products 
we may need to devote substantial amounts of time and attention to defending ourselves and may also be required to pay large amounts in settlement or upon judgment 
we may also be required to or may voluntarily recall products  which would require substantial effort and cost 
litigation or a product recall could divert significant amounts of our management s time from other important matters 
our business could also be adversely affected by public perceptions about the safety of our products  whether or not any such concerns are justified 
our business is subject to quarterly variations in operating results due to factors outside of our control 
our business is subject to quarterly variations in operating results caused by a number of factors  including business and industry conditions  the timing of acquisitions  distribution chain issues  and other factors beyond our control 
all these factors make it difficult to predict operating results for any particular period 
we may be subject to risks arising from other business and investment considerations that may be disclosed from time to time in our securities and exchange commission filings or in other publicly written documents 
changes in international trade laws and in the business  political and regulatory environment abroad could materially adversely affect our business 
our foreign operations include manufacturing facilities in canada  switzerland  italy and mexico 
accordingly  an event that has a material adverse impact on our foreign operations may materially adversely affect our operations as a whole 
the business  regulatory and political environments in countries where we have operations differ from those in the united states and our foreign operations are exposed to a number of inherent risks  including  but not limited to changes in international trade laws  such as the north american free trade agreement  or nafta  affecting our activities in mexico and canada  changes in local labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain local employees  currency exchange restrictions and fluctuations in the value of foreign currency  potentially adverse tax consequences  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  political conditions in countries where we have operations  unexpected changes in the regulatory environment  and changes in general economic conditions in countries  such as italy and mexico  that have historically been less stable than the united states 
if any of the events described were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as we incur more indebtedness and greater interest expense  we may not be able to maintain our level of investment in research and development 
the indenture relating to our senior subordinated notes and our credit facility permit us to incur significant amounts of additional debt 
if we incur additional debt  our interest expense will rise 
we may find we do not have enough available cash to pay for the increased interest expense and other budgeted expenses 
we may need to reduce our discretionary expenses  including research and development  which could reduce or delay the introduction of new products 
we may not be able to maintain our level of investment in research and development as we incur more indebtedness and greater interest expense 
certain of our products and manufacturing facilities are subject to regulation  and our failure to obtain or maintain the required regulatory approvals for these products could hinder or prevent their sale and increase our costs of regulatory compliance 
our ability to continue manufacturing and selling those of our products that are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration  state laws or other domestic or foreign governments or agencies is subject to a number of risks  including the promulgation of stricter laws or regulations  reclassification of our products into categories subject to more stringent requirements  or the withdrawal of the approval needed to sell one or more of our products 
the costs of complying with these regulations and the delays in receiving required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new adverse regulations or regulatory requirements may force us to cut back our operations  recall products  increase our costs of regulatory compliance  prevent us from selling a product or hinder our growth 
we may be required to satisfy certain indemnification obligations to apogent  or may not be able to collect on indemnification rights from apogent 
pursuant to the terms of the agreements executed in connection with our spin off from apogent  we and our us subsidiaries  in general  indemnify apogent and its subsidiaries and affiliates against liabilities  litigation and claims actually or allegedly arising out of the dental business  including discontinued operations relating to our business 
similarly  apogent and its us subsidiaries indemnify us and our subsidiaries and affiliates against liabilities  litigation and claims actually or allegedly arising out of apogent s business  including discontinued operations related to the laboratory business  and other operations and assets not transferred to us 
these indemnification obligations could be significant 
the availability of these indemnities will depend upon the future financial strength of each of the companies 
we cannot determine whether we will have substantial indemnification obligations to apogent and its affiliates in the future 
we also cannot assure you that  if apogent has substantial indemnification obligations to us and our affiliates  apogent will have the ability to satisfy those obligations 
except as may be required by applicable securities laws or regulations  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange currency risk management we operate internationally  therefore  our earnings  cash flows  and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables  forecasted sales transactions  as well as net investments in certain foreign operations 
these items are denominated in foreign currencies  including but not limited to the euro  japanese yen  swiss franc  mexican peso  canadian dollar  and the australian dollar 
we believe it is prudent to minimize the variability caused by foreign currency risk 
we attempt to minimize foreign currency risk by using derivative instruments when prudent 
we do not use derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging 
although we have a us dollar functional currency  a substantial portion of our sales  income  and cash flow is derived from foreign currencies 
our foreign currency exposure exists primarily in the euro  japanese yen  canadian dollar  swiss franc  mexican peso and australian dollar versus the us dollar 
with the acquisition of spofadental us on august   we now consider the czech koruna a currency exposure 
for fiscal year  our projected total foreign currency exposure is estimated to be approximately million euros  million japanese yen  million canadian dollars  million australian dollars and million swiss francs 
we have put in place a strategy to manage our euro and japanese yen cash flow exposure through the use of zero cost collar contracts
