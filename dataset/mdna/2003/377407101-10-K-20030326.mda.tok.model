net income for  adjusted to remove the effects of this item  net of taxes  was  net interest income 
the primary component of the company s net income is its net interest income  which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund them 
net interest income is determined by the spread between the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities 
net interest income  divided by average interest earning assets  represents the company s net interest margin 
consolidated net interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the  increase for the most recent year was due to a decrease in the interest expense on deposits combined with an increase in interest income on state and municipal securities  partially offset by a decrease in interest income on loans

asset liability management net interest income  the primary component of the company s net income  arises from the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities and the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities 
the company manages its assets and liabilities by coordinating the levels of and gap between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize changes in net interest income and in the economic value of its equity despite changes in market interest rates 
the bank s asset liability and risk management committee meets on a monthly basis to monitor compliance with the board s objectives 
among other tools used by the asset liability and risk management committee to monitor interest rate risk is a gap report which measures the dollar difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing within a given time period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap position would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income  while  conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income and a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income 
during recent periods  the company has maintained a negative gap position that has benefited earnings as interest rates have fallen 
in order to reduce its negative gap position  the company has recently begun investing in mortgage backed and other government securities which have rates that adjust to market rates 
the company also maintains a significant portfolio of available for sale securities that can be quickly converted to more liquid assets if needed 
the following table sets forth the bank s interest rate sensitivity at december  over to over over months months through years years total dollars in thousands assets cash and due from banks federal funds and overnight deposits securities loans fixed assets other assets total assets liabilities demand deposit accounts now accounts money market deposit accounts savings accounts ira accounts certificates of deposit other liabilities junior subordinated debenture stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity gap cumulative gap cumulative gap as a of total assets the foregoing analysis assumes that the bank s assets and liabilities move with rates at their earliest repricing opportunities based on final maturity 
mortgage backed securities are assumed to mature during the period in which they are estimated to prepay and it is assumed that loans and other securities are not called prior to maturity 
certificates of deposit and ira accounts are presumed to reprice at maturity 
now savings accounts are assumed to reprice within three months although it is the company s experience that such accounts may be less sensitive to changes in market rates 
liquidity and capital resources the company currently has no business other than that of the bank and does not currently have any material funding commitments 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and dividends received from the bank 
the bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the bank s principal sources of funds for investments and operations are net income  deposits from its primary market area  principal and interest payments on loans  interest received on investment securities and proceeds from maturing investment securities

the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which are cash on hand  amounts due from financial institutions  federal funds sold and money market mutual funds 
the levels of such assets are dependent on the bank s operating financing and investment activities at any given time 
the variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated future deposit flows 
cash and cash equivalents cash due from banks  interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  and federal funds sold  as of december   totaled  a decrease of  or  from the december  total of  most of this decrease was due to a decline in deposits in other financial institutions and a reduction in federal funds sold 
as of december   the bank was permitted to draw on a million line of credit from the fhlb of atlanta 
borrowings under the line are secured by a floating lien on the bank s residential mortgage loans and its portfolio of us government and agency securities 
as of december   a million long term convertible advance was outstanding under this line 
in addition the bank has a secured line of credit in the amount of million from another commercial bank on which it has not drawn

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in mature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  starting on page f and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as discussed there  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
management has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities based on historical experience and on various assumptions which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the company reevaluates these variables as facts and circumstances change 
historically  actual results have not differed significantly from the company s estimates 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental accounting estimates and principles involved in the preparation of the company s financial statements  including the identification of the variables most important in the estimation process allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses is management s best estimate of the probable incurred credit losses in the lending portfolio 
the company performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to identify and estimate the inherent risks and assess overall collectibility 
these reviews include loss forecast modeling based on historical experiences and current events and conditions as well as individual loan valuations 
in each analysis  numerous portfolio and economic assumptions are made 
accrued taxes 
management estimates income tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities 
income taxes are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the company s tax position
