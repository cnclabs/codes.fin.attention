agilix is a development stage enterprise that develops software applications  including software for tablet pcs

franklinplanner 
com during fiscal  we discontinued the on line planning services provided at franklinplanner 
com 
the company acquired franklinplanner 
com during fiscal and intended to sell on line planning as a component of our productivity solutions for both organizations and individuals 
however  due to competitors that offered free on line planning and other related factors  we were not able to create a profitable business model for the operations of franklinplanner 
com 
although we were unable to generate revenue from the on line planning services offered at franklinplanner 
com  an on line planning tool was considered a key component of our overall product and services offerings and franklinplanner 
com continued to operate during fiscal and fiscal however  due to lack of demand for its services and the need to reduce operating expenses  we terminated franklinplanner 
com during the fourth quarter of fiscal franklin covey coaching  llc effective september   the company entered into a joint venture agreement with american marketing systems ams to form franklin covey coaching  llc fcc 
each partner owned percent of the joint venture and participated equally in fcc s management 
the fcc joint venture agreement required our coaching programs to achieve specified earnings thresholds beginning in fiscal or the existing joint venture agreement could be terminated at the option of ams 
due to unfavorable economic conditions and other factors  the company s coaching programs did not produce the required earnings during fiscal as a result  ams exercised its option to terminate the existing joint venture agreement effective august  under the provisions of a new partnership agreement that terminated our interest in fcc in october  we received payments totaling million  of which million was received in fiscal refer to note in our consolidated financial statements for further information on the new partnership agreement with franklin covey coaching  llc 
project consulting group during april  the company purchased the project consulting group for million in cash 
the project consulting group provides project consulting  project management  and project methodology training services 
results of operations segment review following the sale of premier during fiscal  we now have two reporting segments the consumer business unit the cbu and the organizational solutions business unit the osbu 
the operating results of premier and our other products and services designed for teachers and students were previously reported in the education business unit  which was dissolved during fiscal our remaining student and teacher programs and products are now classified with osbu results of operations 
consumer business unit this business unit is primarily focused on sales to individual customers and includes the results of the company s domestic retail stores  international retail stores which were closed at august   catalog and ecommerce operations  and other related distribution channels  including wholesale  the government  and office superstores 
the cbu results of operations also include the financial results of our paper planner manufacturing operations 
although cbu sales primarily consist of products such as planners  binders  software  and handheld electronic planning devices  virtually any component of the company s leadership and productivity solutions can be purchased through cbu channels 
organizational solutions business unit the osbu is primarily responsible for the development  marketing  sale  and delivery of productivity  leadership  sales performance  and communication training solutions directly to organizational clients  including other companies  the government  and educational institutions 
the osbu includes the financial results of the organizational solutions group osg and international operations  except for international retail stores 
the osg is responsible for the domestic sale and delivery of productivity  leadership  sales performance  and communication training solutions to corporations and includes sales of training seminars to teachers and students  which were previously reported as part of the education business unit 
the osg is also responsible for consulting services that compliment our productivity and leadership training solutions 
the company s international sales group includes the operating results of our directly owned foreign offices and royalty revenues from licensees 
the following table sets forth selected segment sales and consolidated operational data from continuing operations for the years indicated

year ended august  consumer business unit retail stores    catalog and ecommerce    other cbu    organizational solutions business unit osg    international    total sales    cost of sales    gross margin    selling  general  and administrative    provision for losses on management stock loan program    impairment recovery of investment in unconsolidated subsidiary   loss on impaired assets  depreciation    amortization    loss from continuing operations    fiscal compared to fiscal sales product sales product sales  which primarily consist of planners  binders  software  and handheld electronic planning devices  decreased million  or nine percent  compared to the prior year 
the decline in product sales was primarily attributable to declines in retail and catalog sales 
these declines were partially offset by increased sales from our ecommerce and wholesale channels 
retail store sales declined million  or nine percent  primarily due to reduced traffic 
the unfavorable retail sales trend was reflected in a percent decline in comparable store sales performance comparable stores represent retail stores that have been open longer than one year compared to fiscal as a result of unfavorable operating performance in certain of our retail stores  we closed retail stores in the united states and international locations during fiscal these closures are primarily comprised of unprofitable stores and stores located in markets where the company has multiple retail operations 
we may also close additional retail locations if future analysis demonstrates that our operating performance may be improved through further store closures 
we anticipate that a portion of the sales from these closed stores will transition to other retail store locations or to one of our other product channels 
at august   we were operating domestic retail stores compared to domestic and international stores at august catalog sales declined million  compared to fiscal  reflecting continuing trends of lower call volume through our catalog call center 
however  decreased catalog sales were partially offset by million of increased sales through our internet web site located at www 
franklincovey 
com 
although total sales from the catalog and ecommerce channel are down  the shift of sales from the catalog call center to the internet produced improved operating results for this channel due to the lower operating costs per transaction of our ecommerce operations 
other cbu sales improved primarily due to increased wholesale sales through our contract stationer channel  which produced a million sales increase compared to fiscal training and services sales training solution and related services sales during fiscal decreased by million  or six percent  compared to fiscal the company offers a variety of training solutions  training related products  and consulting services focused on productivity  leadership  sales performance  and communication training programs which are provided through our osbu channels 
the decrease in osg sales  which are primarily domestic training and training product sales  was primarily attributable to decreased sales of customized training products  the elimination of our organizational change consulting group  decreased public seminar sales  and reduced government training sales 
partially offsetting these sales decreases were increases in client facilitated workshops and productivity programs  including our new productivity workshop entitled  focus achieving your highest priorities 
international sales decreased million  or one percent  compared to the prior year 
decreased sales in mexico  canada  and europe were partially offset by increased sales in japan  the united kingdom  australia  and increased licensee royalty revenue 
gross margin gross margin consists of sales less cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes materials used in the production of planners and related products  assembly and manufacturing labor costs  direct costs of conducting seminars  freight  and certain other overhead costs 
gross margin may be affected by  among other things  prices of materials  labor rates  product sales mix  changes in product discount levels  production efficiency  and freight costs 
our overall gross margin for fiscal improved slightly to percent of sales compared to percent in the prior year 
gross margin on product sales decreased to percent compared to percent in the prior year 
the decline in our product gross margin was chiefly attributable to the following three factors the substantial discounting of a number of slower moving products in order to liquidate this merchandise  a shift in our product mix toward technology products  including tablet pcs and handheld electronic devices  which generally have lower gross margins than the majority of our other products  and in response to general market trends  significant promotional discounts were used on certain products to enhance sales 
partially offsetting these factors during fiscal were the favorable results from focused cost cutting initiatives aimed at reducing our production costs for paper related products and decreasing the purchase price of our binder products 
training solution and services gross margin  as a percent of sales  improved to percent in fiscal  compared to percent in the prior year 
the improvement in training solutions gross margin was primarily due to decreased sales of customized training products and the elimination of our organizational change consulting practice  both of which typically have lower gross margins than the majority of our other training solution and training product related sales 
additionally  higher margin facilitator sales continued to improve and had a favorable impact on our gross margin percentage in fiscal operating expenses selling  general  and administrative our selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses decreased million  or percent  compared to fiscal sg a expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal decreased sg a expenses were the result of initiatives specifically designed to reduce our overall operating costs 
these successful cost cutting initiatives resulted in associate expense reductions totaling million  reductions in other sg a expenses  including outsourcing  consulting  and development  that totaled million  and advertising and promotional expense reductions totaling million  compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these cost reduction efforts were additional expenses generated from closing stores in fiscal  as discussed below 
as a result of changing administrative space needs and cost cutting efforts  we also vacated a portion of our corporate campus in salt lake city  utah and are actively seeking to lease the vacant space 
in order to further improve our financial results and reduce operating costs  our management regularly evaluates our business activities and operating segment financial results and may implement additional cost cutting initiatives 
we regularly assess the operating performance of our retail stores  including previous operating performance trends and projected future profitability 
during this assessment process  judgments are made as to whether under performing or unprofitable stores should be closed 
as a result of this evaluation process  we decided to close certain stores during fiscal and fiscal these store closures are comprised of stores that were unprofitable or were located in markets where the company has multiple retail locations 
the costs associated with closing retail stores are typically comprised of charges related to vacating the premises  which may include a provision for the remaining term on the lease  and severance and other personnel costs 
during fiscal  the company closed stores in the united states and international retail stores that were located in canada and mexico 
in connection with these store closures  we incurred and expensed million  which was recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses in fiscal subsequent to august   we have closed stores and intend to close additional stores through the end of the third quarter of fiscal provision for losses on management stock loan program the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
the loan program closed during fiscal with  shares of our common stock purchased by the loan participants for a total cost of million 
the loans in the management stock loan program are full recourse to the participants and are recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
the company utilizes a systematic methodology for determining the level of loan loss reserves that are appropriate for the management common stock loan program 
a key factor considered by our methodology is the current market value of the common stock acquired and held by the participants 
other factors considered by the methodology include the liquid net worth of the participants  the risks of pursuing collection actions against key employees  the probability of sufficient participant repayment capability based upon proximity to the due date of the loans  and other business  economic  and participant factors which may have an impact on our ability to collect the loans 
additionally  the methodology takes into account the fact that we may not hold the participants shares of stock as collateral due to certain laws and regulations 
based upon our reserve methodology  we recorded an increase to the loan loss reserve totaling million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company had aggregate loan loss reserves totaling million and million at august  and august   which reduced notes and interest receivable from financing common stock purchases by related parties in the respective consolidated balance sheets 
at august   the principal amount of the participants loans plus recorded accrued interest exceeded the market value of the common stock acquired by the participants by million  of which million has been reserved 
should the value of the common stock acquired by the participants continue to be insufficient to cover the loans outstanding during the loan term  the loan loss reserve methodology provides a basis to be fully reserved for the difference between the value of the loans outstanding and the market value of the acquired stock  plus estimated collection and other related costs  prior to the march maturity date of the loans 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
the establishment of reserves for potential loan losses on the management common stock loan program requires significant estimates and judgment by the company s management 
these estimates and projections are subject to change as a result of various economic and market factors  most of which are not within our control 
as a result  the reserve for management stock loan losses could fluctuate significantly in future periods 
impairment recovery of investment in unconsolidated subsidiary during fiscal  we entered into a joint venture agreement with american marketing systems to form franklin covey coaching  llc 
the joint venture agreement required the company s coaching programs to achieve specified earnings thresholds in fiscal or the agreement could be terminated by ams 
based upon our coaching program results  and the probability that the joint venture would be terminated  we recorded impairment charges totaling million to our investment in fcc during fiscal ams later exercised its option to terminate the existing joint venture effective august  according to the terms of a new partnership agreement that terminated our interest in fcc during october  we received a million payment at the end of fiscal  we received payments totaling million during the quarter ended march   and we received an additional million from fcc subsequent to august  upon recognition of the above amounts  we first reduced our remaining investment in fcc at august  to zero and then recorded the additional amounts as reversals of the previously recorded impairment charges 
the impairment reversals totaled million in fiscal following the receipt of the final payment under the new partnership agreement  we will not receive any further payments from fcc 
loss on impaired assets during fiscal  we recorded an impaired asset charge of million to expense our remaining investment in agilix due to cash flow sufficiency concerns at agilix 
our loss on impaired assets in fiscal consisted of several write downs of impaired assets including the covey trade name  a note receivable from the sale of subsidiary  and software costs 
for further information  refer to note in our consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense decreased million compared to the prior year primarily due to the full depreciation or disposal of certain computer hardware and software as well as significantly reduced capital expenditures  especially for store build outs and remodeling projects  during fiscal and fiscal however  these factors were partially offset by million of impairment charges and additional depreciation on property and equipment at retail stores that were closed during fiscal and that are expected to be closed through the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we recorded million of impairment charges on property and equipment in retail stores that was also recorded as a component of depreciation expense 
we anticipate that depreciation expense will continue to decrease during fiscal  which reflects focused capital spending trends in fiscal and fiscal amortization expense on definite lived intangible assets totaled million compared to million during fiscal we expect definite lived intangible asset amortization to total approximately million in fiscal for further information regarding our intangible assets and expected amortization expense  refer to note in our consolidated financial statements 
equity in the earnings losses of an unconsolidated subsidiary our fiscal loss of million represents our portion of the losses from our approximately percent ownership interest in agilix 
as previously discussed  during fiscal we impaired our remaining investment of approximately million and have no further obligations to agilix 
accordingly  we do not expect to record any further losses related to this investment 
our fiscal earnings of million represent our share of fcc s net income 
following the termination of the previous fcc partnership agreement on august   we ceased recording our share of fcc s income 
refer to the discussion above under impairment recovery of investment in unconcolidated subsidiary regarding our treatment of payments from fcc under the new partnership agreement 
interest income and expense interest income declined by million during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily the result of ceasing to record interest income from the participants in the management common stock loan program during the quarter ended february  although the participants in the management common stock loan program remain liable for the interest accrued on their loans  we discontinued recording interest income due to uncertainties as to the ultimate collection of these amounts 
interest on participant loans is due and payable when the loans mature in march interest expense decreased by million due to reduced debt balances primarily resulting from the payment and termination of our term loan and line of credit agreement  which occurred during fiscal in connection with the sale of premier 
other income and expense during fiscal  we sold two buildings located in the salt lake city  utah area 
as a result of these sales  we recorded net losses totaling million 
during fiscal  we sold a building located in chandler  arizona and recognized a million gain 
income taxes the income tax benefit for fiscal was primarily attributable to reversal of accruals related to the resolution of certain tax matters and a foreign income tax benefit related to our japan operations 
in fiscal  our benefit was primarily attributable to our ability to net the taxable loss from continuing operations against the taxable gain on the sale of premier 
as of august  and  given our recent history of significant operating losses  we had provided a valuation allowance against substantially all of our deferred income tax assets 
as of august   we had net deferred tax assets of million  which related to our operations in japan 
for further information concerning deferred tax items  including our net operating loss carryforwards  refer to note in our consolidated financial statements 
preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends increased compared to the prior year due to the issuance of additional shares of series a preferred stock as payment for accrued preferred stock dividends during fiscal subsequent to july  the terms of the series a preferred stock agreement require that all future series a preferred stock dividends be paid in cash 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales during fiscal  our overall operating performance was adversely affected by significant sales declines compared to prior years 
the company believes that difficult economic conditions in the united states  which were worsened by the terrorist attacks that occurred on september   led to significantly reduced travel schedules for training and tightened budgets for productivity tool and educational expenditures as our corporate clients sought to reduce their operating expenses 
in addition  sales of handheld electronic planning devices  which were especially popular during fiscal and fiscal  declined sharply in fiscal due to a significant reduction in the demand for these devices 
as a result of these and other factors  we experienced significant sales declines compared to the prior year for both training and productivity tools in our various channels 
product sales sales of our planners  binders  handheld electronic planning devices  and other products declined by million  or percent  compared to the prior year 
the overall decrease in product sales was significant to our retail store  catalog ecommerce  and other consumer business unit channels 
retail store sales were adversely affected by declining average sales dollars per transaction combined with a decrease in consumer traffic and overall smaller number of transactions 
of the million decline in retail store sales  approximately million related to declines in the sales of handheld electronic planning devices and related accessories 
of this decline  nearly million occurred during our first two fiscal quarters of fiscal planner and binder sales through our retail stores also decreased by a total of percent compared to the prior year 
these product sales declines included a percent decline during the first two quarters compared to an eight percent decline during the last two quarters of fiscal as a result of these sales trends  comparable store stores that have been open for over a year sales decreased by percent compared to fiscal comparable store sales experienced a percent decrease during the first two quarters of fiscal versus a percent decrease during our last two quarters of the fiscal year 
the sales performance from new stores partially offset the decline in comparable store sales  resulting in a percent overall decline in retail store sales compared to fiscal as of august   we were operating domestic retail stores compared to stores at august  catalog ecommerce sales declined primarily due to reduced call volume in the company s call center operations  particularly during the first two quarters of fiscal  and to average order size  due primarily to declines in handheld electronic planning device sales 
training and services sales training solution and training product related sales decreased by million  or percent  compared to fiscal  which was reflected in both domestic and foreign training sales during fiscal with the impact of a weak domestic economy  which generally influences corporate  governmental  and educational spending  training sales during fiscal decreased due to reduced spending for both company facilitator led and on site training programs 
public program sales and training solutions sales to teachers and students in the education industry also decreased compared to fiscal sales levels 
these decreases were partially offset by sales performance seminars  which increased compared to fiscal international product and training sales decreased slightly compared to fiscal primarily due to decreased sales in mexico  canada  continental europe  and australia 
these declines were partially offset by increased sales from brazil and the united kingdom 
sales in japan and royalty revenues from licensee operations were essentially flat compared to fiscal during fiscal  the continental european direct office was converted to a licensee operation  which resulted in reduced sales  but increased margins 
the company also attributes a portion of the decrease in international sales to similar economic factors that had an adverse affect on domestic product and training sales during fiscal gross margin the company s overall gross margin during fiscal decreased to percent of sales  compared to percent in fiscal the decline in overall gross margin was primarily due to factors that adversely affected our gross margin during the first and second quarters of fiscal for both products and training 
during our seasonally strong sales months in early fiscal  manufacturers of handheld electronic planning devices discounted numerous models  products  and accessories in order to promote sales 
these product discounts reduced the sale price of many of our handheld electronic devices  resulting in narrower margins for these products 
we also experienced a shortage of certain popular paper planner products due to the bankruptcy of one of our key printing suppliers 
this condition resulted in lost sales and backorders of high margin products 
when these backordered products were eventually shipped to customers  we used more expensive overnight delivery methods  which produced increased costs that could not be passed on to our customers 
the company also experienced a shift in our product mix toward lower margin binders and planners during fiscal as a result of these and other related factors  our gross margin on product sales declined to percent compared to percent during fiscal training solution costs  as a percentage of sales  increased due to a shift in the product mix of training solutions sold in addition to lower attendance at corporate on site and public seminar events held during the year 
the cancellation and postponement of numerous seminars due to travel restrictions and declining travel by our clients in the wake of the terrorist attacks of september   significantly affected the gross margin of seminar sales during the first and second quarters of fiscal certain cost components of public seminars are fixed  such as direct marketing expenses  site fees  equipment rentals  and presenter costs 
with a decline in the average number of participants per public training seminar  the fixed costs required for each training seminar resulted in lower gross margins for these events 
in addition  some costs incurred for canceled seminars were not refundable 
during fiscal  we also developed a custom line of training related products for a specific customer that had significantly lower margins than the majority of our other training kits  products  and accessories 
these unfavorable factors combined to reduce the training and service gross margin to percent of sales  compared to percent in fiscal operating expenses selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased million  but due to decreased sales  increased as a percent of sales to percent  compared to percent in fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses was primarily due to specific initiatives that were implemented to reduce recurring operating expenses and to exit non core activities in order to focus on and align corporate strategy and improve overall profitability 
these cost reduction initiatives resulted in significantly decreased associate  advertising  travel  and computer and office supply expenses  especially during our third and fourth fiscal quarters of fiscal partially offsetting these cost reduction efforts were severance costs  additional retail store costs related to new stores opened during fiscal  and outsourcing implementation costs 
in connection with our decision to exit non core and unprofitable activities  we reduced our employee base during fiscal as a result of these headcount reduction efforts  the company incurred and expensed million of severance and related costs during fiscal during fiscal  we entered into long term outsourcing agreements with electronic data systems eds to provide warehousing  distribution  information systems  and call center operations 
in addition to base charges for services provided  we incurred and expensed transition costs necessary to operate under terms of the agreements 
provision for losses on management stock loan program the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
the loans in the management stock loan program are full recourse to the participants and are recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
the company utilizes a systematic methodology for determining the level of loan loss reserves that are appropriate for the management common stock loan program 
based upon our reserve methodology  we recorded an increase to the loan loss reserve of million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal the company had aggregate loan loss reserves totaling million and million at august  and august   which reduced notes and interest receivable from financing common stock purchases by related parties in the respective consolidated balance sheets 
impairment of investment in unconsolidated subsidiary we recorded impairment charges totaling million to write down our investment in fcc during fiscal as a result of the expected termination of our joint venture agreement with ams 
for further information  refer to the discussion in our fiscal compared to fiscal section 
loss on impaired assets we regularly review our long lived assets for circumstances or events that indicate an asset may not be recoverable 
our losses on impaired assets consisted of the following in thousands year ended august  covey trade name  note receivable from sale of subsidiary  capitalized software development costs  computer software  other during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reassessed the carrying value of the covey trade name  an indefinite lived intangible asset under the provisions of sfas no 
due to declining sales and estimated future sales associated with the covey trade name  the company recorded a million impairment charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal the note receivable from the sale of the commercial division of publishers press became impaired when the purchaser declared bankruptcy during fiscal the note receivable was guaranteed by the parent company of the purchaser  however  the parent company also became insolvent during fiscal and the possibility of recovery on the note became remote 
we regularly review our property and equipment and capitalized computer software for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be realizable 
based upon unfavorable sales trends and projected sales information  the company recorded impairment charges totaling million and million during fiscal and fiscal for capitalized software development costs related to software products that produced less than expected sales volume 
the company also recorded a million impairment charge related to a customer database management software application  developed and installed by an external company  which became obsolete when we selected a new database software provider 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense from continuing operations increased by million compared to fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of computer software and hardware  and the addition of leasehold improvements in new and remodeled retail stores 
amortization expense attributable to continuing operations decreased by million  primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
 which prohibits goodwill amortization and requires a fair value approach  with periodic assessments for impairments  to value goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
as a result of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
 we wrote off all recorded goodwill associated with our consumer business unit  organizational solutions business unit  and corporate services group  plus a portion of the covey trade name intangible asset  which has an indefinite life  from our balance sheet as of september  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our intangible assets and the impact of adopting sfas no 
interest income and expense interest income and expense were primarily influenced by cash received from the sale of premier  which occurred on december   and the reduction of recorded interest income from management stock loan program participants 
the company used a substantial portion of the proceeds from the sale of premier to repay and terminate our existing term note and line of credit agreement 
in addition  in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  we stopped recording interest income from participants of the management stock loan program 
the management stock loan program participants are still liable for the interest expense on their loans  which are due in march primarily as a result of these items  the company s interest income was essentially flat compared to the prior year and interest expense decreased by million compared to fiscal other income during fiscal  we sold a building located in chandler  arizona 
the gain on the sale of the building was million and was recorded as other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for fiscal income taxes the net income tax benefit from continuing operations in fiscal totaled million  compared to million in fiscal the fiscal tax benefit resulted primarily from our ability to net the taxable loss from continuing operations against the taxable gain on the sale of premier 
the fiscal income tax benefit resulted primarily from our ability to net the taxable loss from continuing operations against the taxable income from the operations of premier 
gain on sale of discontinued operations effective december   we sold premier to school specialty  inc  a company that specializes in providing products and services to students and schools 
premier provided productivity and leadership solutions to the education industry  including student and teacher planners 
the sale price was million in cash  plus the retention of premier s working capital  which was received in the form of a million promissory note from the purchaser 
prior to the sale closing  we received cash distributions from premier s working capital that totaled approximately million 
we received full payment on the promissory note plus accrued interest during june we recognized a pretax gain of million million after applicable taxes on the sale of premier 
cumulative effect of accounting change we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on september  the new reporting provisions of sfas no 
prohibit the amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets and require those assets to be periodically assessed and written down to fair value  if necessary 
in connection with the implementation of sfas no 
 we hired an independent valuation firm to assess the value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles in accordance with the new measurement requirements prescribed by sfas no 
based upon the results of the valuation  all of the goodwill assigned to the organizational solutions business unit  the consumer business unit  and corporate support group  as well as a portion of the covey trade name intangible asset  were impaired 
the resulting impairment charge from the adoption of sfas no 
totaled million million after applicable tax benefits and was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends increased compared to fiscal due to the issuance of additional shares of series a preferred stock as payment for accrued preferred stock dividends during fiscal quarterly results the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated financial data for fiscal and fiscal the quarterly consolidated financial data reflects  in the opinion of management  all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of operations for such periods and was revised to classify the operational results of premier and franklinplanner 
com as discontinued operations 
in addition  the following quarterly information for fiscal was revised to reflect the cumulative effect of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
 which was retroactively recorded in our first quarter of fiscal as required by sfas no

the company s quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of customers who renew their franklin covey planners on a calendar year basis 
osg sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training  which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and vacation periods 
after the sale of premier in fiscal  the seasonal nature of our operations will reflect higher sales and significantly higher operating margins during the first and second quarters  with declines in sales and income generally occurring during the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year 
quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the sale of business units  the introduction of new products or training seminars  the addition of new institutional customers  the timing of large corporate orders  the elimination of unprofitable products or training services  and the closure of retail stores 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of capital have been net cash provided by operating activities  long term borrowings  line of credit financing  asset sales  and the issuance of preferred and common stock 
working capital requirements have also been financed through short term borrowings  line of credit financing  and asset sales 
during fiscal  we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of premier to retire substantially all of our outstanding debt and terminate our line of credit agreement 
we have not sought to obtain a new line of credit financing agreement subsequent to this transaction 
with significantly reduced debt balances  current levels of cash on hand  and improved cash flows from operating activities  we believe that our liquidity is adequate for the succeeding twelve months 
however  the maintenance of adequate liquidity in future periods is dependent upon our ability to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and our ability to control capital expenditures 
our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is primarily dependent upon stabilization of revenues and the reduction of operating costs associated with generating those revenues 
our liquidity position may also be affected by future investing and financing activities  including the potential sale and leaseback of our salt lake city administrative campus 
cash flows from operating activities during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  compared to million of net cash used for operating activities during fiscal the company s non cash adjustments to reported net loss included million of depreciation and amortization charges and million for increases to our management common stock loan loss reserve during the year 
partially offsetting these non cash adjustments was the recovery of million of previously recorded impairment charges to our investment in fcc 
the primary use of cash for operating activities was the payment of income taxes  which totaled million and was primarily related to the sale of premier s canadian operations 
our primary sources of cash from operating activities included a million increase in our accounts payable  outsourcing contract costs payable  and accrued liabilities balances  primarily due to increased outsourcing contract costs payable to eds  and a million decline in other assets 
during fiscal  we negotiated a revised payment schedule related to our outsourcing contracts with eds for outstanding invoices from december through may these payments were postponed until certain software system implementation issues were resolved 
as part of the revised payment schedule  we will make payments to eds beginning in june through february that will bring us current approximately million on our liability with eds 
these payments will be in addition to required minimum contract costs as disclosed below in our contractual obligations section of this liquidity and capital resources discussion 
these payments will not increase our costs of operations since the obligation was expensed as it was incurred  but the payments will reduce our cash flows from operating activites as we reduce our payable to eds 
we believe that our current and planned cost cutting initiatives combined with continued sales stabilization and growth efforts  including new products  services  and related marketing programs  will improve our cash flows from operating activities in future periods 
however  the success of these efforts is dependent upon numerous factors  some of which are not within our control 
cash flows from investing activities and capital expenditures net cash used for investing activities totaled million during fiscal our primary uses of cash for investing activities included million of cash used to purchase computer hardware and software  leasehold improvements in new stores  and other property and equipment  combined with million used to purchase approximately percent of the capital stock on a fully diluted basis of agilix labs  inc partially offsetting these uses of cash for investing activities were the receipt of million from our share of fcc earnings under a new partnership agreement that terminates our interest in fcc in october  and million of cash proceeds  which were primarily derived from the sale of certain property and equipment 
consistent with fiscal  we reduced capital spending during fiscal in order to focus our capital resources on business critical equipment and projects 
we intend to continue this focus on capital expenditures during fiscal and future periods 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities during fiscal totaled million 
following the payment and termination of our term loan and line of credit agreement during fiscal  our primary use of cash for financing activities in fiscal has been the payment of accrued series a preferred stock dividends  which totaled million during fiscal contractual obligations the company has not structured any special purpose or variable interest entities  or participated in any commodity trading activities  which would expose us to potential undisclosed liabilities or create adverse consequences to our liquidity 
required contractual payments primarily consist of payments to electronic data systems eds for outsourcing services related to information systems  warehousing and distribution  and call center operations  minimum rent payments for retail store and sales office space  cash payments for series a preferred stock dividends  monitoring fees paid to a series a preferred stock investor  and mortgage payments on certain buildings and property 
our expected payments on these obligations over the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows in thousands description thereafter total minimum required payments to eds for outsourcing services     additional required payments to eds   minimum operating lease payments       series a preferred stock dividend payments      monitoring fees paid to a preferred stock investor debt payments   total expected contractual obligation payments     other items the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
these loans  which are full recourse to the participants  are recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
for further information regarding our management common stock loan program  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
going forward  we will continue to incur costs necessary for the operation and potential growth of the business 
we anticipate using cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities on the condition that we can return to generating sufficient positive cash flows from operations  and other financing alternatives  if necessary  for these expenditures 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources should be adequate to enable us to maintain our operations for the upcoming twelve months 
however  our ability to maintain adequate capital for our operations beyond that point in time is dependent upon a number of factors  including sales trends  our ability to contain costs  levels of capital expenditures  collection of accounts receivable  and other factors 
some of the factors that influence our operations are not within our control  such as economic conditions and the introduction of new technology and products by our competitors 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may pursue additional financing alternatives  if required  to maintain sufficient resources for future growth and capital requirements 
however  there can be no assurance such financing alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms 
use of estimates and critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions and bases those estimates and assumptions on historical experience  factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  including changes in economic conditions and other circumstances that are not in our control  but which may have an impact on these estimates and our actual financial results 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for product sales  these conditions are generally met upon shipment of the product to the customer or by completion of the sale transaction in a retail store 
for training and service sales  these conditions are generally met upon presentation of the training seminar  delivery of the consulting services  or shipment of the training manuals and related products 
revenue is recognized on software sales in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition 
for sales contracts that have been entered into after june  that contain multiple deliverables  each element of the contract is analyzed and treated as a separate earnings process if it meets the specified requirements of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
if those requirements are not met  revenue is determined for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting 
revenue from multiple deliverable contracts is recognized upon completion of the contracted terms for each element 
revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and product returns 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
our inventories are comprised primarily of dated calendar products and other non dated products such as binders  handheld electronic devices  stationery  training products  and other accessories 
provision is made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we make judgments regarding future demand requirements and compare these assessments with current and committed inventory levels 
inventory requirements may change based on projected customer demand  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
indefinite lived intangible assets intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the covey trade name intangible asset has been deemed to have an indefinite life 
this intangible asset is assigned to the organizational solutions business unit and is tested for impairment using the present value of estimated royalties derived from trade name related revenues  which consist primarily of training seminars and related products 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our indefinite lived intangible asset change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
impairment of long lived assets long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets  over the remaining useful lives in determining whether the assets are recoverable 
if the carrying values of the assets exceed the anticipated future cash flows of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying values of the assets and their estimated fair values 
impairment of long lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets 
the evaluation of long lived assets requires us to use estimates of future cash flows 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long lived tangible and definite lived intangible assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
loan loss reserve for management common stock loan program the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
these loans are full recourse to the participants and are recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
in order to assess the net realizable value of these loans  we utilize a systematic methodology for determining the level of loan loss reserves that are appropriate for the management common stock loan program 
a key factor considered by the methodology is the current market value of the common stock acquired by the participants 
other factors considered by the methodology include the liquid net worth of the participants  the risks of pursuing collection actions against key employees  the probability of sufficient participant repayment capability based upon proximity to the due date of the loans  and other business  economic  and participant factors which may have an impact on our ability to collect the loans 
we assess the adequacy of our allowance on a quarterly basis and adjust the allowance based upon the results of the assessment 
during the quarter ended august   we recorded a million increase to our loan loss reserves that utilized the average market closing price of our common stock over the last four weeks of the fiscal quarter  which was per share  as the market value of the common stock acquired by the participants 
the following table presents an analysis of the variation in the loan loss reserve that may have resulted from different common stock market valuations for the quarter ended august  the other common stock prices presented are intended to provide a reasonable range of possible outcomes considering the trading activity of our common stock during the fourth quarter of fiscal in thousands  except per share amounts market value of common stock per share required loan loss reserve increase decrease to loan loss reserve additionally  our loan loss methodology takes into account the fact that the company may not hold the participants shares of stock as collateral due to certain laws and regulations 
should the value of the common stock acquired by the participants continue to be insufficient to cover the loans outstanding during the loan term  our loan loss reserve methodology provides a basis to be fully reserved for the difference between the value of the loans outstanding and the market value of the acquired stock  plus estimated collection and other related costs  prior to the march maturity date of the loans 
income taxes the calculation of our income tax provision or benefit  as applicable  requires estimates of future taxable income or losses 
during the course of the fiscal year  these estimates are compared to actual financial results and adjustments may be made to our tax provision or benefit to reflect these revised estimates 
our recent history of significant operating losses precludes us from demonstrating that it is more likely than not that the related benefits from deferred income tax deductions and foreign tax carryforwards will be realized 
accordingly  we recorded valuation allowances on our deferred income tax assets 
these valuation allowances are based on estimates of future taxable income or losses that may or may not be realized 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this new statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both debt and equity 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply to the classification and disclosure requirements for the following three types of financial instruments mandatorily redeemable instruments  instruments with repurchase obligations  and instruments with obligations to issue a variable number of securities 
the new reporting and disclosure requirements of sfas no 
become effective for the first interim period beginning after june  or for any covered instruments entered into or modified subsequent to may  the company adopted sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and it did not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
under sfas no 
 a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
a liability is incurred when an event obligates the entity to transfer or use assets ie  when an event leaves a company with little or no discretion to avoid transferring or using the assets in the future 
under previous accounting rules  if a company s management approved an exit plan  the company could generally record the costs of that plan as a liability on the approval date  even if the company did not incur the costs until a later date 
under sfas no 
 some of those costs might qualify for immediate recognition  others may be spread over one or more quarters  and still others might not be recorded until incurred in a much later period 
the company adopted sfas no 
during fiscal  and it did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in july  president george w 
bush signed the sarbanes oxley act of the act into law 
the act prescribes  among other items  sweeping corporate governance and oversight changes  new reporting responsibilities for internal controls  and requires our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to certify the accuracy of filed reports 
the various provisions of the act have phase in provisions and become effective at different times in the future 
subsequent to the signing of the act into law  we have been actively engaged in defining policies and procedures that will bring us into compliance with the various provisions of the act 
as we implement the various sections of the act  we have incurred  and may continue to incur  costs associated with additional auditing  legal  and consulting fees in order to ensure compliance with the act 
these additional costs may have a material impact on our operating results 
regulatory compliance the company is registered in states that have a sales tax and collects and remits sales or use tax on retail sales made through its stores and catalog sales 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations 
inflation and changing prices inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
however  future inflation may have an impact on the price of materials used in the production of planners and related products  including paper and leather materials 
the company may not be able to pass on such increased costs to our customers 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of certain written and oral statements made by the company or our representatives in this report  other reports  filings with the securities and exchange commission  press releases  conferences  internet webcasts  or otherwise  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may predict  forecast  indicate  or imply future results  performance  or achievements  and may contain words such as believe  anticipate  expect  estimate  project  or words or phrases of similar meaning 
forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties are disclosed from time to time in reports filed by us with the sec  including reports on forms k  q  and k 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  unanticipated developments in any one or more of the following areas the risk that our revenues will continue to decline  our ability to reduce costs sufficiently to permit profitable operations at reduced revenue levels  the ability to maintain revenues at a sufficient level to recognize anticipated benefits from the eds outsourcing agreements  unanticipated costs or capital expenditures  changes in consumer preferences and difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in customer preferences or consumer demand for our products and services  difficulties encountered by eds in implementing  operating  and maintaining our information systems and controls  including without limitation  the systems related to demand and supply planning  inventory control  and order fulfillment  delays or unanticipated outcomes relating to the company s strategic plans  availability of financing sources  dependence on existing products or services  the rate and consumer acceptance of new product introductions  competition  the number and nature of customers and their product orders  including changes in the timing or mix of product or training orders  pricing of our products and services and those of competitors  adverse publicity  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and other factors which may adversely affect our business 
in recent periods  the company has faced declining revenues 
our sales for the year ended august  were million compared to million in fiscal over these periods  we have substantially reduced our operating expenses 
however  if our revenues continue to decline  we may be unable to rapidly reduce operating expenses sufficiently to achieve profitable operations due to contractual obligations and other fixed costs of our business 
while the company has a broad customer base  we are also subject to variables over which we have no direct control  such as innovations in competing products  changing corporate policies on the part of our customers  and competition from others in the industry 
in addition  we are subject to changes in costs of supplies necessary to produce and distribute our products 
the company s business is also subject to seasonal variations and international sales 
sales outside the united states potentially present additional risks such as political  social  and economic instability  as well as currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the risks included here are not exhaustive 
other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
moreover  we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors may emerge and it is not possible for our management to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any single factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not rely on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
the market price of our common stock has been and may remain volatile 
in addition  the stock markets in general have recently experienced increased volatility 
factors such as quarter to quarter variations in revenues and earnings or losses and our failure to meet expectations could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the price of our common stock can change for reasons unrelated to our performance 
due to our low market capitalization  the price of our common stock may also be affected by conditions such as a lack of analyst coverage and fewer potential investors 
forward looking statements are based on management s expectations as of the date made  and the company does not undertake any responsibility to update any of these statements in the future 
actual future performance and results will differ and may differ materially from that contained in or suggested by forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in our filings with the sec 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk of financial instruments the company is exposed to financial instrument market risk primarily through fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rates  we make limited use of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from one or more underlying financial instruments 
as a matter of policy  our derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions that are independent of those exposures 
in addition  we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the notional amounts of derivatives do not represent actual amounts exchanged by the parties to the instrument  and  thus  are not a measure of exposure to us through our use of derivatives 
additionally  we enter into derivative agreements only with highly rated counterparties and we do not expect to incur any losses resulting from non performance by other parties 
foreign exchange sensitivity due to the global nature of our operations  we are involved in transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  which creates exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
during fiscal and fiscal  we utilized foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of certain intercompany financing transactions and other transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
these contracts did not meet specific hedge accounting requirements and corresponding gains and losses on these contracts were recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of august   all of our foreign currency forward contracts were settled 
our use of foreign currency forward contracts resulted in net losses to the company totaling million during fiscal  compared to a net loss of million during fiscal in future periods  we may continue to use foreign currency forward contracts to manage our foreign currency exchange risks 
interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to fluctuations in us interest rates primarily as a result of the cash and cash equivalents that we hold 
following payment and termination of our line of credit facility during fiscal  our remaining debt balances consist of fixed rate long term mortgages on certain of our buildings and property 
the following table summarizes our remaining debt obligations at august  for presentation purposes  the reported interest rates represent weighted average rates on our fixed rate debt balances in thousands 
maturity fiscal year description thereafter fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt none average interest rate none at august   we were not party to any interest rate swap agreements or similar derivative instruments
