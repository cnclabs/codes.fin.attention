net interest income net interest income  the company s principal source of earnings  is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets 
factors that determine the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  yields earned and rates paid  the level of non performing loans and the amount of non interest bearing liabilities supporting earning assets 
net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
the adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate for  and  respectively 
the year ended represents the first full year that the company was able to fully utilize the changes in the arkansas usury law made possible through the gramm leach bliley act  which was confirmed by the eighth circuit court of appeals in october this ability to reprice the loan portfolio  coupled with the ongoing repricing of the deposit base that was driven by the federal reserve s lowering of interest rates  has enabled the company to achieve considerable improvement in both net interest income and net interest margin 
for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million  an increase of million  or  from the same period in the increase in net interest income was the result of a million decrease in fully taxable equivalent interest income and a million decrease in interest expense 
the decrease in interest income was the result of a lower yield earned on earning assets 
the decrease in interest expense was the result of a lower cost of funds 
the net interest margin improved basis points to for the year ended december   when compared to for the same period in for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million  an increase of approximately  or  from net interest income 
the increase in in net interest income was the result of a  decrease in fully taxable equivalent interest income and a  decrease in interest expense 
interest income decreased from to as a result of a lower yield earned on earning assets  which was offset from the increase in the average balance of earning assets 
the decrease in interest expense from to was the result of a lower cost of funds  which was offset by the increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities

the provision for  and was  and million  respectively 
during the reporting year ended  the company experienced an increase in classified assets at one community bank subsidiary 
thus  the company increased the provision for loan losses at that subsidiary during the year ended while the company s asset quality improved during  there continued to be significant uncertainties in the united states economy and concerns over the downturn in the catfish industry that affects one of the company s community banks 
for that reason  management continued with an increased level of provision during non interest income total non interest income was million in  compared to million in and million in non interest income is principally derived from recurring fee income  which includes service charges  trust fees and credit card fees 
non interest income also includes income on the sale of mortgage loans and investment banking profits

this increase was attributable to the growth in service charges on deposit accounts offset by the decease in trust fees and credit card fees 
the increase in service charges on deposit accounts for is the result of an improved fee structure 
the decrease in trust fees was primarily the result of lower market valuations in the managed assets of the trust company  which was driven by the downturn in the market conditions of the united states 
while the decrease in credit card fees is the result of increased competitive pressures for that product  which has resulted in a decline of the company s credit card portfolio 
recurring fee income for was million  an increase of million  or  when compared with the figures 
this increase was primarily attributable to the growth in service charges on deposit accounts 
the increase in service charges on deposit accounts for is the result of internal deposit growth  an improved fee structure and the acquisition completed during july during the years ended december  and  income on the sale of mortgage loans and income on investment banking increased  and  respectively  from the years ended in and these increases were the result of a higher volume for those products during and the lower interest rate environment during and primarily drove the volume increases 
during the year ended december   the company recorded several items in other income that are of a non recurring nature 
these items included a gain on the sale one of the company s branch facilities in the northwest arkansas area and higher than normal interest recoveries from interest charged off in prior years 
non interest expense non interest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment  foreclosure losses and other expenses necessary for the operation of the company 
management remains committed to controlling the level of non interest expense  through the continued use of expense control measures that have been installed 
the company utilizes an extensive profit planning and reporting system involving all affiliates 
based on a needs assessment of the business plan for the upcoming year  monthly and annual profit plans are developed  including manpower and capital expenditure budgets 
these profit plans are subject to extensive initial reviews and monitored by management on a monthly basis 
variances from the plan are reviewed monthly and  when required  management takes corrective action intended to ensure financial goals are met 
management also regularly monitors staffing levels at each affiliate  to ensure productivity and overhead are in line with existing workload requirements 
non interest expense for was million  an increase of  or  from the relatively flat non interest expense is primarily due to the increase in salary and employee benefits offset by the decrease in the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
the salary and employee benefits increase is associated with normal salary adjustments  increased cost of health insurance  the opening of a new downtown financial center in little rock  during  and a change in the company s vacation policy 
the vacation policy change created a special non cash expense of  during the first quarter of the decrease in the amortization of intangibles was due to the company adopting the financial accounting standards board sfas no

the company seeks to manage its credit risk by diversifying its loan portfolio  determining that borrowers have adequate sources of cash flow for loan repayment without liquidation of collateral  obtaining and monitoring collateral  providing an adequate allowance for loan losses and regularly reviewing loans through the internal loan review process 
the loan portfolio is diversified by borrower  purpose and industry and  in the case of credit card loans  which are unsecured  by geographic region 
the company seeks to use diversification within the loan portfolio to reduce credit risk  thereby minimizing the adverse impact on the portfolio  if weaknesses develop in either the economy or a particular segment of borrowers 
collateral requirements are based on credit assessments of borrowers and may be used to recover the debt in case of default 
the company uses the allowance for loan losses as a method to value the loan portfolio at its estimated collectible amount 
loans are regularly reviewed to facilitate the identification and monitoring of deteriorating credits 
consumer loans consist of credit card loans  student loans and other consumer loans 
consumer loans were million at december   or of total loans  compared to million  or of total loans at december  the consumer loan decrease from to is the result of a decline in credit cards and indirect lending  which was offset by an increase in student loans 
the credit card portfolio decrease was primarily the result of a decline in the number of cardholder accounts  due to competitive pressure in the credit card industry 
the decline in indirect consumer loans was the result of special finance incentives from car manufacturers and a planned reduction by the company of that product based on the risk reward relationship 
the increase in student loans was a result of greater demand for that product 
real estate loans consist of construction loans  single family residential loans and commercial loans 
real estate loans were million at december   or of total loans  compared to million  or of total loans at december  the real estate loan increase is the result of the acquisition of the monticello branch location during the third quarter of combined with an improved demand for real estate loans

the subsidiary banks recognize income principally on the accrual basis of accounting 
when loans are classified as nonaccrual  the accrued interest is charged off and no further interest is accrued 
loans  excluding credit card loans  are placed on a nonaccrual basis either when there are serious doubts regarding the collectability of principal or interest  or when payment of interest or principal is days or more past due and either i not fully secured or ii not in the process of collection 
if a loan is determined by management to be uncollectable  the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectable is then charged to the allowance for loan losses 
credit card loans are classified as impaired when payment of interest or principal is days past due 
litigation accounts are placed on nonaccrual until such time as deemed uncollectable 
credit card loans are generally charged off when payment of interest or principal exceeds days past due  but are turned over to the credit card recovery department  to be pursued until such time as they are determined  on a case by case basis  to be uncollectable

there was no interest income on the nonaccrual loans recorded for the years ended december   and a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the company will not receive all amounts due according to the contracted terms of the loans 
impaired loans include non performing loans loans past due days or more and nonaccrual loans and certain loans identified by management 
at december   impaired loans were million compared to million in the decrease in impaired loans from december   primarily relates to the million decrease in non performing loans and a million decrease of borrowers that are still performing  but for which management has internally identified as impaired 
management has evaluated the underlying collateral on these loans and has allocated specific reserves in order to absorb potential losses if the collateral were ultimately foreclosed allowance for loan losses an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the last five years is shown in table table allowance for loan losses in thousands balance  beginning of year      loans charged off credit card      other consumer      real estate    commercial      total loans charged off      recoveries of loans previously charged off credit card other consumer real estate commercial total recoveries      net loans charged off      allowance for loan losses of acquired institutions  provision for loan losses      balance  end of year      net charge offs to average loans allowance for loan losses to period end loans allowance for loan losses to net charge offs the amount of provision to the allowance during the year was based on management s judgment  with consideration given to the composition of the portfolio  historical loan loss experience  assessment of current economic conditions  past due loans and net losses from loans charged off for the last five years 
it is management s practice to review the allowance on a monthly basis to determine whether additional provisions should be made to the allowance after considering the factors noted above

the unallocated reserve generally serves to compensate for the uncertainty in estimating loan losses  including the inherent lack of precision of risk ratings and specific reserve allocations 
the unallocated reserve is a result of potential risk factors that cannot be quantified for a particular year end  which could include the risks associated with increased lending  consumer bankruptcies  unfavorable weather conditions or market prices in the agriculture industry  acquisitions and uncertainties in the economy

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity and market risk management parent company the company has leveraged its investment in subsidiary banks and depends upon the dividends paid to it  as the sole shareholder of the subsidiary banks  as a principal source of funds for debt service requirements 
at december   undivided profits of the company s subsidiaries were approximately million  of which approximately million was available for the payment of dividends to the company without regulatory approval 
in addition to dividends  other sources of liquidity for the company are the sale of equity securities and the borrowing of funds 
banking subsidiaries generally speaking  the company s banking subsidiaries rely upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash used in investing activities 
typical of most banking companies  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities  such as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements  and the issuance of long term debt 
the banks primary investing activities include loan originations and purchases of investment securities  offset by loan payoffs and investment maturities 
liquidity represents an institution s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors and borrowers  by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds 
a major responsibility of management is to maximize net interest income within prudent liquidity constraints 
internal corporate guidelines have been established to constantly measure liquid assets  as well as relevant ratios concerning earning asset levels and purchased funds 
the management and board of directors of each bank subsidiary monitor these same indicators and makes adjustments as needed 
at year end  each subsidiary bank was within established guidelines and total corporate liquidity remains strong 
at december   cash and cash equivalents  trading and available for sale securities and mortgage loans held for sale were of total assets  as compared to at december  market risk management market risk arises from changes in interest rates 
the company has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk 
in asset and liability management activities  policies are in place that are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk represents the potential impact of interest rate changes on net income and capital resulting from mismatches in repricing opportunities of assets and liabilities over a period of time 
a number of tools are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including simulation models and interest sensitivity gap analysis 
management uses simulation models to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and various balance sheet strategies on the level of the company s net income and capital 
as a means of limiting interest rate risk to an acceptable level  management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities  change pricing schedules and manage investment maturities during future security purchases 
the simulation models incorporate management s assumptions regarding the level of interest rates or balance changes for indeterminate maturity deposits for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions have been developed through anticipated pricing behavior 
key assumptions in the simulation models include the relative timing of prepayments  cash flows and maturities 
in addition  the impact of planned growth and anticipated new business is factored into the simulation models 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the models cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of a change in interest rates on net income or capital 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
the table below presents the company s interest rate sensitivity position at december  this gap analysis is based on a point in time and may not be meaningful because assets and liabilities are categorized according to contractual maturities investment securities are according to call dates and repricing periods rather than estimating more realistic behaviors  as is done in the simulation models 
also  the gap analysis does not consider subsequent changes in interest rate level or spreads between asset and liability categories
