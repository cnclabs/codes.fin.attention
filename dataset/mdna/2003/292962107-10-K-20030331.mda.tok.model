at december   the company had sold of these extended maintenance agreements with hardware upgrades  but the revenue from these sales was deferred and will be recognized during and thereafter in some cases depending on the length of the extended maintenance period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had approximately million of cash and investments on december  the company received proceeds of  from a private placement of  shares of its common stock to accredited investors in january substantially all of this cash is invested in money market funds 
because of the credit risk criteria of the company s investment policies  the primary market risk associated with these investments is interest rate risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of the company s investments  however  because management considers it unlikely that the company would need or choose to substantially liquidate the company s investments prior to their maturity  management believes that such an increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
even though the company conducts sales in foreign currencies through its european subsidiary  management does not believe the company is exposed to any material foreign currency exchange rate risk
