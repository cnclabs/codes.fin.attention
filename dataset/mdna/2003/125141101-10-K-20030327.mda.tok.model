item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity 
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from contracts  which are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this method requires a higher degree of management judgment and use of estimates than other revenue recognition methods 
the judgments and estimates involved include management s ability to accurately estimate the contracts percentage of completion and the reasonableness of the estimated costs to complete  among other factors  at each financial reporting period 
in addition  certain contracts are highly dependent on the work of contractors and other subcontractors participating in a project  over which we have no or limited control  and their performance on such project could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts 
delays resulting from these contractors and subcontractors  changes in the scope of the project  weather  and labor availability also can have an effect on a contracts profitability 
contract costs include direct material  labor costs  and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  and other overhead expenses 
selling and administrative expenses are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes to job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability may result in revisions to contract revenue and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are made 
we provided for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts of  and  at december  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill we review the carrying value of our long lived assets held for use and assets to be disposed of 
for all assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset 
if this occurs  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds its fair value 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this new accounting standard  we will no longer amortize our goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life and will be required to complete an annual impairment test 
we have determined that we have a single reporting unit  as defined in sfas no 
 within our company 
we completed our impairment test during as required by this accounting standard and have not recognized an impairment charge related to the adoption of this accounting standard in the impairment test requires us to forecast our future cash flows  which requires significant judgment 
as of december   we have million of goodwill  
million of intangible assets finite life  million of indefinite life intangible assets  and million of property  plant  and equipment recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes and tax valuation allowances we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and will provide necessary valuation allowances as required 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
if we continue to operate at a loss or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to record a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results 
gross deferred tax assets and gross deferred tax liabilities at december  totaled million and million  respectively 
risk management activities we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate and foreign currency exposures 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we may enter into hedging relationships such that changes in the fair values or cash flows of items and transactions being hedged are expected to be offset by corresponding changes in the values of the derivatives 
accounting for derivative instruments is complex  as evidenced by the significant interpretations of the primary accounting standard  and continues to evolve 
as of december   there were no significant derivative instruments outstanding 
pension and postretirement benefit plan assumptions we sponsor a pension plan for certain union employees 
we also sponsor a postretirement healthcare benefit plan for certain office employees retiring before january  several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans 
these factors include key assumptions  such as a discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
in addition  our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these liabilities 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension or postretirement healthcare benefit expenses we have recorded or may record in the future 
an analysis for the expense associated with our pension plan is difficult due to the variety of assumptions utilized 
for example  one of the significant assumptions used to determine projected benefit obligation is the discount rate 
at december   a basis point change in the discount rate would change the projected benefit obligation by approximately  and the annual post retirement expense by less than  additionally  a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would change the projected benefit obligation by approximately  other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  which discusses accounting policies that must be selected by us when there are acceptable alternatives 
the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto including note  segment and related information and other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and reflect our operations consolidated with the operations of our subsidiaries 
the following table sets forth line items shown on the consolidated statements of operations  as a percentage of total net sales  for the years ended december   and this table should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
year ended december  net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling and administrative depreciation and amortization income from operations before other income and interest expense other income expense 


interest expense loss before income taxes 

provision benefit for income taxes 


net loss 


vs 
consolidated net sales decreased  or million to million 
sales were down mainly because of a the weakness in the industrial segment of the us economy  b divestitures of two non core businesses  air purator corporation and busch martec that amounted to million of decreased sales  and c the abandonment of our expansion into the highly engineered specialty piping for automotive paint facilities started in  which amounted to million of decreased sales 
one of our targeted growth areas  thermal oxidation technology  sold under the ceco abatement trade name  had a strong first full year of operations  by generating over million of orders from alternative energy providers 
we began with a strong backlog million 
orders booked in were million compared with million in the decline resulted from a reduction in large orders from automotive manufacturers and from the metals industries 
smaller orders from customers who represent a cross section of industrial customers in the united states also decreased 
sales of our fiberbed mist eliminator technology  continued to penetrate further into automotive component manufacturers 
in december  we sold the fixed assets and inventory of air purator corp 
apc and received notes totaling  the notes  which were due primarily in march  were secured by the assets of apc 
at december   we deferred the gain on sale of  until collection was reasonably assured 
however  the purchaser defaulted on the loan  and we commenced foreclosure proceedings in may we subsequently sold the assets to the former general manager of apc on july  and recognized a gain on sale during the third and fourth quarters of totaling  the net assets and operations of apc were not material to our consolidated operations 
we also sold the assets of busch martec during because those assets no longer served our vision for future operations 
busch martec s assets are insignificant to the consolidated financial statements 
gross profit excluding depreciation was million in compared with million in gross profit as a percentage of sales was in compared with in even though we a increased margins in on turnkey projects through improved project management and b reduced factory overhead in  the decline in sales caused a net decrease in margin 
gross profit also includes the favorable impact of a recovery of a claim from a contract and the impact from the sale of apc operating assets 
selling and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in selling and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues for were compared to in the decrease is due to cost control and reduction in our workforce 
we reduced our workforce in may and again in september reflecting the consolidation of certain functions  efficiencies and lower sales volume 
on an annualized basis  the full impact on cost control initiatives is expected to result in a savings of approximately million  which began to be realized during the third quarter of the period included certain non recurring adjustments of  related to a customer bankruptcy and other contingencies which reduced selling and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization decreased million to million in year ended december  primarily resulting from the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that ratable amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be replaced with annual tests for impairment and that intangible assets with finite lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
other income for year ended december  was million compared with income of million during the same period of the other income in is the result of a fair market value adjustment during the second quarter to a liability recorded in connection with the issuance of the warrants 
the warrants were issued along with our issuance of  shares of common stock on december  to the investors 
this liability is accounted for at fair market value and adjustments in future quarters could result in an increase to the liability and a corresponding charge in income 
we no longer hold shares of marketable equity securities  which made up the majority of the other income earned during interest expense decreased million to million during compared to the same period of the decrease is principally due to lower borrowing levels and decreased rates under the bank credit facility 
federal and state income tax benefit was million during compared with a tax provision of million for the same period in the effective income tax rate for was compared with in the same period of the effective tax rate during is affected by state tax benefits and by certain permanent differences including non deductible interest expense 
the effective income tax rate during was affected by non deductible goodwill amortization and interest expense 
net loss for and was  and  respectively 
vs 
net sales increased  or million to million  driven by increased sales of fiber bed mist eliminator products due to the successful implementation of a new marketing campaign focusing on nurturing relationships and increasing repeat orders 
the increase in sales was offset by a 
million decrease in sales from apc 
the market for apc s high temperature baghouse media continued to decline during compared to as of december   we sold the operating assets of apc as discussed previously 
the lower volume of orders from steel producers  foundries and automotive manufacturers  also affected sales as we experienced a decline of such orders during the second half of the year 
we concluded with a backlog of million 
gross profit excluding depreciation increased million to million in compared with million in gross profit as a percentage of revenues  was in compared with in gross margin was generally consistent with gross margin  except for apc  which decreased percentage points 
during the second quarter of  we expanded our design build capabilities into specialty piping for automotive finishing facilities 
in connection with this expansion  we entered into a contract that resulted in a contract loss of million 
accordingly  a charge was recorded to cost of sales for that amount 
we abandoned our plans to continue our expansion in this area 
gross profit margin was negatively impacted by about one percentage point because of this charge 
selling and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in from million in selling and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues for  was compared to in this reduction results from the cost savings identified in  the reversal of a reserve held in connection with a customer bankruptcy million  and the reversal of a million contingency 
as management anticipated  the cost reductions identified resulted in a favorable impact in depreciation and amortization increased by million to million in other income decreased by million to million during compared with million in the decrease was a result of reduced investment income from the company s holdings in marketable equity securities  which were sold in the first half of interest expense decreased by million to million during compared with million in principally due to lower borrowing levels and decreased rates under the bank credit facility 
federal and state income tax provision was million in compared with a tax benefit of million in the effective income tax rate in was 
the effective income tax rate was affected by non deductible goodwill amortization and interest expense particularly in years when income loss from operations before income taxes and minority interest is low in comparison to the non deductible items 
net loss for the year ended december  was million compared with a net loss of million in backlog our backlog consists of orders we have received for products and services we expect to ship and deliver within the next months 
our backlog  as of december  was million compared to million as of december  there can be no assurances that backlog will be replicated or increased or translated into higher revenues in the future 
the success of our business depends on a multitude of factors that are out of our control 
our operating results can be affected by the introduction of new products  new manufacturing technologies  rapid change of the demand for its products  decrease in average selling price over the life of the product as competition increases and our dependence on efforts of intermediaries to sell a portion of our product 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  compared with  at december  cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was million in compared with cash provided of million for the same period in total bank and related debt as of december  was million  a decrease of million  due to net repayments under bank credit facilities and payments made with respect to other notes payable 
unused credit availability at december   was million under our bank line of credit 
the senior secured credit facility was amended in march and november by reducing the minimum coverage requirements under several financial covenants through december   raising interest rates by  reducing scheduled principal payments in through and changing the maturity of the revolving line of credit to january from april in consideration for these amendments  additional fees of  were paid to the lenders 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
during december  as discussed below  we raised additional capital of million used to reduce the principal balance of the credit facility 
investing activities provided cash of million during compared with cash used of million for the same period in we received  from the sale of apc s assets  offset by capital expenditures for property and equipment  and leasehold improvements of million during  primarily for manufacturing equipment 
capital expenditures for property and equipment are anticipated to be in the range of million to million for and will be funded by cash from operations and our line of credit borrowings 
financing activities used cash of million during compared with million used by financing activities during the same period of million was used to pay down long term debt 
in the fourth quarter of  we received gross proceeds of million and issued  shares of common stock to the investors 
also  in the fourth quarter  green diamond and two non affiliated third parties exercised warrants to purchase  shares of ceco stock generating gross proceeds of million 
under the investors subscription agreement  we are required to issue shares of our common stock based on an earnings formula as set forth in the subscription agreement computed from fiscal year results 
as a result we will issue approximately  shares of common stock to the investors during in february  we accepted an offer  expiring september  to sell our cincinnati property 
this agreement can be cancelled at any time by the buyer up to the expiration date 
however  if this agreement is consummated  excess proceeds could be used to reduce our debt 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method only and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 on january   the company s intangible asset of  related to the workforce was reclassified to goodwill under the criteria of that standard and is no longer considered a separate intangible asset 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  requiring that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
implementation of sfas no 
is required for fiscal the adoption of this statement on january   did not have an effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which superceded sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the primary difference is that goodwill has been removed from the scope of sfas no 
it also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can clearly be distinguished operationally and for financial accounting purposes from the rest of the entity 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  the adoption did not have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued statement no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
among other amendments to previous pronouncements  which have already taken effect  a provision in the statement requiring certain gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be reclassified from extraordinary items  is effective january  the adoption of this statement on january   did not have an effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure which we must adopt in the statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method and  at this time  we do not anticipate making such voluntary change 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee 
however  the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  and had no effect on our financial statement disclosures for in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin consolidation of variable interest entities 
until this interpretation  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statement only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns 
fin applies to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which no enterprise obtains an interest in after that date 
a public entity with a variable interest in a variable interest entity created before february   shall apply the provisions of this interpretation other than the transition disclosure provisions in paragraph to that entity no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  the related disclosure requirements are effective immediately and had no effect on our financial statement disclosures for the impact of this interpretation will not have an effect on our financial condition or results of operations  as we do not have any variable interest entities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk risk management activities we are exposed to market risk including changes in interest and commodity prices 
we may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate exposures 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
generally  we enter into hedging relationships such that changes in the fair values of cash flows of items and transactions being hedged are expected to be offset by corresponding changes in the values of the derivatives 
interest rate management we may use interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of our total debt that is subject to variable interest rates 
our interest rate swap contract matured in and was not renewed 
under our interest rate swap contract  we agree to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest for a certain notional amount and receive in return an amount equal to a variable rate 
the notional amounts of the contract are not exchanged 
no other cash payments are made unless the contract is terminated before maturity 
these interest rate swap contracts are designated as cash flow hedges against changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with our interest payments on variable rate debt 
accordingly  when outstanding  they are reflected at fair value in our balance sheets and the related changes in fair value on these contracts  net of tax  are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our balance sheets 
to the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the interest payments being hedged  any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts are immediately recognized in our income statement 
the net effect of this accounting on our operating results is that interest expense on a portion of variable rate debt being hedged is generally recorded based on fixed interest rates 
this swap effectively changed the interest rate exposure of million of our floating rate debt to a weighted fixed rate of plus the applicable spread during the period in which the interest rate swap was outstanding 
the remaining amount of loans outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at the floating rates as described in note to the consolidated statements contained in item at december   there were no interest rate swap contracts outstanding 
at december   we had interest rate swap contracts on million notional amount of indebtedness 
as of december   we had 
million in unrealized losses resulting from the swap contracts 
the unrealized losses  net of tax  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our balance sheets 
although no collateral is held or exchanged for these contracts  interest rate swap contracts were entered into with a major financial institution in order to minimize our counterparty credit risk 
the following table presents information of all dollar denominated interest rate instruments

    average interest rate 
subordinated debt    average interest rate 
fixed rate debt average interest rate 
credit risk as part of our ongoing control procedures  we monitor concentrations of credit risk associated with financial institutions with which we conduct business 
credit risk is minimal as credit exposure is limited with any single high quality financial institution to avoid concentration 
we also monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business 
concentrations of credit associated with these trade receivables are considered minimal due to our geographically diverse customer base 
bad debts have not been significant 
we do not normally require collateral or other security to support credit sales
