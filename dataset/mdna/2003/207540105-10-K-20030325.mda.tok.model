item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general the company has only one subsidiary  the savings bank of manchester 
the bank s results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the bank also generates noninterest income primarily from fees charged on customers accounts and fees earned on activities such as investment services provided through a third party registered broker dealer 
gains on sales of securities are another source of noninterest income 
the bank s noninterest expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy expense  advertising and other operating expenses 
the bank s results of operations are also affected by general economic and competitive conditions  notably changes in market interest rates  government policies and regulations 
the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements at december  acquisition of first federal on august   the company completed its acquisition of first federal in a transaction accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities of first federal are reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheets at december  and december   and the results of operations of first federal since august  are included in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and december   as required by the purchase method of accounting 
significant accounting policies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant critical accounting policies and methods used by the company in preparation of financial statements 
general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to determining the allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment of securities  income taxes  impairments of intangible assets and pension and other postretirement benefits 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
allowance for loan losses 
the bank devotes significant attention to maintaining high loan quality through its underwriting standards  active servicing of loans and aggressive management of nonperforming assets 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level estimated by management to provide adequately for probable loan losses which are inherent in the loan portfolio 
probable loan losses are estimated based on a quarterly review of the loan portfolio  loss experience  specific problem loans  economic conditions and other pertinent factors 
in assessing risks inherent in the portfolio  management considers the risk of loss on nonperforming and classified loans including an analysis of collateral in each situation 
the bank s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses includes several key elements 
problem loans are identified and analyzed individually to detect specific losses including an analysis of estimated cash flows for impaired loans 
the loan portfolio is also segmented into pools of loans that are similar in type and risk characteristics ie  commercial  consumer and mortgage loans 

table of contents loss factors based on the bank s historical chargeoffs are applied using the bank s historical experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
additionally  the portfolio is segmented into pools based on internal risk ratings with estimated loss factors applied to each rating category 
other factors considered in determining probable loan losses are any changes in concentrations in the portfolio  trends in loan growth  the relationship and trends in recent years of recoveries as a percentage of prior chargeoffs and peer bank s loss experience 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary  and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
furthermore  while the bank believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the bank s loan portfolio  will not request the bank to increase its allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
material increases in the allowance for loan losses will adversely affect the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
other than temporary impairment of securities 
on a quarterly basis  the company reviews available for sale investment securities with unrealized depreciation for six consecutive months and other securities with unrealized depreciation on a judgmental basis to assess whether the decline in fair value is temporary or other than temporary 
the company judges whether the decline in value is from company specific events  industry developments  general economic conditions or other reasons 
once the estimated reasons for the decline are identified  further judgments are required as to whether those conditions are likely to reverse and  if so  whether that reversal is likely to result in a recovery of the fair value of the investment in the near term 
unrealized losses which are not expected to reverse in the near term are charged to operations 
income taxes 
the company has not provided for connecticut state income taxes since december  since it has a passive investment company pic as permitted by connecticut law 
the company believes it complies with the state pic requirements and that no state taxes are due from december  through december   however  the company has not been audited by the state for such periods 
if the state were to determine that the pic was not in compliance with statutory requirements a material amount of taxes could be due 
impairment of intangibles 
the company periodically evaluates intangible assets for potential impairment indicators and reviews goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis 
the company s judgements regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of acquired operations 
future events or changes in the fair value of the company s common stock could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that intangible assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
pension and other postretirement employee benefits 
the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the company s selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and in liquidity and capital resources below  and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect the company s recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while the company believes that the assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect pension and other postretirement obligations and the company s future expense

occasionally  the bank will also offer special competitive promotions to its customers to increase retention and promote deposit growth 
based upon the bank s historical experience with deposit retention  management believes that  although it is not possible to predict future terms and conditions upon renewal  a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the bank 
the bank has a non contributory defined benefit pension plan the pension plan covering substantially all employees 
the benefits are based on years of service and average compensation as defined in the pension plan 
the company s policy is to contribute annually the amount necessary to satisfy the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of our pension expense for the pension plan was million and  excluding  relating to the acquisition of first federal and  in special termination benefits for the years ended december  and  respectively  and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets of each year 
in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including their review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
we anticipate that our investment managers will continue to generate long term returns of at least 
we regularly review our asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments 
table of contents when considered appropriate 
we continue to believe that is a reasonable long term rate of return on our pension plan assets  despite the recent market downturn in which our pension plan assets had a loss of for the year ended december  we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions  including our expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust as necessary 
we base our determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a four year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a four year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from at december  to at december  based on an expected rate of return on our pension plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions  we estimate that our pension expense for the pension plan will approximate million  million and million in  and  respectively 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension plan 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets by from to would have increased our pension expense for by approximately  lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by would have increased our pension expense for by approximately  the value of our pension plan assets has decreased from million at december  to million at december  the investment performance returns and declining discount rates have further increased the underfunded status of our pension plan  net of benefit obligations  from million at december  to million at december  due to the recent reductions in the funded status of our pension plan  we believe that  based on our actuarial assumptions  we will be required to continue to make cash contributions to our pension plan 
during  the bank contributed million to the pension plan which was the minimum required and maximum deductible for the plan year 
during  the bank expects to contribute million to the pension plan which is the minimum required and maximum deductible for the plan year 
in the absence of significant changes  it is estimated that the minimum required contribution for the plan year will be between million and million 
the estimated increase in the minimum required contribution takes into account the phase in of investment losses experienced by the pension plan 
the bank also has supplemental retirement agreements with certain officers and outside directors 
the benefit obligation as of december  is million and is unfunded 
the bank must satisfy various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at december   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with a leverage capital level of million  or of average quarterly assets  which is above the required level of million  or  and total risk based capital of million  or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or 
the bank is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 

table of contents off balance sheet information the bank is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments included commitments to extend credit of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  and standby letters of credit of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
management of the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments 
these consolidated financial instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the financial instrument is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for existing loans 
management believes that the bank controls the credit risk of these financial instruments through credit approvals  lending limits  monitoring procedures and the receipt of collateral when deemed necessary 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments could expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
bank management evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank  upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include income producing commercial properties  accounts receivable  inventory and property  plant and equipment 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in existing loan facilities to customers 
the bank holds real estate and marketable securities as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary 
as of december   the company s contractual obligations by payment due period were in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total fhlb advances operating leases total contractual obligations impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this form k have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the bank s performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
the interpretation requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and also requires a guarantor to make new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making payments under the guarantee is remote 
in general  the 
table of contents interpretation applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying contract that is related to an asset  liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party

 consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires an enterprise to assess if consolidation is appropriate based upon its variable economic interests in variable interest entities vie s 
the initial determination of whether an entity is a vie shall be made on the date at which an enterprise becomes involved with the entity 
an entity is considered to be a vie if it lacks a sufficient amount of voting equity interests eg of total assets that are subject to the risk of loss or residual return of the entity 
an enterprise shall consolidate a vie if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur or both 
a direct or indirect ability to make decisions that significantly affect the results of the activities of a vie is a strong indication that an enterprise has one or both of the characteristics that would require consolidation of the vie 
interpretation no 
is effective for new vie s established subsequent to february  and must be adopted for existing vie s by july  the company does not invest in investment structures that require analysis under this interpretation and the adoption of interpretation no 
will not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the principal objectives of the bank s interest rate risk management are to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given its business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with its established policies 
the bank has an asset liability committee  responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which meets quarterly and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the executive committee of the board of directors and the board of directors 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the bank 
the bank manages interest rate risk by maintaining a high quality securities portfolio that provides adequate liquidity and flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from fluctuations in market interest rates  the overall maturity and duration of which is monitored in relation to the repricing of its loan portfolio  promoting lower cost liability accounts such as demand deposits and business repurchase accounts  and using advances from the fhlb to better structure maturities of its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the bank s market risk also includes equity price risk 
the bank s common stock and mutual fund portfolio had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of  at december  which are included  net of taxes  in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of the bank s capital 
if equity security prices decline due to unfavorable market conditions or other factors  the bank s capital would decrease 
the bank s investment policy authorizes it to be a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
all counter parties must be pre approved by the bank s executive committee and reported to its investment committee 
at december  the bank had no derivative instruments 

table of contents quantitative aspects of market risk the company analyzes its interest rate sensitivity position to manage the risk associated with interest rate movements through the use of balance sheet simulation 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the company s goal is to manage asset and liability positions so as to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income 
balance sheet simulations are completed quarterly and presented to the bank s asset liability committee 
the simulations provide an estimate of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under a range of assumptions 
the numerous assumptions used in the simulation process are reviewed by the asset liability committee on a quarterly basis 
changes to these assumptions can significantly effect the results of the balance sheet simulation 
the simulation incorporates assumptions regarding potential delays in the repricing of certain assets and liabilities when market rates change and changes in spreads between different market rates 
the simulation analysis incorporates management s current assessment of the risk that pricing margins will change adversely over time due to competition or other factors 
simulation analysis is only an estimate of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time 
the company continually reviews the potential effect changes in interest rates could have on the repayment of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities 
the table below sets forth an approximation of the company s exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next twelve and twenty four month periods using balance sheet simulation 
the simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on the company s balance sheet simulation 
because of the large percentage of loans  collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities held by the company  rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of the company s earning assets  which in turn effect the company s rate sensitivity position 
when open market interest rates rise  prepayments tend to slow 
when open market interest rates fall  prepayments tend to rise 
the company s asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow  and vice versa 
while the bank believes such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security  collateralized mortgage obligation and loan repayment activity 
percentage change in estimated net interest income over months months basis point increase in rates basis point decrease in rates the two hundred basis point change in rates in the above table is assumed to occur evenly over the next twelve months 
based on the scenario above  net income would be adversely affected within the bank s internal guidelines in both the twelve and twenty four month periods in a declining rate environment 
in a rising rate environment net income would be adversely affected over the next twelve months and positively affected over a twenty four month period 
for each percentage point change in net interest income  the effect on net income would be  assuming a tax rate
