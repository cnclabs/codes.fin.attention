item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our revenue is derived from the sale of tickets for entrance to our parks approximately  and in  and  respectively and the sale of food  merchandise  games and attractions inside our parks  as well as sponsorship and other income approximately  and in  and  respectively 
our principal costs of operations include salaries and wages  employee benefits  advertising  outside services  maintenance  utilities and insurance 
our expenses are relatively fixed 
costs for full time employees  maintenance  utilities  advertising and insurance do not vary significantly with attendance  thereby providing us with a significant degree of operating leverage as attendance increases and fixed costs per visitor decrease 
the comparability of our results between periods is impacted by the timing of the acquisitions we make 
results of operations for include the results of jazzland now six flags new orleans from its acquisition date of august  results of operations for include the results of the former sea world of ohio from february   and of la ronde from may   their respective acquisition dates 
results of operations for include the results of enchanted village and wild waves from december  its acquisition date 
we believe that opportunities exist to acquire additional theme parks 
we also intend to continue the addition of the rides and attractions and overall improvement of our parks to maintain and enhance their appeal  although the level of our expenditure in this respect is expected to be lower in the next several years than had previously been the case 
we believe this strategy has contributed to increased attendance  lengths of stay and in park spending and  therefore  profitability 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases in which we determine that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  we depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over the revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
a reduction in the useful life of the property and equipment utilized in the operations of our theme park partnerships similarly increases depreciation expense related to such investments and thereby reduce equity in operations of theme parks 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as differing depreciation periods for our property and equipment and deferred revenue  for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets principally net operating loss carryforwards will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill through december   we had assessed the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we considered important which could have triggered an impairment review included the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
through that date  when we determined that the carrying value of long lived assets and related goodwill may not have been recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measured any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
long lived assets amounted to  million including goodwill and other intangible assets of  million as of december  long lived assets included property and equipment  investment in the park partnerships and intangible assets 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  as of january   we ceased amortizing approximately billion of goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of goodwill amortization including equity method goodwill  exclusive of tax effect on these amounts during and would have recorded a comparable amount of amortization during had sfas no 
been in effect during and  the net loss applicable to common stock for the year would have decreased to million or per basic share and million or per basic share  respectively 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and are required to perform an annual impairment review thereafter 
to accomplish this  we identified our reporting units north america and europe and determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  we then determined the fair value of each reporting unit  compared it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit and compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which were measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
based on the foregoing  we determined that million of goodwill associated with our european reporting unit was impaired and  during  we recognized a transitional impairment loss in that amount as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statements of operations 
the loss was retroactively recorded in the first quarter of  which was restated for this loss  in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
our unamortized goodwill after impairment is  million

results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
revenue in totaled  million compared to  million for  representing a decrease 
this decrease reflects a decrease in attendance at the consolidated parks 
the attendance shortfall was most pronounced at three parks  reflecting the impact of the difficult economy  particularly in group outings business  and other market specific performance issues 
this attendance shortfall was offset in part by a increase in total per capita spending  reflecting growth both in admission per capita and in park and other revenue per capita 
excluding revenues at the former jazzland now six flags new orleans acquired on august   revenues in would have decreased million or 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for increased million compared to expenses for the increase resulted from the inclusion for the entire year of the former sea world of ohio  which was acquired in february  and la ronde  acquired in may  as well as the inclusion in of expenses at jazzland subsequent to the august  acquisition of that park 
the sea world facility was combined with our adjacent six flags park in after its acquisition 
assuming that the sea world and la ronde parks had been owned for the entire year and excluding expenses at jazzland for  operating expenses in would have decreased million as compared to the pro forma prior year 
selling  general and administrative  noncash compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased million compared to comparable expenses for assuming that the sea world and la ronde parks had been owned for the entire year and excluding expenses at jazzland for  selling  general and administrative expenses in would have decreased million as compared to the pro forma prior year 
noncash compensation expense was million greater than the prior year  reflecting the increased amortization associated with prior year restricted stock awards  which have now been fully amortized  and director stock options 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold in decreased million compared to costs for  reflecting the slight decrease in theme park food  merchandise and other revenue in as a percentage of theme park food  merchandise and other revenue  costs of products sold were approximately and  respectively  in and depreciation and amortization  interest expense  net of interest income  other income expense 
depreciation and amortization expense for decreased million compared to the decrease compared to the level was attributable to the elimination of amortization of goodwill in see critical accounting issues valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill and note to notes to consolidated financial statements  offset in part by a million increase in depreciation expense in interest expense  net increased million compared to the increase compared to interest expense  net for resulted primarily from a decrease in in interest income compared to the prior year as well as the short term effects of our february refinancing of million of debt with the proceeds of our issuance of million principal amount of senior notes due because the related redemption of the refinanced notes was not effected until april   interest expense on these notes continued to accrue through the end of the first quarter of other expense increased million in compared to the prior year 
equity in operations of theme parks 
equity in operations of theme park partnerships reflects our share of the income or loss of six flags over texas we have a effective ownership and six flags over georgia  including white water atlanta we have a effective ownership  and the lease of six flags marine world 
our minority investment in warner bros 
movie world madrid is accounted for under the cost method and did not affect equity in operations in during  equity in operations of theme parks decreased million compared to  primarily as a result of reduced attendance and revenues at two of these parks in income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit was million for compared to a million benefit for prior to  our effective tax rate was adversely affected from the result of permanent differences associated with goodwill amortization for financial purposes  the lesser amount of amortization that is deductible for tax purposes and from nondeductible compensation expense associated with conditional stock options and restricted stock grants 
during  our effective tax rate was adversely impacted by such nondeductible compensation expense and the limited recognition of tax benefits from our european operations 
at december   we estimated that we had approximately  million of net operating losses nols carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
the nols are subject to review and potential disallowance by the internal revenue service upon audit of our federal income tax returns and those of our subsidiaries 
in addition  the use of such nols is subject to limitations on the amount of taxable income that can be offset with such nols 
some of such nols also are subject to a limitation as to which of the subsidiaries income such nols are permitted to offset 
although no assurance can be given as to the timing or amount of the availability of such nols to us and our subsidiaries  we anticipate that it is more likely than not that virtually all of the nols will be utilized prior to their expiration 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue in totaled  million compared to  million for this increase resulted from the inclusion of the performance of three parks acquired after the season 
one of the acquired parks  the former sea world of ohio  operated in together with our previously owned adjacent facility as a single gate  six flags worlds of adventure 
excluding the results of the acquired parks in montreal and seattle and excluding the increase in revenues at the combined ohio facility  revenues in on a constant currency basis decreased approximately over the prior year 
domestic revenues from consolidated parks in increased by over and increased by on a same park basis 
growth in domestic revenues was constrained by a lower than expected increase in per capita spending reflecting the impact of difficult economic conditions per capita spending grew by  and by a sharp drop off in performance in the weekend operations immediately following the september  terrorist activities 
international park revenues were down approximately from on a same park basis in constant currencies  reflecting particularly the performance of our european parks 
the performance of those parks was adversely affected by a number of factors  including difficult economic conditions and challenging weather in a number of markets 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for increased million compared to expenses for excluding the acquired parks in montreal and seattle and excluding the increase in expenses at the combined ohio facility  operating expenses in decreased million or as compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative  noncash compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased million compared to comparable expenses for excluding the acquired parks in montreal and seattle and excluding the increase in expenses at the combined ohio facility  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or as compared to the prior year  primarily due to increases in advertising and insurance expenses and increased real estate and other taxes 
noncash compensation expense was million less than the prior year period  reflecting the decreased amortization associated with prior year restricted stock awards and conditional option grants 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold in decreased million compared to costs for  and decreased million excluding the acquired parks in montreal and seattle and excluding the increases in expenses at the combined ohio facility 
as a percentage of theme park food  merchandise and other revenue  costs of products sold in were  compared to in the prior year period  reflecting in part our increased use of games and other concession arrangements in which we receive revenues from third party operators without incurring the associated costs  as well as increased efficiencies 
depreciation and amortization  interest expense  net of interest income  other income expense 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased million compared to the increase compared to the prior year level was attributable to additional expense associated with the acquired parks  including the former sea world of ohio and our on going capital program 
interest expense  net decreased million compared to the decrease compared to interest expense  net for the prior year resulted from lower average interest rates and lower average debt balances 
other expense decreased in by million compared to due to a reduced level of asset dispositions in equity in operations of theme parks 
equity in operations of theme parks reflects our share of the income or loss of six flags over texas we have a effective ownership and six flags over georgia  including white water atlanta we have a effective ownership  and the lease of six flags marine world 
during  equity in operations of theme parks increased million compared to  primarily as a result of improved attendance and revenue performance at six flags over texas and six flags marine world over the prior year 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit was million for compared to a million expense for during  our effective tax rate was adversely affected from the result of permanent differences associated with goodwill amortization for financial purposes  the lesser amount of amortization that is deductible for tax purposes and from nondeductible compensation expense associated with conditional stock options and restricted stock grants 
additionally during  we reorganized our european organizational structure which reduced the effective tax rate in europe 
liquidity  capital commitments and resources at december   our total debt aggregated  million  of which approximately million was scheduled to mature prior to december  based on interest rates at december  for floating rate debt and after giving effect to the interest rate swaps described below  annual cash interest payments for on total debt at december  will aggregate approximately million 
in addition  annual dividend payments on our outstanding preferred stock are million  payable at our option in cash or shares of common stock 
our debt at december  included  million of fixed rate senior notes  with staggered maturities ranging from to  million under our credit facility and million of other indebtedness 
our credit facility includes a million term loan all of which was outstanding at december   a million multicurrency reducing revolver facility none outstanding at that date and a million working capital revolver million outstanding at that date 
the working capital facility must be repaid in full for consecutive days during each year and terminates on june  the multicurrency reducing revolving credit facility  which permits optional prepayments and reborrowings  requires quarterly mandatory reductions in the initial commitment together with repayments  to the extent that the outstanding borrowings thereunder would exceed the reduced commitment of of the committed amount thereof commencing on december   commencing on march   commencing on march  and commencing on march  and this facility terminates on june  the term loan facility requires quarterly repayments of of the outstanding amount thereof commencing on september  and commencing on september  the term loan matures on june  under the credit facility  the maturity of the term loan will be shortened to various dates between december  and december  if prior to such dates i we do not repay or refinance three issues of public debt or ii our outstanding preferred stock is not converted or redeemed 
all of our outstanding preferred stock million liquidation preference must be redeemed on august  to the extent not previously converted into common stock 
see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our indebtedness and preferred stock 
at december   we had approximately million of unrestricted cash  million of restricted cash available to fund obligations relating to the partnership parks described below and million available under our credit facility 
due to the seasonal nature of our business  we are largely dependent upon our million working capital revolving credit portion of our credit agreement in order to fund off season expenses 
our ability to borrow under the working capital revolver is dependent upon compliance with certain conditions  including financial ratios and the absence of any material adverse change 
we are currently in compliance with all of these conditions 
if we were to become unable to borrow under the facility  we would likely be unable to pay in full our off season obligations 
the working capital facility expires in june the terms and availability of our credit facility and other indebtedness would not be affected by a change in the ratings issued by rating agencies in respect of our indebtedness 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
net cash used in investing activities in totaled million  consisting primarily of capital expenditures for the and seasons  investments in movie world madrid and other theme park partnerships and the cash portion of the purchase of six flags new orleans 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  representing the redemption of two public debt issuances on april   open market purchases of certain of our public debt and cash dividends paid on our preferred stock  offset by the proceeds of the debt offering 
as more fully described in business six flags over georgia and six flags white water atlanta and six flags over texas and six flags hurricane harbor  in connection with our acquisition of the former six flags  we guaranteed certain obligations relating to six flags over georgia and six flags over texas 
these obligations continue until  in the case of the georgia park and  in the case of the texas park 
among such obligations are i minimum annual distributions including rent of approximately million in subject to cost of living adjustments in subsequent years to partners in these two partnerships parks of which we will be entitled to receive in approximately million based on our present ownership of of the georgia partnership and of the texas partnership  ii minimum capital expenditures at each park during rolling five year periods based generally on of park revenues  and iii an annual offer to purchase a maximum number of per year accumulating to the extent not purchased in any given year of limited partnership units at specified prices 
we plan to make approximately million of capital expenditures at these parks for the season  an amount in excess of the minimum required expenditure 
because we have not been required since to purchase a material amount of units  our maximum unit purchase obligation for both parks in is an aggregate of approximately million  representing approximately of the outstanding units of the georgia park and of the outstanding units of the texas park 
the annual unit purchase obligation without taking into account accumulation from prior years aggregates approximately million for both parks based on current purchase prices 
as we purchase additional units  we are entitled to a proportionate increase in our share of the minimum annual distributions 
cash flows from operations at these partnership parks will be used to satisfy the annual distribution and capital expenditure requirements  before any funds are required from us 
the two partnerships generated approximately million of aggregate ebitda during in addition  we had million in a dedicated escrow account at december  classified as a restricted use investment available to fund these obligations and the obligation to purchase units 
the escrow arrangement terminates on april  at december   we had total loans outstanding of million to the partnerships that own these parks  primarily to fund the acquisition of six flags white water atlanta and to make capital improvements  which loans are included in our investment in theme parks 
by virtue of its acting as the managing general partner of the partnerships that own six flags over texas and six flags over georgia  one of our subsidiaries is legally liable for the obligations of each of those parks  including their indebtedness 
because we are required to account for our interests in those parks by the equity method of accounting  the obligations of the partnerships are not reflected as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   these partnerships had outstanding million of third party indebtedness including million of borrowings under working capital revolving facilities at that date  of which million including the working capital facilities borrowings matures prior to december  we expect that cash flow from operations at each of the partnership parks will be adequate to satisfy its debt obligations 
our previous property insurance policies expired in september and our liability insurance policies expired in november the replacement insurance policies we obtained do not cover risks to property related to terrorist activities which were not excluded from the prior property insurance policies  require higher premiums and have larger self insurance retentions than the previous policies 
the current policies expire in september and november due in large part to the continuing effects of the september  terrorist attack upon the insurance industry  we cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage  the level of any self insurance retention applicable thereto  the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks  such as terrorism 
set forth below is certain information regarding our debt  preferred stock and lease obligations at december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligation and beyond total long term debt      piers   real estate and operating leases     total      in addition to the debt  preferred stock and lease obligations set forth above and our commitments to the partnerships that own six flags over texas and six flags over georgia discussed above  our contractual commitments include commitments for license fees to warner bros 
and commitments relating to capital expenditures 
license fees to warner bros 
for our domestic parks aggregate million annually through after that season  the license fee is payable based upon the number of domestic parks utilizing the licensed characters 
the license fee relating to our international parks is based on percentages of the revenues of the international parks utilizing the characters 
for  license fees for our international parks aggregated million 
we have prepaid approximately million of the international license fees 
although we are contractually committed to make specified levels of capital expenditures at selected parks for the next several years  the vast majority of our capital expenditures in and beyond will be made on a discretionary basis 
we plan on spending approximately million on capital expenditures for the season  including the expenditures at the partnership parks 
the degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our liquidity 
our liquidity could also be adversely affected by unfavorable weather  accidents or the occurrence of an event or condition  including negative publicity or significant local competitive events  that significantly reduces paid attendance and  therefore  revenue at any of our theme parks 
we believe that  based on historical and anticipated operating results  cash flows from operations  available cash and available amounts under the credit agreement will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs  including anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  scheduled debt and preferred stock requirements and obligations under arrangements relating to the partnership parks  for at least the next several years 
we expect to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt on or prior to maturity or to seek additional financing 
in addition  our anticipated cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of certain of the risks described in business risk factors 
in that case  we would need to seek additional financing 
includes capital lease obligations 
payments shown at principal amount 
payments shown do not include interest payments or principal payments on our working capital revolver  borrowings under which aggregated million at december  the million working capital revolver must be repaid in full for consecutive days in each year 
obligations not denominated in us dollars have been converted based on the exchange rates existing on december  amount shown excludes annual dividends of approximately million  which we are permitted to pay in either cash or common stock 
the amount shown for the cash redemption obligations assumes no conversion of piers prior thereto 
assumes for lease payments based on a percentage of revenues  future payments at revenue levels 
also does not give effect to cost of living adjustments 
obligations not denominated in us dollars have been converted based on the exchange rates existing on december  we may from time to time seek to retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on the prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
market risks and sensitivity analyses like other global companies  we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the objective of our financial risk management is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operations  cash flows and equity 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we are party to three interest rate swap agreements that for the term of the applicable agreements ranging from march to june effectively convert our million term loan into a fixed rate obligation 
our term loan borrowings bear interest at above the libor rate 
our interest rate swap agreements effectively lock in the libor component at rates ranging from to and average until march   and then to and average 
the counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions  which minimizes the credit risk 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis the following analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value  operations and cash flows of our market risk financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates as if these changes occurred at december  the range of changes chosen for this analysis reflect our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate assumptions 
these forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of these changes in interest and exchange rates 
at december   we had debt totaling  million  of which  million represents fixed rate debt and the balance represents floating rate debt 
of the floating rate debt  million principal amount is subject to interest rate swap agreements 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact book value  operations or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future operations and cash flows  assuming other factors remain constant 
additionally  increases and decreases in interest rates impact the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
a decrease in thirty and ninety day libor interest rates increases the fair value liability of the interest rate swap agreements 
however  over the term of the interest rate swap agreements  the economic effect of changes in interest rates is fixed as we will pay a fixed amount and are not subject to changes in interest rates 
assuming other variables remain constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements and assuming an average annual balance on our working capital revolver  the pre tax operations and cash flows impact resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be less than million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued statement no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the statement updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
as it relates to us  the statement eliminates the extraordinary loss classification on early debt extinguishments 
instead  the premiums and other costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt would be reflected in pre tax results similar to other debt related expenses  such as interest expense and amortization of issuance costs 
the statement became effective on january  in our case 
upon adoption  we will reclassify the extraordinary losses incurred in prior periods million  net of tax benefit of million in and million  net of tax benefit of million in as pretax items 
the adoption of this statement did not modify or adjust net loss for any period and not impact our compliance with various debt covenants

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december  and are included in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and are included in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of statement no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
interpretation no 
requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if the company has a variable interest or combination of variable interests that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
a direct or indirect ability to make decisions that significantly affect the results of the activities of a variable interest entity is a strong indication that a company has one or both of the characteristics that would require consolidation of the variable interest entity 
interpretation no 
also requires additional disclosures regarding variable interest entities 
the new interpretation is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january   and is effective in the first interim or annual period beginning after june   for variable interest entities in which a company holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we are currently evaluating the provisions of the interpretation 
we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations
