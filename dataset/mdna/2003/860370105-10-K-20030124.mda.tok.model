item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  customer payments related to these contracts are generally placed in trust funds and invested or are used to purchase insurance policies to cover the cost of the future delivery of products and services 
when the service or merchandise is delivered  we realize the full contract amount plus all accumulated trust earnings associated with that contract or the buildup in the face value of the insurance contract  generally offsetting increases in our costs due to inflation 
we estimate that as of october   the future value of our preneed backlog including estimated earnings on funds held in trust and build up in the face value of insurance contracts  in each case at projected rates represented approximately billion to billion of revenue to be recognized in the future as these prepaid products and services are delivered  calculated as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in item trust funds and escrow accounts 
we maintain three types of trust funds and escrow accounts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services and perpetual care 
for further discussion of these trust funds and escrow accounts  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in item as of october   the market value of our preneed funeral merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts totaled approximately million  the market value of our preneed cemetery merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts totaled approximately million  and the market value of our perpetual care trust funds totaled approximately million 
we believe that the balances in our trust funds and escrow accounts  along with insurance proceeds  installment payments due under contracts and future earnings on the balances  will be sufficient to cover our estimated cost of providing the related preneed services and products in the future see cautionary statements included in item 
generally  our wholly owned subsidiary  investors trust  inc iti  a texas corporation with trust powers  serves as investment advisor on our investment portfolio and our prearranged funeral  merchandise and perpetual care trust funds and escrow accounts 
iti provides investment advisory services exclusively to us 
iti is registered with the securities and exchange commission under the investment advisers act of as of october   iti had approximately million in assets under management 
lawrence b 
hawkins  one of our executive officers and a professional investment manager  serves as president of iti 
iti operates with the assistance of third party professional financial consultants pursuant to a formal investment policy established by the investment committee of our board of directors 
the policy emphasizes conservation  diversification and preservation of principal while seeking appropriate levels of current income and capital appreciation 
management 
we have an experienced management team  many of whom joined us through acquisitions 
our management structure is designed to allow local funeral home directors and cemetery managers substantial flexibility in deciding how their businesses will be managed and how their products and services will be priced and merchandised 
at the same time  financial and strategic goals are established by management at the corporate level 
we provide business support services primarily through our shared services center  which opened in and provides centralized and standardized accounting  management reporting  payroll  contract processing  accounts receivable collection and other services for all of our facilities 
currently  we are divided into four operating divisions in the united states  each of which is managed by a division president and chief financial officer 
these divisions are further divided into regions  each of which is managed by a regional chief operating officer 
we also have a corporate division  which manages our corporate services  accounting and financial operations and strategic planning 
early in fiscal year  we formed a sales and marketing division 
table of contents to centralize responsibility for sales teams in all operating divisions and to allow for more comprehensive training and sharing of information 
from time to time  we may increase  reduce or realign our divisions and regions 
foreign operations 
in fiscal year  we began to sell our foreign operations as part of our strategy to reduce debt and focus on our core businesses 
during fiscal year  we sold our mexican  australian  new zealand  belgian and dutch operations comprised of funeral homes and cemeteries 
during fiscal year  we sold our operations in spain  portugal  france  canada and argentina  which consisted of funeral homes and cemeteries 
for fiscal year  our revenues from foreign operations were million  or percent of total revenues  our gross profit from foreign operations was million  or percent of total gross profit  and our ebitda defined as earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization from foreign operations was million  or percent of total ebitda 
the reduction in operating earnings from the sale of these foreign operations from fiscal year to forecasted operating earnings for fiscal year is expected to be substantially offset by interest expense savings of approximately million resulting from the use of proceeds from these sales to reduce our average debt balance 
after adjusting for interest expense savings and income taxes  the earnings contribution to fiscal year earnings per share from the foreign businesses was approximately per diluted share 
financial information about industry and geographic segments 
for financial information about our industry and geographic segments for fiscal years  and  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item competition our funeral home and cemetery operations generally face intense competition in local markets that typically are served by numerous funeral home and cemetery firms 
we also compete with monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and other non traditional providers of limited services or products 
market share is largely a function of goodwill  family heritage and tradition  although competitive pricing  professional service and attractive  well maintained and conveniently located facilities are also important 
because of the significant role of goodwill and tradition  market share increases are usually gained over a long period of time 
extensive marketing through media advertising  direct mailings and personal sales calls has increased in recent years  especially with respect to the sales of preneed funeral services 
traditional cemetery and funeral service operators face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the united states 
additional information about the trend towards cremation and our strategies to address this can be found above under the headings the death care industry  competitive strengths and business strategy 
regulation our funeral home operations are regulated by the federal trade commission the ftc under the ftc s trade regulation rule on funeral industry practices  cfr part the funeral rule  which went into effect on april   and was revised effective july  the ftc is reviewing the funeral rule and has conducted hearings to receive input from industry and consumer groups 
at this time  the ftc has not issued any proposed changes to the regulation 
the funeral rule defines certain acts or practices as unfair or deceptive and contains certain requirements to prevent these acts or practices 
the preventive measures require a funeral provider to give consumers accurate  itemized price information and various other disclosures about funeral goods and services and prohibit a funeral provider from misrepresenting legal  crematory and cemetery requirements  embalming for a fee without permission  requiring the purchase of a casket for direct cremation  and requiring consumers to buy certain funeral goods or services as a condition for furnishing other funeral goods or services 
in november  senator christopher dodd d ct introduced the federal death care inspection and disclosure act the bill to enact and extend certain requirements of the funeral rule  to create a private right of action and 
table of contents statutory minimum damages for enforcement in addition to the ftc s enforcement rights  to regulate preneed sales and contracts and to provide grants to states for regulatory enforcement 
congressman mark foley r fl introduced similar legislation in the house of representatives 
senator dodd s bill would create the position of coordinator of funeral  burial and disposition services within the department of health and human services 
the coordinator would make a survey of the existing state regulatory laws and formulate standards for the registration  inspection and the monitoring of the handling and disposition of human remains 
the coordinator would be required to report to congress within eight months after the enactment of the legislation 
the bill would also provide for federal grants to state agencies responsible for the registration  inspection and monitoring of death care providers 
within days of enactment of the bill  the coordinator would be required to establish minimum standards  including registration of death care facilities  physical inspections  recordkeeping  licensing and resolution of consumer complaints among other matters 
the bill would also require certain disclosures with respect to the identity of the service or merchandise provider  itemized prices  the necessity of certain merchandise and services under state law  the identity of state agencies designated to receive consumer complaints and the lack of effectiveness of certain containers to preserve human remains  among other matters 
the bill would require that each consumer be provided with an itemized statement of funeral goods and services 
the disclosures would be required to be made by any seller of funeral  burial or disposition goods or services offered or purchased  including casket sellers  funeral homes  cemeteries and crematories 
the bill would prohibit certain deceptive trade practices under the federal trade commission act including i misrepresentations as to the requirements of federal  state or local law or the requirements of a cemetery with respect to the necessity of purchasing certain funeral goods or services  ii conditioning the provision of funeral goods and services upon the purchase of other goods and services or the payment of fees not described in the bill  iii providing unauthorized services  iv making certain representations about the cost of cash advance items  if not true  and failing to disclose that the consumer has the right to arrange for the purchase of the cash advance item himself or herself  and v failing to comply with specified prepaid contract requirements  among other practices 
the bill would also establish recordkeeping requirements for providers of death care goods and services 
if enacted  the bill would prohibit unsolicited telephone offers to sell funeral goods and services and door to door direct offers for such sales 
it would require that a funeral provider state its affiliation with a publicly traded company 
it would establish requirements for prepaid contracts including i a statement of the goods and services to be delivered  ii a statement that the prices set forth are not guaranteed or that additional payment may be required in the future  when the prices of merchandise and services are not guaranteed  iii a statement of what happens if merchandise is not available at the time of delivery  iv an explanation of how the purchaser s funds are being protected to assure the seller s performance of the prepaid contract  v provisions for cancellation or transfer of the contract with no loss of benefits paid by the purchaser along with accrued interest  and vi limitations on provisions regarding the irrevocability of such contracts  among other things 
it also mandates the establishment of certain consumer disclosures in prepaid contracts 
the bill also provides that its provisions will not be effective in a state where i the state s agency so requests  ii there are already in place state requirements applicable to the provision or regulation  and iii the state requirement  enforcement and administration affords to the consumer an overall level of protection that is equal to or exceeds the level of protection afforded by the ftc s enforcement of such provisions or regulations 
our operations are also subject to extensive regulation  supervision and licensing under numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations 
for example  state laws impose licensing requirements for funeral homes and funeral directors and regulate preneed sales 
our embalming facilities are subject to stringent environmental and health regulations 
we have a department that monitors compliance  and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the funeral rule and all such laws and regulations 
federal  state and local legislative bodies and regulatory agencies 
table of contents frequently propose new laws and regulations  some of which  such as the bill proposed by senator dodd  could have a material effect on our operations and on the death care industry in general 
we cannot predict the outcome of any proposed legislation or regulation or the effect that any such legislation or regulation might have on us 
employees we employ approximately  persons  and we believe that we maintain a good relationship with our employees 
approximately of our employees are represented by labor unions or collective bargaining units 
item properties as of october   approximately percent of our funeral home locations were owned by our subsidiaries  and approximately percent were held under operating leases 
the leased properties have terms ranging from to years  except for six leases that expire between and generally  we have a right of first refusal and an option to purchase the leased premises 
an aggregate of million of our term notes are secured by mortgages on some of our funeral homes  these notes were either assumed by us upon our acquisition of the property or represent seller financing for the acquired property 
as of october   we owned cemeteries covering a total of approximately  acres 
approximately percent of the total acreage is available for future development 
our corporate headquarters occupy approximately  square feet of leased office space in a building in suburban new orleans 
in addition  we own a  square foot building in suburban new orleans that we use for our shared services center  human resources  communications  internal audit and information systems departments 
as of october   we had sold all of our foreign operations 
see the section above entitled operations foreign operations 
item legal proceedings we and certain of our subsidiaries are party to a number of legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we carry insurance with coverages and coverage limits that we believe to be adequate 
although we give no assurance that this insurance is sufficient to protect us against all contingencies  we believe that our insurance protection is reasonable in view of the nature and scope of our operations

as of january   we operated funeral homes and cemeteries in states within the united states and in puerto rico 
as described in operations  we sell cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis 
our revenues in each period are derived primarily from at need sales  preneed sales delivered out of our backlog during the period including the accumulated trust fund earnings or buildup in the face value of insurance contracts related to these preneed deliveries  preneed cemetery property sales and other items such as perpetual care earnings and finance charges 
preneed sales as described in competitive strengths expertise in preneed sales  strong backlog and business strategy maintain backlog through preneed marketing  we consider maintaining our preneed backlog through preneed marketing and sales to be an integral part of our long term business strategy 
our primary objective is to produce preneed sales levels sufficient to balance our cash investment with our goal of maintaining a sustainable and predictable level of growth in our preneed backlog 
our current goal is to make four preneed funeral sales for every three we deliver 
revenue from preneed sales delivered from our backlog includes accumulated realized trust fund earnings consisting of dividends  interest and net realized capital gains or buildup in the face value of insurance contracts related to these deliveries 
additionally  we receive revenue from perpetual care earnings  which is used to fund maintenance of our cemetery grounds 
income from funds  especially those invested partially in common stock  can be materially affected by prevailing interest rates and the performance of the stock market 
in managing trust and escrow funds  which include significant investments in common stock  we have historically sought  and from through were successful in achieving  an overall annual return of approximately to percent  which was well 
table of contents in excess of the inflation rate over that period of time 
we did not achieve that goal in fiscal years  or in fiscal years  and  our overall realized domestic returns were percent  percent and percent  respectively  which still exceeded the inflation rates in those years 
our goal for fiscal year is to achieve an overall return of percent  and our long term goal is to return to an to percent return 
no assurance can be given  however  that we will be successful in achieving any particular return 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  preneed funeral and preneed cemetery merchandise trust funds and escrow accounts had net unrealized depreciation of million and million  respectively  as of october  unrealized gains and losses in the funeral trust funds and cemetery merchandise trust funds have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow  unless the fair market value of the funds were to decline below the estimated costs to deliver the underlying products and services 
if that were to occur  we would record a charge to earnings to record the expected loss currently 
over time  gains and losses realized in the funds are allocated to underlying preneed contracts and affect the amount of trust fund earnings to be recognized when we deliver the underlying product or service 
accordingly  if current market conditions do not improve  the funds may eventually realize losses and our revenues  margins  earnings and cash flow would be negatively affected by the reduced revenue when we deliver the underlying products and services 
we estimate that with approximately percent to percent annual returns in the funds over the estimated lives of the associated preneed contracts  our trust and escrow funds would recover the net unrealized depreciation currently in the funds by the time the underlying products and services are delivered 
we estimate that as of october  the future value of our preneed backlog represented between billion and billion of revenue to be recognized in the future as these prepaid products and services are delivered 
this represents the face value of the backlog plus the earnings that are projected on the funds held in trust and a build up in the face value of insurance contracts 
it assumes no future preneed sales and assumes maturities each year consistent with our experience  with the majority of existing contracts maturing over the next years 
as of october   the value of the preneed backlog  excluding any future earnings on the funds held in trust and any build up in the face value of insurance contracts  but including earnings and losses realized to date on the funds held in trust  was approximately billion 
preneed property  products and services are typically sold on an installment basis with terms of approximately three to five years 
in fiscal year  we changed the terms and conditions of our preneed sales contracts and commissions  and moderated our preneed sales activities  in order to enhance our cash flow 
these changes are described in more detail under the heading  results of operations year ended october  compared to year ended october  cemetery segment below 
with respect to the sale of cemetery property  whether preneed or at need  we are generally required by state law to place into a perpetual care trust  a portion  usually percent  of the proceeds we receive in order to fund maintenance of the cemetery grounds 
as payments are received  we generally fund the perpetual care trust in the same proportion as the payment bears to the contract amount  for example  if we receive percent of the contract price  we place in trust percent of the total amount to be placed in trust for that contract 
we withdraw realized earnings  including net realized capital gains in some jurisdictions  on these funds to use towards the maintenance of our cemeteries  but principal must generally be held in the trust in perpetuity 
with respect to the preneed sale of cemetery and funeral products and services  state laws generally require either a portion of the installment payments received be placed into a trust fund or the use of an insurance policy underwritten by an insurance company to provide funds to cover the costs of delivering funeral products and services in the future 
with respect to the preneed sale of cemetery merchandise  we are generally required to place in trust to percent of each installment received 
with respect to the preneed sale of funeral and cemetery services  we are generally required to place in trust to percent of each installment received 
the sale of caskets is treated in some jurisdictions in the same manner as the sale of cemetery merchandise and in some jurisdictions in the same manner as the sale of funeral services for these purposes 
when insurance is used  we apply customer payments to pay premiums 
table of contents on the insurance policies 
we typically act as agent for the insurance company and earn a commission 
generally  we can withdraw the principal of and earnings on the funds placed in trust only at the time that the related products and services are delivered 
implementation of staff accounting bulletin no 
effective november   we implemented staff accounting bulletin no

 revenue recognition in financial statements  which resulted in changing our methods of accounting for preneed sales activities 
the effect of the change in accounting principles is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a description of our current accounting for preneed sales and trust and escrow account earnings after implementation of sab no 
follows 
summary of current accounting for preneed sales we sell prearranged funeral services and preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise under contracts that provide for delivery of the services and merchandise at the time of death 
revenue from preneed sales of services and merchandise is deferred until the period in which the service is performed and the merchandise is delivered 
on the balance sheet  the full contract amount is included in prearranged deferred revenue  net liability 
the corresponding receivable due from the customer is reflected in prearranged receivables  net asset  and the corresponding cash received from the customer is reflected part in prearranged receivables for the portion placed in trust and part in cash for the portion we are allowed to retain 
the costs to acquire the sales  primarily commissions and other direct costs  are reflected on the balance sheet as deferred charges asset and are charged to expense as the services are performed and products delivered 
indirect costs of marketing preneed services and merchandise are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
as the customer makes payments on the preneed contract  the portion of prearranged receivables representing the receivable due from the customer declines  and the portion representing the receivable from the trust increases 
we record cash for the amount of cash received that is not required to be placed in trust 
realized earnings on the amounts held in trust represent a debit to prearranged receivables asset and a credit to prearranged deferred revenue liability and are not recognized as revenue until delivery of the service or merchandise 
when the service or merchandise is delivered  we recognize as revenue the full contract amount plus all trust earnings associated with that contract  with a corresponding reduction recorded to prearranged deferred revenue liability 
we debit cash with the amount removed from trust that is attributable to the contract consisting of the customer s payments and related realized earnings  all of which is withdrawn at that time and record a corresponding reduction in prearranged receivables asset 
associated deferred charges asset are expensed  and the actual expenses incurred in delivering the services and merchandise are recognized 
additional information about our prearranged receivables and prearranged deferred revenue is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for preneed sales of interment rights cemetery property  the associated revenue and all costs to acquire the sale are recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
under sfas no 
 recognition of revenue and costs must be deferred until percent of the property sales price has been collected 
a portion  generally percent  of the sale proceeds are placed into perpetual care trust funds 
we withdraw and recognize realized earnings from these funds on a monthly basis to offset the cost of maintaining our cemetery grounds 
the perpetual care trust funds are not reflected on the financial statements because principal must remain in the trust in perpetuity 
some of our sales of preneed property  products and services are made under installment contracts bearing interest at prevailing rates 
finance charges are recognized as revenue under the effective interest method over the terms of the related installment receivables 

table of contents commissions and other direct costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new prearranged services and prearranged merchandise sales are deferred and amortized as the contracts are delivered in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for insurance companies 
indirect costs of marketing prearranged services are expensed in the period in which incurred 
all direct costs to acquire the sales of preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services are included in deferred charges asset 
the costs to acquire all preneed merchandise and service sales are included in the operating section of the cash flow statement as prearranged acquisition costs 
prearranged services and merchandise generally are funded either through trust funds or escrow accounts established by us or through third party insurance companies 
when prearranged services and merchandise are funded through insurance policies purchased by customers from third party insurance companies  we earn a commission on the sale of the policies 
insurance commissions  net of related expenses  are recognized at the point at which the commission is no longer subject to refund 
policy proceeds including the buildup in the face value of the insurance contracts are available to us as services and merchandise are delivered 
prearranged receivables are related to preneed sales of funeral and cemetery merchandise and services 
prearranged receivables represent the funds owed to us from preneed funeral merchandise and services trusts and from preneed cemetery merchandise and services trusts  which represent amounts already paid by customers  and realized earnings on those amounts  from customers and from insurance companies 
prearranged deferred revenue represents the revenue we will recognize upon delivery of the preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services at the time of need 
the net change in prearranged receivables and prearranged deferred revenue is recognized in the cash flow statement in the operating section as a change in prearranged activity 
if a preneed funeral product or service contract is cancelled  we generally return to the customer the related principal that was placed in trust and retain the portion not placed in trust 
in many jurisdictions  we can withdraw and retain all related earnings in the trust  but in other jurisdictions these earnings must be returned to the customer 
if a preneed cemetery property  product or service contract is cancelled  we generally are not required to return any funds to the customer 
the impact of preneed sales on near term cash flow depends primarily on the commissions paid on the sale  the portion of the sale required to be placed into trust and the terms of the particular contract such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
we generally pay commissions to our preneed sales counselors based on a percentage of the total preneed contract price  but only to the extent cash is paid by the customer 
if the initial cash installment paid by the customer is not sufficient to cover the entire commission  the remaining commission is paid from subsequent customer installments 
however  because we are required to place a portion of each cash installment paid by the customer into trust  we may be required to use our own cash to cover a portion of the commission due on the installment from the customer 
accordingly  preneed sales are generally cash flow negative initially but become cash flow positive at varying times over the life of the contract  depending upon the trusting requirements and the terms of the particular contract 
cash expended for preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service sales  principally sales commissions  is capitalized in deferred charges on the balance sheet and amortized and expensed as cost of sales as the contracts are delivered 
summary of current accounting for trust and escrow account earnings we have three types of trust funds and escrow accounts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services and perpetual care 
as described below  earnings on preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts are accounted for in the same manner 
the accounting for earnings on perpetual care trust funds differs from the other two types of trust funds due to the nature of the trusts  as described below 

table of contents preneed funeral merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts 
we defer recognition of all earnings realized by preneed funeral merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts until the underlying funeral service or merchandise is delivered 
this accounting method was not affected by the implementation of sab no 
we generally do not withdraw cash principal and earnings from these trust funds and escrow accounts until the merchandise or service is delivered 
principal and realized earnings in these funds and escrow accounts are reflected as prearranged receivables  net asset on the balance sheet 
the full contract amount and realized earnings in these funds and escrow accounts are reflected as prearranged deferred revenue  net liability on the balance sheet 
unrealized gains and losses are not reflected on the balance sheet or income statement but are included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item preneed cemetery merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts 
as discussed above  effective november   we implemented sab no 
and changed our method of accounting for earnings realized by preneed cemetery merchandise and services trust funds and escrow accounts 
we now defer all earnings realized by these trust funds and escrow accounts until the underlying merchandise or service is delivered 
we generally do not withdraw cash principal and earnings from these trust funds and escrow accounts until the merchandise or service is delivered 
principal and realized earnings in these funds and escrow accounts are reflected as prearranged receivables  net asset on the balance sheet 
the full contract amount and realized earnings in these funds and escrow accounts are reflected as prearranged deferred revenue  net liability on the balance sheet 
unrealized gains and losses are not reflected on the balance sheet or income statement but are included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item perpetual care trust funds 
pursuant to perpetual care contracts and laws  a portion  generally percent  of the proceeds from cemetery property sales is deposited into perpetual care trust funds 
the income from these funds  which have been established in most jurisdictions in which we operate cemeteries  is used for maintenance of our cemeteries  but principal  including in some jurisdictions net realized capital gains  must generally be held in perpetuity 
we recognize the earnings on our perpetual care trust funds as they are realized in the trust 
this accounting method was not affected by the implementation of sab no 
we generally withdraw the earnings on a monthly basis to offset the cost of maintaining our cemeteries 
principal in these funds is not reflected on the balance sheet because the principal must remain in the trust in perpetuity 
overview of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the following are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
allowance for doubtful accounts management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
we establish a reserve for uncollectible installment contracts and trade accounts based on a range of percentages applied to accounts receivable aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount 
depreciation of long lived assets buildings and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years and from to years  respectively  primarily using the straight line method 
these estimates of the useful lives may be affected by such factors as changes in regulatory requirements or changing market conditions 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets we periodically review for continued appropriateness the carrying value of our long lived assets including our prearranged receivables  cemetery property and property  plant and equipment 
this review is based on our projections of anticipated undiscounted future cash flows 
if indicators of impairment were present  we would evaluate the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets compared to the carrying amount of those items 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable would be reduced to fair value 
while we believe that our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a valuation allowance of million related to our prearranged receivable from our trust funds which resulted in a reduction in prearranged receivables and a reduction in prearranged deferred revenue 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item valuation of intangible assets and goodwill in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
although we are not required to implement sfas no 
until the first quarter of fiscal year  we implemented it in the first quarter of fiscal year see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of sfas no 
and its impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our evaluation of goodwill for our operations is performed at the funeral and cemetery segment levels  which constitute our reporting units 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill of a reporting unit must be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
impairment losses are recognized when the estimated fair value of goodwill associated with all of our cemeteries or funeral homes is less than their respective carrying values 
in addition to an annual review  we assess the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be greater than fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may be greater than fair value  we measure any impairment based on our estimates of current fair value compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to million as of october  and accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of earnings 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets 
table of contents and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
based on estimates of taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable  we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of october  in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations because we held our foreign operations and several small domestic operations for sale  in the third quarter of we began segregating the operating results of these businesses from the operations we will retain 
the following discussion segregates the financial results into two main categories in order to present our ongoing operating results and to provide more useful information for investors 
operations to be retained consist of those businesses we have owned and operated for the entire current fiscal year and last and that we plan to retain existing operations and those businesses that have been opened during this fiscal year or last and that we plan to retain opened operations 
closed and held for sale operations consist of those that have been sold or closed during this fiscal year or last and the businesses that are currently being offered for sale

table of contents operations to be retained for increased by million when compared to the year ended october   and total funeral gross profit for decreased by million when compared to the corresponding period in total funeral revenue decreased million for the year ended october  compared to the corresponding period in primarily due to a decrease in revenue from closed and held for sale operations  which was partially offset by an increase in revenue from operations to be retained 
the decline in revenue from closed and held for sale operations resulted primarily from the sale of our operations in mexico  australia  new zealand  belgium and the netherlands in the fourth quarter of and the sale of our operations in spain  portugal  france  canada and argentina in fiscal year funeral revenue from operations to be retained increased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in the average revenue per funeral service performed by these businesses increased percent  partially offset by a 
percent decline events in the number of funeral services performed 
we experienced a million  or percent  increase in funeral revenue from existing operations primarily due to a percent increase in the average revenue per funeral service performed  partially offset by a percent decline  events in the number of funeral services performed by these businesses 
the increase in average revenue per funeral service is due primarily to customized funeral planning and personalization 
we experienced a million increase in funeral revenue and a million increase in funeral costs from opened operations primarily due to the opening of an archdiocese of los angeles facility which was not open for the entirety of both periods presented 
funeral gross profit margin from existing operations increased from percent for the year ended october  to percent for the corresponding period in this increase is due to the elimination of goodwill amortization from the implementation of sfas no 
if we had implemented sfas no

we experienced an annual average return of percent in our perpetual care trust funds for the year ended october   compared to percent for the corresponding period in we also experienced a million decline in revenue from closed and held for sale operations primarily related to the sale of our foreign operations 
cemetery gross profit margin from existing operations decreased from percent for the year ended october  to percent for the corresponding period in the decrease is due to the decline in preneed cemetery property sales and merchandise deliveries and the decrease in perpetual care trust earnings coupled with the high fixed cost nature of the cemetery business 
the decrease was moderated by the elimination of goodwill amortization from the implementation of sfas no 
if we had implemented sfas no 
in  the pro forma cemetery gross profit margin from existing operations adjusted for the elimination of goodwill amortization would have been percent for the year ended october  goodwill amortization for existing operations in the cemetery segment amounted to million for the year ended october  other corporate general and administrative expenses for the year ended october  decreased

adoption of the serp resulted in a charge to corporate general and administrative expenses of million for fiscal year and is expected to result in a charge of approximately million annually 
depreciation and amortization was million for the year ended october  compared to million for the same period in  which included million of goodwill amortization 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization is due to the implementation of sfas no 
and the sale of certain of our foreign assets 
domestic depreciation and amortization  which is representative of operations to be retained  was million for fiscal year compared to million for the same period in  which included million of domestic goodwill amortization

ebitda is frequently used by security analysts and is presented here to provide additional information about our operations 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings  as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a better measure of liquidity 
ebitda is a non gaap measure and may not be comparable as calculated by us to ebitda as calculated by other companies 
interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended october  compared to million for the same period in the decrease is due to a million decrease in the average debt outstanding during the fiscal year ended october   offset by an approximate basis point increase in our average interest rate 
the increase in our average interest rate resulted from higher interest costs associated with debt incurred in our debt refinancing transactions which occurred on june  investment income decreased million to 
million for the year ended october  compared to the same period in this decrease is due primarily to a million decrease in the average cash and cash equivalents balance and a decrease in the average investment rate earned on our cash and cash equivalent investments from percent to percent 
the percent earned for the year ended october  included returns on funds in foreign jurisdictions that earned percent 
the majority of the funds in foreign jurisdictions were sold with our mexican operations 
other income  net  decreased million to million during the year ended october  compared to the same period in the decrease is principally due to the net gains on the sale of excess cemetery property and other domestic assets during as of october   our outstanding debt was million 
of the total amount outstanding  including the portion subject to the interest rate swap agreements in effect as of october   approximately percent was fixed rate debt  with the remaining percent subject to a short term variable interest rate of approximately percent 
in order to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt  effective march   we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  expiring on march  and march   each involving a notional amount of million 
the agreements effectively convert variable rate debt bearing interest based on three month libor plus the applicable margin specified under our senior secured credit facility to fixed rate debt bearing interest at the fixed swap rate plus such applicable margin 
as of january   the effective rate of the debt hedged by the interest rate swaps was percent and percent on each million swapped 
preneed sales the revenues from our domestic preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service sales are deferred into our backlog and are not included in our operating results above 
we added million in preneed sales to our funeral and cemetery merchandise and service backlog during the year ended october  to be recognized in the future as these prepaid products and services are delivered  compared to million for the corresponding period in year ended october  compared to year ended october  we implemented sab no 
in fiscal year in the following discussion  the results for the year ended october   as reported after the implementation of sab no 
 are compared with the results for the year ended october   as reported  which do not reflect the implementation of sab no 
we have also included a pro forma comparison using the same accounting methods for both years 
for the pro forma discussion  the year ended october  is presented as reported after the implementation of sab no 
 and the year ended october  is adjusted on a pro forma basis to show the effects of sab no 
 as if it had been adopted at the beginning of that year 

table of contents funeral segment year ended october  decrease as reported in millions funeral revenue funeral costs funeral gross profit funeral revenue decreased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in we experienced a million  or percent  decrease due to the effect of implementing sab no 
additionally  during fiscal year  we sold several of our foreign operations with the remainder held for sale  and several small domestic operations have either been sold or are held for sale 
this resulted in a decline in funeral revenue and costs as described below in the section entitled year ended october  compared to pro forma year ended october  slightly offsetting these decreases was an increase in the average revenue per funeral service performed by operations to be retained of percent and an increase of percent in the number of funeral services performed by operations to be retained events 
cemetery segment year ended october  decrease as reported in millions cemetery revenue cemetery costs cemetery gross profit cemetery revenue decreased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in we experienced a decrease in cemetery merchandise deliveries and reduced preneed cemetery property sales 
we also experienced an average return of percent in our perpetual care trust funds  which is below our goal of percent to percent  compared to percent in fiscal year partially offsetting this decrease was a million  or percent  increase due to the implementation of sab no 
in fiscal year we changed the terms and conditions of our preneed sales contracts and commissions and moderated our preneed sales activities in order to enhance our cash flow 
this resulted in an anticipated reduction in preneed sales  including preneed cemetery property sales mentioned above 
we modified our preneed payment plans early in fiscal year by increasing finance charges  requiring larger down payments and shortening installment payment terms 
effective the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we also substantially reduced the commissions paid on sales of preneed cemetery services and preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise  which we believe had the largest impact on preneed sales 
although we reduced or eliminated commissions available to preneed sales counselors on certain sales  we now provide a minimum compensation guarantee 
the change in commission structure provides an incentive to preneed sales counselors to focus on selling preneed cemetery property and preneed funeral services 
we believe that these are the sales that build and maintain market share 
in addition  the change better aligned operations with changes in accounting necessitated by the adoption of sab no 
because  after the implementation of sab no 
 preneed cemetery property sales are the only preneed sales that we recognize on a current basis after collection of percent of the sales price 
we also believe that these changes have improved the quality of preneed sales and receivables 
these changes in preneed sales strategies contributed to a decline in the full time domestic preneed sales force from approximately  counselors during the first quarter of fiscal year to  counselors by the end of fiscal year we believe that we have retained our best sales counselors 
we have also reduced our selling costs by closing selected telemarketing and sales offices 

table of contents other corporate general and administrative expenses in decreased million as compared to primarily due to consulting fees incurred in related to our extensive consumer market research project 
interest expense increased million to million for the year ended october  compared to million for the same period in the increase is due to a basis point increase in the average interest rate resulting from higher interest costs associated with debt incurred in our debt refinancing transactions 
this increase was substantially offset by a million decrease in the average outstanding debt balance 
investment income increased 
million to million for the year ended october  compared to the same period in this increase resulted from cash and cash equivalent investments earning an average rate of percent including funds in foreign jurisdictions earning percent 
other income  net  increased approximately million during fiscal year compared to the same period in due principally to net gains on the sale of excess cemetery property 
in december  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on a notional amount of million 
under the terms of the agreement  effective march   we pay a fixed rate of percent and receive three month libor 
the swap expires on march   at which time the million becomes subject to short term variable interest rates 
as of october   our outstanding debt totaled million  including million of debt associated with assets held for sale 
of the total amount outstanding  including the portion subject to the interest rate swap agreement  approximately percent was fixed rate debt  with the remaining percent subject to short term variable interest rates averaging approximately percent

table of contents total funeral revenues declined million from fiscal year to  primarily due to a decrease in revenue from closed and held for sale operations  which was partially offset by an increase in revenue from operations to be retained 
this decrease in revenue from closed and held for sale operations resulted from the sale of operations in mexico  australia  new zealand  belgium and the netherlands in the fourth quarter of and changes in foreign currency exchange rates due in part to the euro 
funeral revenue from operations to be retained increased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in the average revenue per funeral service performed by these businesses increased percent  and the number of funeral services performed by these businesses increased percent events 
we experienced a million  or percent  increase in funeral revenue from existing operations primarily due to a percent increase in the average revenue per funeral service partially offset by a percent decline events in the number of funeral services performed by these businesses 
about percent of the decline in the number of funeral services performed by existing operations was attributable to a decline in low priced services that we elected to stop performing 
excluding these low priced services  the number of funeral services performed by our existing funeral homes declined less than one percent  or one to two funerals per location 
these low priced services consist primarily of services performed in the ordinary course of business in the industry on behalf of another funeral home or institution  and we believe they are not indicative of a loss in market share 
we experienced a million increase in funeral revenue and a million increase in funeral costs from opened operations primarily due to the opening of the archdiocese of los angeles facilities which were not open for the entirety of both periods presented 
funeral gross profit margin from existing operations decreased from percent in to percent in primarily due to upward pressure on funeral costs  including labor costs  of approximately million as well as an increase in overhead costs allocated to the funeral segment of approximately million 
we allocate common overhead between our segments based on revenue 
due to the moderation in preneed cemetery sales discussed above  the allocation has shifted a higher amount of those costs to the funeral segment and a corresponding lower amount to the cemetery segment

the reduction in preneed sales was anticipated due to the changes made to our preneed sales program in fiscal year  as discussed above in the section entitled year ended october  compared to year ended october  cemetery segment 
in addition  we experienced an average return of percent in our perpetual care trust funds  which was below our goal of percent to percent  compared to percent in fiscal year cemetery gross profit margin from existing operations increased from percent in to percent in the increase was principally due to cost savings resulting from the changes we made in our preneed sales organization and additional cost savings at our cemeteries arising from increased scrutiny of expenses by local managers 
additionally  the cemetery margins benefited from the reduction in common overhead allocation mentioned in year ended october  compared to pro forma year ended october  funeral segment

preneed sales in fiscal year  we sold approximately two domestic funerals for every one that we delivered 
throughout fiscal year we changed the terms and conditions of our preneed sales contracts and commissions as described above in the section entitled year ended october  compared to year ended october  cemetery segment 
in fiscal year  we further moderated our preneed sales strategy in order to improve our cash flow and modified our goal to begin selling four funerals for every three we delivered  which we achieved 
our domestic preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service sales  the revenues from which are deferred and are not included in our operating results above  decreased from million for the year ended october  to million for the corresponding period in liquidity and capital resources introduction historically  our growth has been primarily from acquisitions 
this trend began to change in late fiscal year as industry conditions reduced the number of major consolidators participating in the acquisition market  those that remained generally applied significantly tighter pricing criteria  and many potential sellers withdrew their businesses from the market rather than pursue transactions at lower prices 
as the business model shifted  death care consolidators experienced diminishing access to capital 
in response to these changes  we ceased our acquisition activity and developed strategies for improving cash flow and reducing and restructuring debt 
throughout fiscal years  
table of contents and  we focused on debt reduction and cash flow 
during fiscal year  we began positioning ourselves for business expansion in fiscal year debt restructuring and reduction  asset sales as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  on june   we completed several transactions that refinanced substantially all of our long term debt 
in addition  in the third quarter of fiscal year  we decided to pursue the sale of our foreign operations in order to generate cash to reduce debt and to allow us to focus on our core businesses 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we sold our foreign operations in mexico  australia  new zealand  belgium and the netherlands 
during fiscal year  we sold our remaining operations in spain  portugal  france  canada and argentina 
in total  these transactions have generated or will generate total proceeds  including future tax benefits  of approximately million  which is at the top end of our previously estimated range of million to million 
we have received million in cash related to these sales and expect to realize the majority of the remaining proceeds of approximately million in income tax benefits during fiscal year all net proceeds related to the sale of foreign operations have been used to repay debt 
additional information about our sale of foreign operations appears in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item additionally  in fiscal year  we realized million in proceeds from the sale of certain domestic properties  including million from the sale of excess cemetery property and approximately million from the sale of funeral home real estate and small domestic operations 
these proceeds were used to reduce debt 
we further reduced debt in fiscal year with approximately million in proceeds from the sale of certain domestic funeral homes and cemeteries 
with the proceeds of these transactions combined with cash flow  we reduced our debt from million at the beginning of fiscal year to million as of january   which included million of the unamortized option premium relating to our percent remarketable or redeemable securities roars 
long term debt as of october  was million  which included million of the unamortized option premium related to the roars

table of contents years  except for six leases that expire between and our future minimum lease payments as of october  are million  million  million  million  million and million for the years ending october      and later years  respectively 
we have entered into non competition agreements with prior owners and key employees of acquired subsidiaries that expire through during fiscal year  we decided to relieve some of the prior owners and key employees of their obligations not to compete  however  we will continue to make the payments in accordance with the contract terms 
the following table reflects future scheduled principal payments and maturities of our long term debt in millions as of october  other  principally seller senior financing of year ending term subordinated public notes acquired october  loan b notes public notes roars operations total thereafter subtotal unamortized option premium relating to remarketable or redeemable securities roars total long term debt we could be required to redeem the roars on may  if the debt is not remarketed  which will depend primarily upon prevailing market conditions at that time 
as of october   we had sufficient availability under our revolver to redeem the roars  and after giving effect to the redemption  we would have available liquidity as defined in the senior secured credit facility  of no less than million 
accordingly  we have classified the roars as long term debt 
we also have million of outstanding letters of credit as of october   and we are required to maintain a bond to guarantee our obligations relating to funds we withdrew from our preneed funeral trusts in florida 
we substituted a bond to guarantee performance under certain preneed funeral contracts and agreed to maintain unused credit facilities in an amount that will equal or exceed the bond amount 
as of october   the balance of the florida bond was million 
we believe that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to cover our estimated cost of providing the related prearranged services and products in the future 
under our senior secured credit facility  as long as any of the percent notes or roars are outstanding  we must maintain a required reserve consisting of availability under the revolving credit facility and or domestic cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  the access to which is restricted on terms satisfactory to the collateral agent 
the required reserve is an amount equal to the lesser of the amount by which the net cash proceeds from asset sales calculated on a cumulative basis from the completion of the refinancing transactions exceeds million and the outstanding principal amount of the percent notes and roars 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the required reserve cannot be less than the following percentages of the outstanding principal amount of the percent notes and roars percent through october   percent thereafter through january   percent thereafter through april  and percent thereafter 
if the roars are remarketed  which would occur  if at 
table of contents all  on may   they would not be considered outstanding for purposes of the requirement to maintain the required reserve  and the required reserve for the roars would therefore be eliminated 
in that case  the portion of the revolver restricted for purposes of the required reserve would then become available to us 
as of october  and january   our required reserve was million 
as of october  and january   there were no amounts drawn on our million revolving credit facility 
as of october  and january   our availability under the revolver  after giving consideration to the aforementioned letters of credit  bond obligation and million required reserve  was million and million  respectively 
as of october  and january   million and million were available under the revolver to redeem the roars  respectively 
in order for us to purchase or otherwise retire any of the remaining percent notes or roars prior to maturity  we must provide evidence satisfactory to the administrative agent under the senior secured credit facility that  immediately after giving effect to the transaction  we will have available liquidity  as defined in the senior secured credit facility  of no less than million 
as of october   we have outstanding million percent roars due may  remarketing date may  
amounts outstanding under the roars must be redeemed by us or remarketed by the remarketing dealer on may  if the remarketing dealer does not elect to remarket the roars  we must redeem them on may  for percent of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
if the remarketing dealer elects to remarket the roars  we may override that election by choosing to redeem them on may  for percent of their principal amount plus accrued interest  in which case we will be obligated to pay the remarketing dealer the value of our remarketing right  which was million as of january  if the roars are remarketed  holders immediately prior to may  must tender them to the remarketing dealer for purchase on may  for a purchase price of percent of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
if remarketed  the roars will become due may   and the coupon for the remaining term will be percent which was the year united states treasury rate at the time of initial issuance plus our then current credit spread 
as of october   we had sufficient availability under our revolver to redeem the roars  and after giving effect to the redemption  we would have liquidity as defined in the senior secured credit facility  of no less than million 
accordingly  we have classified the roars as long term debt 
for additional discussion regarding the impact of the potential redemption of the roars  see forward looking statements 
cash flow our operations provided cash of million for the year ended october  which included million of tax benefits related to the sale of our foreign operations 
for fiscal year  our operations provided cash of million 
the decrease in operating cash flow is due primarily to a reduction in earnings  resulting primarily from decreases in funeral gross profit primarily associated with assets sold or held for sale  decreases in cemetery gross profit primarily associated with operations to be retained  a decline in nonrecurring gains related to the sale of excess cemetery property in and a decline in investment income 
additionally  there was an million decrease in inventory related to the sale of excess cemetery property in that resulted in a net cash source which did not re occur in  as well as other working capital changes 
our investing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a net cash inflow of million for fiscal year the million reduction is due primarily to million in proceeds from the sale of our foreign operations  domestic funeral home real estate and small domestic operations we received in compared to million received in this was partially offset by a reduction in additions to property and equipment due to a reduction in new growth spending 
our financing activities resulted in a cash outflow of million for the year ended october   compared to a cash outflow of million for the comparable period in this is due principally to repayments of long term debt of million during the year ended october  and debt issue costs of million associated with our june debt refinancing  partially offset by proceeds from long term debt of million from the debt refinancing 
also offsetting this cash outflow was million that we withdrew from our trust funds in florida in the first quarter of  for which we substituted a bond to guarantee performance under certain preneed funeral contracts and agreed to maintain unused credit facilities in an amount that will equal or exceed the bond amount 

table of contents capital expenditures as part of our strategy to increase cash flow and reduce debt  in fiscal year we limited our capital expenditures primarily to maintenance capital expenditures and the construction of funeral homes in connection with our operating partnership with the archdiocese of los angeles 
for a discussion of the operating partnership with the archdiocese of los angeles  see business strategy and operations 
for fiscal year  capital expenditures amounted to million  which included million for maintenance capital expenditures and million for new growth initiatives  including the construction of the archdiocese of los angeles funeral homes 
for fiscal year  we anticipate maintenance capital expenditures consistent with fiscal year and new growth initiatives of up to million  including the construction of the los angeles funeral homes 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures in fiscal year other than approximately million to million related to the archdiocese of los angeles funeral homes 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was as follows years ended october  pretax earnings for fiscal year include a nonrecurring  noncash charge of million in connection with the vesting of performance based stock options 
excluding the charge  our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for fiscal year would have been 
excludes the cumulative effect of change in accounting principles 
pretax earnings for fiscal year include a noncash charge of million in connection with the writedown of assets held for sale and other charges 
as a result of this charge  our earnings for the fiscal year ended october  were insufficient to cover our fixed charges  and an additional million in pretax earnings would have been required to eliminate the coverage deficiency 
excluding the charge  the early extinguishment of debt and the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principles  our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for fiscal year would have been 
pretax earnings for fiscal year include a noncash charge of million in connection with the writedown of assets held for sale 
excluding the charge  our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for fiscal year would have been 
for purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges  earnings consist of pretax earnings plus fixed charges excluding interest capitalized during the period 
fixed charges consist of interest expense  capitalized interest  amortization of debt expense and discount or premium relating to any indebtedness and the portion of rental expense that management believes to be representative of the interest component of rental expense 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the year ended october  reflects the implementation of sfas no 
 fiscal year reflects the change in accounting principles  fiscal years and reflect the change in accounting principle  and fiscal year reflects the accounting methods in effect in that year 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations over the past three years  nor is it expected to have a significant impact in the foreseeable future

on december   we filed a form k with more detailed information discussing our financial forecasts for the summarized forecast information below is consistent with the information contained in that form k 
the financial forecasts included in this form k have been prepared by  and are the responsibility of  our management 
pricewaterhousecoopers llp has neither examined nor compiled the financial forecasts and  accordingly  pricewaterhousecoopers llp does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto 
the pricewaterhousecoopers llp report included in this form k relates to our historical financial information 
it does not extend to the forecasted information and should not be read to do so 
accuracy of the forecasts is dependent upon assumptions about events that change over time and is thus susceptible to periodic change based on actual experience and new developments 
the forecasts are based on a variety of estimates and assumptions made by our management with respect to  among other things  industry performance  general economic  market  industry and interest rate conditions  preneed and at need sales activities and trends  fluctuations in cost of goods sold and other expenses  capital expenditures  and other matters that cannot be accurately predicted  may not be realized and are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the assumptions made in preparing the forecasts will prove accurate  and actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forecasts 
for these reasons  the forecasts should not be regarded as an accurate prediction of future results  but only of results that may be obtained if substantially all of our principal expectations are realized 
we caution readers that we assume no obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements made herein or any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
our current goal is to improve the results from our existing businesses by growing revenue by approximately to basis points greater than the growth in our cost of sales 
we believe that this alone will produce high single digit growth in earnings per share 
our longer term objective is to return to double digit growth through the disciplined execution of our long term growth plan 
another important goal is to reduce our outstanding debt to million 
during fiscal year  we completed the sale of all of our foreign operations within our targeted timeframe  resulting in cash proceeds in our estimated range 
our goal was to sell our foreign operations and receive proceeds including tax benefits in the range of million to million 
now that all sales are completed  we expect to ultimately receive total proceeds of approximately million 
we have received million of the proceeds and expect to realize the majority of the remaining proceeds 
table of contents of approximately million of income tax benefits during as of january   our remaining outstanding debt was approximately million 
with the future tax proceeds of million that we expect to realize  we will need less than million of our cash flow to achieve our debt target during fiscal or depending on the timing of the realization of our tax benefits 
we believe there are a variety of growth opportunities available to us now 
acquiring high quality cemeteries and funeral homes that are priced within our guidelines and that fit our new business model will be a priority 
we have begun the process of re entering the acquisition arena  but expect to move slowly and carefully 
we also plan to continue to build funeral homes in our cemeteries  construct funeral homes in third party cemeteries and open freestanding funeral homes in select markets 
our goal is to produce a percent to percent internal rate of return on the deployment of our cash 
we project that earnings will be between and per share for fiscal year  excluding any impact from potential acquisitions and excluding any impact from the potential redemption of the roars as discussed below 
excluding any impact from potential acquisitions and the potential redemption of the roars  we expect cash flow from operations to be between million and million and expect free cash flow cash flow from operations less maintenance capital expenditures to be between million and million 
free cash flow is frequently used by security analysts and is presented here to provide additional information about our operations 
free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a better measure of liquidity 
free cash flow is a non gaap measure and may not be comparable as calculated by us to free cash flow as calculated by other companies 
we expect the following factors to impact fiscal year financial results internal growth domestic revenues are expected to grow approximately to basis points greater than the growth in cost of sales 
rising insurance costs the terrorist attacks in the united states on september  and related subsequent events have resulted in higher insurance premiums 
the volume of claims made in such a short span of time resulted in liquidity challenges that many insurers have passed on to their policyholders 
additionally  insurers have increased premiums to offset losses in equity markets due to recent economic conditions 
our insurance costs are expected to increase materially in returns on preneed trust funds from through we were successful in achieving an overall annual return of percent to percent in our preneed trust funds 
however  the average return on our domestic funeral and cemetery trust funds has been percent  percent and percent  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
these returns represent interest  dividends and realized capital gains or losses but not unrealized capital gains or losses 
we defer recognition of all earnings and losses realized by preneed trust funds until the underlying products and services are delivered 
consequently  the lower returns recently realized are expected to reduce the trust earnings to be recognized as revenue in reduced interest costs interest expense is expected to decrease as a result of a reduction in our average debt balance 

table of contents elimination of earnings contribution from foreign operations earnings are expected to decrease due to the elimination of earnings contributed by our foreign operations  however  the reduction in operating earnings from the sale of our foreign operations that remained during fiscal year spain  portugal  france  canada and argentina is expected to be substantially offset by interest expense savings resulting from the use of proceeds from these sales to reduce our average debt balance 
potential redemption of the roars in may the forecasts above do not include any impact from the potential redemption of the remarketable or redeemable securities roars in may we are currently considering redeeming the roars as an alternative to allowing them to be remarketed when they mature on may  if they are redeemed  we must pay the remarketing dealer an amount equal to the contractually specified value of the remarketing right the calculation amount 
the calculation amount will depend largely on the then applicable year treasury rate  which was percent at january  if the year treasury rate is percent on may   the calculation amount would be million 
if the year treasury rate increases  the calculation amount will be lower than this amount  and if the year treasury rate decreases  the calculation amount will be higher than this amount 
if the treasury rate rises to percent  the calculation amount will decrease to zero 
if we redeem the roars and are required to pay the calculation amount  interest expense would be increased for fiscal year by the calculation amount  and cash flow would be reduced by the after tax effect of the calculation amount 
as indicated above  the calculation amount could be substantial  however  we received million from the remarketing dealer at the time of the issuance of the roars for the right to remarket the roars  and we have had the use of these funds since that time 
as of october   we had million of unamortized roars option premium which includes the unamortized portion of the million payment we received from the remarketing dealer at the time of the issuance of the roars for the right to remarket the roars 
if we redeem the roars  interest expense for fiscal year would be reduced by the unamortized premium on may  of approximately million 
we cannot predict the value of the year treasury rate as of may  or whether the remarketing dealer will elect to remarket the roars  and we have not determined whether we will elect to redeem the roars if the remarketing dealer elects to remarket them 
accordingly  we have not included any impact from the potential redemption of the roars in fiscal year forecasts 
cautionary statements we caution readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future  could affect  our actual consolidated results and could cause our actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the goals and expectations expressed in the forward looking statements above and in any other forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
risks related to our business if the remarketing dealer elects to remarket our million outstanding percent roars on may   and we elect to prevent that by redeeming them  we would be required to pay the remarketing dealer the value of the remarketing right at that time  which could have a material adverse effect on our fiscal year interest expense  earnings and cash flow 
we are currently considering redeeming the roars as an alternative to allowing them to be remarketed when they mature on may  if they are redeemed  we must pay the remarketing dealer an amount equal to the contractually specified value of the remarketing right the calculation amount 
the calculation amount will depend largely on 
table of contents the then applicable year treasury rate 
if we redeem the roars and are required to pay the calculation amount  interest expense would be increased for fiscal year by the amount of the calculation amount  and cash flow would be reduced by the after tax effect of the calculation amount 
we cannot predict the value of the year treasury rate as of may  or whether the remarketing dealer will elect to remarket the roars  and we have not determined whether we will elect to redeem the roars if the remarketing dealer elects to remarket them 
accordingly  we have not included any impact from the potential redemption of the roars in fiscal year forecasts

earnings from and principal of trust funds and escrow accounts could be reduced by changes in stock and bond prices and interest and dividend rates or by a decline in the size of the funds 
earnings and investment gains and losses on trust funds and escrow accounts are affected by financial market conditions that are not within our control 
earnings are also affected by the mix of fixed income and equity securities that we choose to maintain in the funds  and we may not choose the optimal mix for any particular market condition 
the size of the funds depends upon the level of preneed sales and maturities  the amount of investment gains or losses and funds added through acquisitions  if any 
declines in earnings from perpetual care trust funds would cause a decline in current revenues  while declines in earnings from other trust funds and escrow accounts could cause a decline in future cash flows and revenues 
in addition  any significant or sustained investment losses could result in there being insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the cost of delivering services and merchandise or maintaining cemeteries in the future 
any such deficiency would have to be covered by cash flow  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of october   net unrealized depreciation in the funeral  cemetery merchandise and perpetual care trust funds and escrow accounts amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
see notes and in our consolidated financial statements included in item unrealized gains and losses in the funeral trust funds and cemetery merchandise trust funds have no immediate impact on our revenues  margins  earnings or cash flow  unless the fair market value of the funds were to decline below the estimated costs to deliver the underlying products and services 
if that were to occur  we would record a charge to earnings to record the expected loss currently 
over time  gains and losses realized in the funds are allocated to underlying preneed contracts and affect the amount of the trust fund earnings to be recognized when we deliver the underlying product or service 
accordingly  if current market conditions do not improve  the funds may eventually realize losses  and our revenues  margins  earnings and cash flow would be negatively affected by the reduced revenue when we deliver the underlying products and services 
in addition  any significant or sustained investment losses could result in there being insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the cost of delivering services and merchandise or maintaining cemeteries in the future 
any such deficiency would have to be covered by cash flow  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we estimate that with approximately percent to percent annual returns in the funds over the estimated lives of the associated preneed contracts  our trust and escrow funds would recover the net unrealized depreciation currently in the funds by the time the underlying products and services are delivered 
increased costs may have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows 
cost increases may impair our ability to achieve revenue growth that exceeds our cost increases 
our plan assumes that we will be successful in increasing domestic revenues at a rate approximately to basis points greater than the growth in the cost of sales 
although we believe we can achieve that goal  we have not achieved that goal in recent years  and we can give no assurance that we will be successful in doing so in we expect insurance costs  in particular  to increase substantially in the terrorist attacks in the united states on september  and related subsequent events have resulted in higher insurance premiums 
the volume of claims made in such a short span of time resulted in liquidity challenges that many insurers have passed on to their policyholders 
additionally  insurers have increased premiums to offset losses in equity markets due to recent economic conditions 
while our insurance costs are expected to increase materially  the actual increase in insurance costs cannot be predicted 

table of contents our ability to achieve our debt reduction targets and to service our debt in the future depends upon our ability to generate sufficient cash  which depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our ability to achieve our debt reduction targets in the time frame projected by us depends upon our ability to generate sufficient cash from two main sources income tax proceeds associated with the foreign asset sales and our ongoing operations 
we expect to generate capital gains against which the foreign asset sale capital losses may be offset 
there can be no assurance that we will receive the tax benefits within our expected timeframe 
our ability to receive the expected income tax benefits within our expected timeframe depends upon  among other things  the timing of our filing for capital loss carrybacks to apply against previously taxed capital gains and the rate at which we realize additional capital gains 
our tax planning strategy is to produce these capital gains in our trust funds 
our ability to generate capital gains could be affected by a decline in market conditions 
our ability to generate cash flow from operations depends upon  among other things  the number of deaths in our markets  competition  the level of preneed sales and their maturities  our ability to control our costs  stock and bond market conditions  and general economic  financial and regulatory factors  most of which is beyond our control 
we may experience declines in preneed sales due to numerous factors including changes made to contract terms and sales force compensation  or a weakening economy 
declines in preneed sales would reduce our backlog and revenue and could reduce our future market share 
in an effort to increase cash flow  we modified our preneed sales strategies early in fiscal year by increasing finance charges  requiring larger down payments and shortening installment payment terms 
later in fiscal year  we changed the compensation structure for our preneed sales force 
these changes  and the accompanying sales force attrition and adverse impact on sales force morale  caused preneed sales to decline 
although we do not anticipate making further significant changes in these areas  we may decide that further adjustments are advisable  which could cause additional declines in preneed sales 
in addition  a weakening economy that causes customers to have less discretionary income could cause a decline in preneed sales 
declines in preneed cemetery property sales would reduce current revenue  and declines in other preneed sales would reduce our backlog and future revenue and could reduce future market share 
increased preneed sales may have a negative impact on cash flow 
preneed sales of cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services are generally cash flow negative initially  primarily due to the commissions paid on the sale  the portion of the sales proceeds required to be placed into trust or escrow and the terms of the particular contract such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
see summary of current accounting for preneed sales under the heading general 
in fiscal year  we changed the terms and conditions of preneed sales contracts and commissions and moderated our preneed sales effort in order to reduce the initial negative impact on cash flow 
nevertheless  we will continue to invest a significant portion of cash flow in preneed acquisition costs  which reduces cash flow available for other activities  and  to the extent preneed activities are increased  cash flow will be further reduced  and our ability to service debt could be adversely affected 
price competition could reduce market share or cause us to reduce prices to retain or recapture market share  either of which could reduce revenues and margins 
our funeral home and cemetery operations generally face intense competition in local markets that typically are served by numerous funeral homes and cemetery firms 
we have historically experienced price competition primarily from independent funeral home and cemetery operators  and from monument dealers  casket retailers  low cost funeral providers and other non traditional providers of services or products 
in the past  this price competition has resulted in losing market share in some markets 
in other markets  we have had to reduce prices thereby reducing profit margins 
table of contents in order to retain or recapture market share 
increased price competition in the future could further reduce revenues  profit margins and the backlog 
increased advertising or better marketing by competitors  or increased activity by competitors offering products or services over the internet  could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to incur increased costs in order to retain or recapture our market share 
in recent years  marketing through television  radio and print advertising  direct mailings and personal sales calls has increased with respect to the sales of preneed funeral services 
extensive advertising or effective marketing by competitors in local markets could cause us to lose market share and revenues or cause us to increase marketing costs 
in addition  competitors may change the types or mix of products or services offered 
these changes may attract customers  causing us to lose market share and revenue or to incur costs in response to competition to vary the types or mix of products or services offered by us 
also  increased use of the internet by customers to research and or purchase products and services could cause us to lose market share to competitors offering to sell products or services over the internet 
increases in interest rates would increase interest costs on our variable rate long term debt and could have a material adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share 
as of october   million of our long term debt was subject to variable interest rates  although million of that amount was fixed pursuant to the terms of interest rate swaps expiring in march of and accordingly  any significant increase in interest rates  could increase our interest costs on our variable rate long term debt  which could decrease our net income and earnings per share 
covenant restrictions under our senior secured credit facilities and senior subordinated note indenture limit our flexibility in operating our business 
our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes contain  among other things  covenants that restrict us and our subsidiary guarantors ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
they limit  among other things  our subsidiary guarantors ability to borrow money  pay dividends or distributions  purchase or redeem stock  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in sale leaseback transactions  consummate specified asset sales  effect a consolidation or merger or sell  transfer  lease  or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets  and create liens on assets 
in addition  the senior secured credit facility contains specific limits on capital expenditures as well as a requirement that we maintain a liquidity reserve that increases over time as long as any of the percent notes or percent roars are outstanding 
furthermore  the senior secured credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests and prohibit payment of the percent notes and percent roars unless thereafter our available liquidity  as defined  is no less than million 
these covenants may require us to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
in addition  events beyond our control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  may affect our ability to satisfy these covenants 
a breach of any of those covenants could result in a default allowing the lenders to declare all amounts immediately due and payable 
our projections for do not include any earnings from acquisition activity 
several important factors  among others  may affect our ability to consummate acquisitions 
our projections for do not include any earnings from acquisition activity 
the actual level of acquisition activity  if any  will depend not only on the number of properties acquired  but also on the size of the acquisitions 
several important factors  among others  may affect our ability to consummate acquisitions 
we may not be able to find a sufficient number of businesses for sale at prices we are willing to pay  particularly in view of our new pricing 
table of contents parameters and cash flow criteria 
acquisition activity  if any  will also depend on our ability to enter into new markets 
due in part to our lack of experience operating in new areas and to the presence of competitors who have been in certain markets longer than we have  such entry may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate 
risks related to the death care industry declines in the number of deaths in our markets can cause a decrease in revenues 
changes in the number of deaths are not predictable from market to market or over the short term 
declines in the number of deaths could cause at need sales of funeral and cemetery services  property and merchandise to decline  which could decrease revenues 
although the united states bureau of the census estimates that the number of deaths in the united states will increase by approximately percent per year from to  longer lifespans could reduce the rate of deaths 
for example  data obtained from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc indicate a decrease in deaths in the united states of percent during our fiscal year ended october   compared to the same period in the prior year 
in addition  changes in the number of deaths can vary among local markets and from quarter to quarter  and variations in the number of deaths in our markets or from quarter to quarter are not predictable 
these variations can cause revenues to fluctuate 
our comparisons of the change in the number of families served to the change in the number of deaths reported by the cdc from time to time may not necessarily be meaningful 
the cdc receives weekly mortality reports from cities and metropolitan areas in the united states within two to three weeks from the date of death and reports the total number of deaths occurring in these areas each week based on the reports received from state health departments 
the comparability of our funeral calls to the cdc data is limited  as reports from the state health departments are often delayed  and the cities reporting to the cdc are not necessarily comparable with the markets in which we operate 
nonetheless  we believe that the cdc data is the most comprehensive data of this kind available 
the increasing number of cremations in the united states could cause revenues to decline because we could lose market share to firms specializing in cremations 
in addition  basic cremations produce no revenues for cemetery operations and lesser funeral revenues and  in certain cases  lesser profit margins than traditional funerals 
our traditional cemetery and funeral service operations face competition from the increasing number of cremations in the united states 
industry studies indicate that the percentage of cremations has steadily increased and that cremations will represent approximately percent of the united states burial market by the year  compared to percent in the trend toward cremation could cause cemeteries and traditional funeral homes to lose market share and revenues to firms specializing in cremations 
in addition  basic cremations with no funeral service  casket  urn  mausoleum niche  columbarium niche or burial produce no revenues for cemetery operations and lower revenues than traditional funerals and  when delivered at a traditional funeral home  produce lower profit margins as well 
if we are not able to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences  our market share  revenues and profitability could decrease 
future market share  revenues and profits will depend in part on our ability to anticipate  identify and respond to changing consumer preferences 
during fiscal year  we began to implement strategies based on a proprietary  extensive study of consumer preferences we commissioned in however  we may not correctly anticipate or identify trends in consumer preferences  or we may identify them later than our competitors do 
in addition  any strategies we may implement to address these trends may prove incorrect or ineffective 
because the funeral and cemetery businesses are high fixed cost businesses  positive or negative changes in revenue can have a disproportionately large effect on cash flow and profits 
companies in the funeral home and cemetery business must incur many of the costs of operating and maintaining 
table of contents facilities  land and equipment regardless of the level of sales in any given period 
for example  we must pay salaries  utilities  property taxes and maintenance costs on funeral homes and maintain the grounds of cemeteries regardless of the number of funeral services or interments performed 
because we cannot decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when we experience declines in sales  declines in sales can cause margins  profits and cash flow to decline at a greater rate than the decline in revenues 
changes or increases in  or failure to comply with  regulations applicable to our business could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
the death care industry is subject to extensive regulation and licensing requirements under federal  state and local laws 
for example  the funeral home industry is regulated by the federal trade commission  which requires funeral homes to take actions designed to protect consumers 
state laws impose licensing requirements and regulate preneed sales 
embalming facilities are subject to stringent environmental and health regulations 
compliance with these regulations is burdensome  and we are always at risk of not complying with the regulations 
in addition  from time to time  governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations  which could increase costs or decrease cash flows 
for example  federal  state  local and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the death care industry 
as discussed in item under the heading regulation  senator dodd has recently proposed legislation that  if adopted  would more heavily regulate the death care industry 
if adopted  this bill could result in an increase in our costs 
several states and regulatory agencies have considered or are considering regulations that could require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for preneed sales of products and services  limit or eliminate our ability to use surety bonding  increase trust requirements and prohibit the common ownership of funeral homes and cemeteries in the same market 
if adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate  these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial condition  our results of operations and our future prospects

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in the prices of marketable equity securities and interest rates as discussed below 
generally  our market risk sensitive instruments and positions are characterized as other than trading 
our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in equity markets or interest rates 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based on actual fluctuations in equity markets  interest rates and the timing of transactions 
marketable equity securities as of october  and  our marketable equity securities subject to market risk consisted principally of investments held by our prearranged funeral  merchandise and perpetual care trust funds and escrow accounts and had fair values of million and million  respectively  which were determined using final sale prices quoted on stock exchanges 
each percent change in the average market prices of the equity securities held in such accounts would result in a change of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair value of such accounts 
our prearranged funeral  merchandise and perpetual care trust funds and escrow accounts  which are managed by iti  are detailed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in item iti operates pursuant to a formal investment policy as discussed in operations included in item 
table of contents interest we have entered into various fixed and variable rate debt obligations  which are detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item as of october  and  the carrying values of our long term fixed rate debt  including accrued interest and the unamortized portion of the roars option premium  were approximately million and million  respectively  compared to fair values of million and million  respectively 
fair values were determined using quoted market prices  where applicable  or future cash flows discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
each approximate percent change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt  and basis points for and  respectively  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair values of these instruments 
if these instruments are held to maturity  no change in fair value will be realized 
in order to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt  during the first quarter of  we entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement involving a notional amount of million
