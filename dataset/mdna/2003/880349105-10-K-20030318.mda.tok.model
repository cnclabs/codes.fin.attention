item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as you read the following review of our financial condition and results of operations  you should also read our financial statements and related notes beginning on page background tenneco automotive inc is one of the world s leading manufacturers of automotive emissions control and ride control products for both the original equipment oe market and aftermarket 
we completed the separation of our packaging business in a series of transactions during  culminating in the spin off to our shareholders of the common stock of pactiv corporation formerly known as tenneco packaging inc on november  years and operating units results net sales and operating revenues change millions north america   europe   rest of world revenues from our north american operations increased million in compared to the same period last year 
higher sales from the original equipment business were partially offset by aftermarket volume softness in both product lines  primarily in the fourth quarter 
total north american oe revenues increased percent to  million in due to higher volumes and increased catalytic converter sales that are passed through to our customers 
oe exhaust revenues were up percent in primarily due to increased volumes and higher pass through sales 
these pass through catalytic converter sales occur when  at the direction of our oe customers  we purchase catalytic converters or components from suppliers  use them in our manufacturing process  and sell them as part of the completed system 
oe ride control revenues for increased percent  driven by increased volumes in both the light vehicle and heavy duty market 
total oe revenues  excluding million of pass through sales  increased percent in  while north american light vehicle production increased approximately percent over our revenue increase was greater than the build rate increase as a result of the introduction of new platforms  on which we are a supplier  ramping up and outpacing the overall build rate 
aftermarket revenues for north america were million for  representing a decrease of percent compared to the prior year 
aftermarket ride control revenues increased one percent in  as a result of new customer additions in the second half of and the first quarter of offsetting overall softness in the ride control aftermarket  particularly in the second half of aftermarket exhaust revenues declined percent in reflecting an overall market decline in the exhaust business 
partially offsetting the volume decreases were price increases in both product lines and a shift toward premium products which positively impacted revenues by million in our european segment s revenues decreased million or percent in compared to the prior year 
total oe revenues were million for oe exhaust revenues declined percent to million from million the prior year 
excluding a million decrease in pass through sales and a million net increase due to strengthening currency  oe exhaust revenues declined percent 
oe ride control revenues increased to million or percent  from million for excluding a million net benefit from currency appreciation  oe ride control revenues declined one percent 
light vehicle production by european oe manufacturers was down about percent in versus our oe exhaust decline was greater than the decline in the european light vehicle build rate primarily due to timing issues experienced in the second and third quarters of between retiring platforms and the launch of new platforms on which we are the supplier 
nearly all of the platforms planned for launch during this period have commenced production and most are now at or near expected volumes 
our oe ride control revenue decline was less than the decline in the european light vehicle build rate as a result of stronger sales on our existing platforms 
european aftermarket sales were million in compared to million in the prior year 
excluding million attributable to currency appreciation  aftermarket revenues declined percent due primarily to the continued decline in exhaust replacement rates as a result of the increasing use of stainless steel new vehicles 
this decline was partially offset by the launch of monroe reflex r shocks and struts  our premium ride control product  in the second quarter of revenues from our operations in the rest of the world increased million to million in as compared to million in the prior year 
higher volumes and increased pass through sales drove increased revenues of million at our asian operations 
stronger volumes and strengthening currency also increased australian revenues by million 
these increases were partially offset by the effects of the weakened south american economy  where revenues declined by million 
income before interest expense  income taxes  and minority interest ebit year ended december  change millions north america europe rest of world the ebit results shown in the preceding table include the following items  discussed below  which have an effect on the comparability of ebit results between periods year ended december  millions north america restructuring charges reversals non accruable restructuring related expenses amendment of senior credit facility environmental reserve europe restructuring charges reversals non accruable restructuring related expenses amendment of senior credit facility environmental reserve gain on sale of york  uk uk rest of world restructuring charges reversals amendment of senior credit facility ebit for north american operations increased to million in from million one year ago as higher sales volumes in our oe segment improved our earnings for the year 
stronger volumes and volume related manufacturing efficiencies contributed million to oe profitability 
the elimination of goodwill amortization  discussed later in this management s discussion and analysis under the section changes in accounting principles  contributed million to the ebit increase 
partially offsetting these increases were increased selling  general and administrative costs  million in restructuring related expenses that could not be accrued related to our project genesis restructuring efforts net of a million favorable adjustment to the reserve for the costs to complete the first phase of project genesis and million in costs associated with amending our senior credit facility 
in the north american aftermarket  price increases instituted in and a shift toward premium products increased ebit by million and lower changeover costs and manufacturing efficiencies and distribution increased ebit by million 
partially offsetting these increases were lower volumes in the aftermarket emission control product line which reduced ebit by million 
included in north america s prior year results were charges related to our restructuring efforts and the establishment of an environmental reserve that reduced ebit by million in the aggregate 
our european segment s ebit declined to million in from million the previous year 
volume decreases and related operating inefficiencies in both the oe and aftermarket operations negatively impacted ebit by million 
in the current year  we also incurred approximately million in restructuring related expenses that could not be accrued related to our project genesis restructuring efforts and million in costs associated with amending our senior credit facility 
european ebit in was also reduced by million due to an increase in reserves for warranty issues 
see environmental and other matters later in this management s discussion and analysis for a more detailed discussion of these warranty issues 
partially offsetting these decreases was the gain on the sale of our york  uk facility  which increased ebit by million 
a favorable adjustment in the reserve for our costs to complete our restructuring efforts also increased ebit by million 
additionally  the elimination of goodwill amortization and lower selling  general and administrative overhead costs offset some of the decrease 
included in europe s prior year results were charges related to our restructuring efforts  the establishment of an environmental reserve and costs associated with amending our senior credit facility that reduced ebit by million in the aggregate 
ebit for our operations in the rest of the world increased by million in compared to the previous year 
stronger volumes in asia and australia were offset by manufacturing inefficiencies and a weakened south american economy 
included in our results was a favorable adjustment in the reserve for our costs to complete the first phase of project genesis  which increased ebit by million 
included in the rest of the world s prior year s results were charges related to our restructuring efforts and costs associated with amending our senior credit facility that reduced ebit by million  in the aggregate 
ebit as a percentage of revenue year ended december  north america europe rest of world total tenneco automotive in north america  ebit as a percentage of revenue increased by percent for stronger oe volumes drove the increase 
additionally  volume related manufacturing efficiencies and the elimination of goodwill amortization contributed to the increase 
north american ebit margins in  on the other hand  were significantly impacted by our restructuring activities 
in europe  ebit margins declined in due to significant decreases in both oe and aftermarket volumes 
also contributing to the decline were volume related manufacturing inefficiencies 
partially offsetting these decreases was the gain on the sale of our york  uk facility 
ebit as a percentage of revenue for the rest of the world remained flat year over year as improved operating performance was offset by manufacturing inefficiencies and a weakened south american economy 
restructuring and other charges over the past several years we have adopted plans to restructure portions of our operations 
these plans were approved by the board of directors and were designed to reduce operational and administrative overhead costs throughout the business 
prior to the change in accounting required for exit or disposal activities described under changes in accounting principles below  we recorded charges to income related to these plans for costs that do not benefit future activities in the period in which the plans were finalized and approved  while actions necessary to affect these restructuring plans occurred over future periods in accordance with established plans 
we are conducting all workforce reductions in compliance with all legal and contractual requirements including obligations to consult with worker s councils  union representatives and others 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan to reduce administrative and operational overhead costs 
we recorded  in the fourth quarter of  a pre tax charge related to the plan of million  million after tax  or 
per diluted common share 
within the statement of income  million of the pre tax charge is reflected in cost of sales  while million is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the charge is comprised of million of severance and related costs for salaried employment reductions worldwide and million for the reduction of manufacturing and distribution capacity in response to long term market trends 
the plan involved closing a north american aftermarket exhaust distribution facility and a ride control manufacturing plant in our asian market  as well as the consolidation of some exhaust manufacturing facilities in europe 
in addition  the plan involved the elimination of positions  including temporary employees 
we wrote down the assets at the locations to be closed to their estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
we estimated the market value of buildings using external real estate appraisals 
as a result of the single purpose nature of the machinery and equipment to be disposed of  fair value was estimated to be scrap value less costs to dispose in most cases 
we do not expect that cash proceeds on the sale of these assets will be significant 
as of december   employees have been terminated under the plan primarily in north america and europe 
additionally  temporary employees have been terminated 
all restructuring actions related to this plan have been completed 
we executed the plan more efficiently than initially anticipated and as a result in the fourth quarter of we reversed million of the charge to the statement of income  of which million is recorded in cost of sales and million is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
also in the fourth quarter of  we recorded other charges of million  million after tax  or 
per diluted common share 
these charges related to a strategic decision to reduce some of the aftermarket parts we offer and to relocation expenses incurred associated with the restructuring plans 
the aftermarket parts were written down to their estimated scrap value less costs to sell 
in the first quarter of  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan in response to increasingly difficult industry conditions 
on january   we announced plans to eliminate salaried positions worldwide 
we recorded pre tax charges related to this restructuring of million  million after tax  or 
per diluted common share 
within the statement of income  million of the pre tax charge is reflected in cost of sales  while million is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these charges are comprised of million for severance and related costs for salaried employment reductions worldwide and million for costs related to closing a testing facility in north america 
as of december   we have eliminated positions in connection with the first quarter plan 
we have completed all restructuring activities related to this plan 
we executed the plan more efficiently than initially anticipated and as a result in the fourth quarter of reversed million in reserves related to this restructuring activity 
all of the reversal was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in the second quarter of  our board of directors approved a separate restructuring plan related to closing a north american ride control production line 
we recorded pre tax charges related to the plan of million  million after tax  or 
per diluted common share 
within the statement of income  the million charge is included in cost of sales 
we wrote down the assets to their fair market value  less costs to sell 
as a result of the single purpose nature of the machinery and equipment to be disposed of  fair value was estimated to be scrap value less costs to dispose 
cash proceeds from the sale of these assets were not significant 
all restructuring activities related to this plan have been completed 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan  the first phase of a project known as project genesis  designed to lower our fixed costs  improve efficiency and utilization  and better optimize our global footprint 
the first phase of project genesis involved closing eight facilities  improving the process flow and efficiency through value mapping and plant arrangement at facilities  relocating production among facilities  and centralizing some functional areas 
the closed facilities include an emissions control aftermarket plant and an aftermarket distribution operation in europe  a ride control plant in europe  an engineering center in europe  one building at an emissions control plant complex in north america  a technology facility in north america  an exhaust manufacturing facility in north america  and our london based treasury office 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded pre tax charges related to project genesis of million 
within the statement of income  million of the pre tax charge is reflected in cost of sales  while million is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these charges are comprised of million in severance and million for equipment lease cancellation  asset impairment and other restructuring costs to close the eight facilities 
we wrote down the assets at locations to be closed to their estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
we estimated the market value of buildings using external real estate appraisals 
as a result of the single purpose nature of the machinery and equipment to be disposed of  fair value was estimated to be scrap value less costs to dispose in most cases 
we also recorded a pre tax charge of million in cost of sales related to a strategic decision to adjust some product offerings and our customer supply strategy in the european aftermarket 
the aftermarket parts were written down to their estimated scrap value  less costs to sell 
finally  we also incurred million in other restructuring related costs during the fourth quarter for the value mapping and rearrangement of one of our emissions control plants in north america 
since these costs relate to ongoing operations  they could not be accrued as part of the restructuring charge 
the total of all these restructuring and other costs recorded in the fourth quarter of was million before tax  million after tax  or 
per diluted common share 
as of december   we have eliminated positions in connection with the first phase of project genesis 
additionally  we are executing this plan more efficiently than originally anticipated and as a result in the fourth quarter of reduced our reserves related to this restructuring activity by million which is recorded in cost of sales 
we expect to complete all remaining restructuring activities related to the first phase of project genesis in the first half of in addition to the fourth quarter charges  we incurred other costs during of million for moving and rearrangement activities related to project genesis that could not be accrued as part of the restructuring charge 
during we generated about million of savings from project genesis 
about million of savings was related to closing the eight facilities  about million of savings was related to value mapping and plant arrangement and about million of savings was related to relocating production among facilities and centralizing some functional areas 
to date  there have been no significant deviations from planned savings 
when complete  we expect that the series of restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of will generate annualized savings of million 
about million of the expected savings should be generated by closing the eight facilities  about million of the expected savings should be generated by improving process flow and efficiency through value mapping and plant arrangement and about million of the expected savings will be generated by relocating production among facilities and centralizing some functional areas 
amounts related to activities that are part of all the restructuring plans discussed above are as follows december  charged to impact of december  restructuring cash asset exchange reserve restructuring reserve payments accounts rates adjustments reserve millions severance asset impairment other in the second quarter of  we sold a manufacturing facility in the uk that we closed in an earlier restructuring plan 
included in charged to asset accounts in the preceding table is an adjustment to the assumptions made in the recording of the uk facility s restructuring reserve 
the proceeds of million exceeded our original estimates of the market value of the property 
consequently  after the adjustment  we recorded a pre tax gain of million on the sale in the second quarter of this gain is shown in the statement of income as a gain on sale of assets 
under the terms of an amendment to our senior credit agreement that took effect on march   we are allowed to exclude up to million of cash charges and expenses  before taxes  related to potential future cost reduction initiatives over the period from the calculation of the financial covenant ratios we are required to maintain under our senior credit agreement 
in addition to the announced actions  we continue to evaluate additional opportunities  including additional phases of project genesis  to initiate actions that will reduce our costs through implementing the most appropriate and efficient logistics  distribution  and manufacturing footprint for the future 
there can be no assurances however  that we will undertake additional phases of project genesis or other additional restructuring actions 
actions that we take  if any  will require the approval of our board of directors and  if the costs of the plans exceed the amount previously approved by our senior lenders  could require approval by our senior lenders 
we plan to conduct any workforce reductions that result in compliance with all legal and contractual requirements including obligations to consult with workers councils  union representatives and others 
interest expense  net of interest capitalized we reported interest expense of million in  compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in total interest expense is due to lower interest rates on our variable rate debt and overall lower debt balances 
capitalized interest was million in and million in see liquidity and capital resources capitalization later in this management s discussion and analysis for a more detailed description of our borrowings 
included in our current interest expense is the financial impact of the three year floating to fixed rate swaps we put in place in early on million of our senior term loans  as required by our senior credit agreement 
based on then current short term interest rates  these swaps added approximately million to our interest expense for these swaps expired on february  income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of million in the current year benefit included a million tax benefit related to lower than expected costs for withholding taxes related to our foreign operations 
the lower cost of tax withholding for the first half of tax repatriation transaction resulted from an amendment to our bank agreement allowing a more tax efficient transaction to be completed 
we also recorded an million benefit in the current year related to accrual to return adjustments in foreign jurisdictions and a million benefit related to a decrease in the corporate tax rate in belgium from percent to percent 
including all these items  the effective tax rate was a negative percent for excluding these items our effective tax rate was percent for we recorded tax expense in of million 
tax expense for included a million expense for repatriation of earnings from some of our foreign subsidiaries 
we took this action to better facilitate movement of cash balances among our overseas subsidiaries while minimizing cash tax payments in foreign jurisdictions 
including this item  our effective tax rate was an expense of percent for excluding this adjustment our effective tax rate was a percent benefit on our pre tax loss 
the primary reason that this differed from our statutory tax rate of percent was the non deductible portion of our restructuring charges 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for a reconciliation of our tax expense to the statutory rate 
earnings per share we reported earnings per diluted common share before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of 
for the year ended december   compared to a loss of for the same period in included in results are the negative impacts from expenses related to our restructuring plans and the costs related to the amendment of certain terms of the senior credit facility  offset by the gain on the sale of our york  uk facility  tax benefits related to lower than expected costs for withholding taxes and an accrual to return adjustment in a foreign jurisdiction and favorable adjustments to our reserves for restructuring activities 
the net impact of these items improved earnings per diluted common share by 
in addition  in we recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of per diluted share to record the impact of the new accounting standard for goodwill 
see changes in accounting principles below for more information about this charge 
included in results for are the impacts from charges and expenses related to our restructuring plans  the tax charge for repatriation of foreign earnings  environmental remediation activities and the costs related to the amendment of certain terms of the senior credit facility 
these items reduced earnings per diluted common share by 
you should also read note to the financial statements included in item for more detailed information on earnings per share 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas where estimates are required 
we recognize revenue for sales to our original equipment and aftermarket customers under the terms of our arrangements with those customers  generally at the time of shipment from our plants or distribution centers 
for our aftermarket customers  we provide for promotional incentives and returns at the time of sale 
estimates are based upon the terms of the incentives and historical experience with returns 
where we have offered product warranty  we also provide for warranty costs 
those estimates are based upon historical experience and upon specific warranty issues as they arise 
while we have not experienced any material differences between these estimates and our actual costs  it is reasonably possible that future warranty issues could arise that could have a significant impact on our financial statements 
we expense pre production design and development costs incurred for our original equipment customers unless we have a contractual guarantee for reimbursement of those costs from the customer 
at december   we had million recorded as a long term receivable from original equipment customers for guaranteed pre production design and development arrangements 
while we believe that the vehicle programs behind these arrangements will enter production  these arrangements allow us to recover our pre production design and development costs in the event that the programs are cancelled or do not reach expected production levels 
we have not experienced any material losses on arrangements where we have a contractual guarantee of reimbursement from our customers 
we have a us federal tax net operating loss nol carryforward at december   of million  which will expire in varying amounts from to the federal tax effect of that nol is million  and is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet at december  we estimate  based on available evidence  that it is more likely than not that we will utilize the nol within the prescribed carryforward period 
that estimate is based upon our expectations regarding future taxable income of our us operations and upon strategies available to accelerate usage of the nol 
circumstances that could change that estimate include future us earnings at lower than expected levels or a majority ownership change as defined in the rules of the us tax law 
if that estimate changed  we would be required to cease recognizing an income tax benefit for any new nol and could be required to record a reserve for some or all of the asset currently recorded on our balance sheet 
as of december   we believe that there has been a significant change in our ownership  but not a majority change  since the spin off of pactiv 
we utilize the intrinsic value method to account for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
if our compensation costs for our stock based compensation plans were determined using the fair value method of accounting as provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we estimate that our pro forma net income and earnings per share for the full year would be lower by million or 
per diluted share 
changes in accounting principles in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
changes the accounting for purchased goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
therefore amortization of all purchased goodwill  including amortization of goodwill recorded in past business combinations  ceased upon adoption of sfas no 
in january goodwill was amortized at the rate of million in and million in  prior to adopting the new standard 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we were required to perform an impairment analysis on the balance of goodwill at january  the fair value of our reporting units used in determining the goodwill impairment was computed using the present value of expected future cash flows 
as a result of this analysis  we determined that goodwill associated with our north american ride control and european aftermarket operations was impaired 
as a result  a charge of million  net of taxes of million  was recorded in the first quarter of as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the balance of unamortized goodwill was million at december  we are required to test this balance for impairment on an annual basis 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will be required to adopt the new standard by january  we do not believe that the effect of adopting this statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses recognition  presentation and disclosure of impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for assets to be disposed of  and accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
was effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
changes the definition of the date at which a liability exists for exit or disposal activities also referred to as restructuring activities 
previously  we recognized a liability for restructuring activities when we committed to a plan of restructuring and announced this plan to the employees 
we will be required to apply the new standard prospectively to new exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the new statement will generally require that these costs be recognized at a later date and over time  rather than in a single charge 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  which expands previously issued accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
fin provides that issuing a guarantee imposes a noncontingent obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that the conditions specified in the guarantee occur  and that a liability representing the fair value of such a guarantee must be recognized when the guarantee is issued 
we will be required to apply these initial recognition and measurement provisions to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
see stock options included in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item for our compliance with the new transition and disclosure requirements of sfas no 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires that the assets  liabilities and results of the activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial statements of the entity that has the controlling financial interest 
fin also provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated based on voting interest or significant financial support provided to it 
this interpretation is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january  and effective july  for variable interest entities created before february  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources capitalization year ended december  change millions short term debt and current maturities long term debt   total debt   total minority interest common shareholders equity total capitalization   the year to date decrease in shareholders equity primarily results from our recorded net loss of million  which resulted from the charge of million related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for goodwill 
stockholders equity also decreased due to an adjustment to the additional minimum pension liability of million as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the plan assets 
these declines were partially offset by a million increase in the fair market value of our interest rate swaps and million related to the translation of foreign balances into us dollars 
although our book equity balance was negative at december   it should not affect our business operations 
we have no debt covenant ratios that are based upon our book equity and there are no other agreements that are adversely impacted by our negative book equity 
short term debt  which includes the current portion of long term obligations and borrowings by foreign subsidiaries  as well as our revolving credit facility  increased by million during this increase resulted from an increase in borrowings of million during under our revolving credit facility 
a million decrease in our foreign subsidiaries borrowings and a million decrease in the current portion of long term debt partially offset this increase 
the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december  were million and were million as of december  the decline in long term debt represents amounts due during we did not issue any long term debt during our financing arrangements are primarily provided by a committed senior secured financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions  which was billion at december  we entered into an agreement to amend this facility on october  to i relax the financial covenant ratios beginning in the fourth quarter of  ii exclude up to million of cash charges and expenses related to cost reduction initiatives from the calculation of consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda used in our financial covenant ratios through and iii make certain other technical changes 
in exchange for these amendments  we agreed to certain interest rate increases  lowered our capital expenditure limits and paid an aggregate fee of about million 
as a result of significant reductions in north american vehicle production levels announced in by our original equipment customers  as well as an accelerated weakening of the global aftermarket  we entered into a second amendment of our senior credit facility on march  the second amendment revised the financial covenant ratios we were required to maintain as of the end of each of the quarters ending in the second amendment also reduced the limitation on capital expenditures from million to million  and required that net cash proceeds from all significant  non ordinary course asset sales be used to prepay the senior term loans 
in exchange for these amendments  we agreed to a basis point increase in interest rates on the senior term loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and paid an aggregate fee of million to consenting lenders 
we incurred legal  advisory and other costs related to the amendment process of million 
at the time of the second amendment  we expected that we would meet with the senior lenders during the first quarter of to negotiate further amendments to the senior credit facility 
consequently  we amended the senior credit facility for a third time on march  the third amendment revised the financial covenant ratios we are required to maintain as of the end of each of the quarters ending in  and it also extends the limitation on annual capital expenditures of million through this three year period 
the amendment further provides us with the option to enter into sale and leaseback arrangements on up to million of our assets 
the proceeds from these arrangements must be used to reduce senior debt 
these senior debt prepayments would reduce the next scheduled principal amortization payments 
because the payments on senior debt from sale and leaseback transactions would be made on a pro rata basis based on the remaining principal amounts outstanding on our tranche a  b  and c senior term loans  but principal amortization payments are not pro rata  about percent of any sale and leaseback transactions we enter into during would reduce our scheduled principal amortization 
the amendment also allows us to exclude up to million of cash charges and expenses  before taxes  related to any cost reduction initiatives over the period from the calculation of the financial covenant ratios we are required to maintain under our senior credit agreement 
it also permits us to execute exchanges of our senior subordinated bonds for shares of common stock 
we do not have any current plans to enter into any debt for stock exchanges 
any significant debt for stock exchange would require approval of our stockholders 
in exchange for these amendments  we agreed to a million reduction in our revolving credit facility  a basis point increase in interest rates on the senior term loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and paid an aggregate fee of million to consenting lenders 
we also incurred legal  advisory  and other costs related to the amendment process of million 
the senior secured credit facility  as amended on march   consists of i a million revolving credit facility with a final maturity date of november   ii a million term loan with a final maturity date of november   iii a million term loan with a final maturity date of november   and iv a million term loan with a final maturity date of may  quarterly principal repayment installments on each term loan began october  borrowings under the facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at our option  either i the london interbank offering rate plus a margin of basis points for the revolving credit facility and the term loan maturing november   basis points for the term loan maturing november  and basis points for the term loan maturing may   or ii a rate consisting of the greater of the jp morgan chase prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points  plus a margin of basis points for the revolving credit facility and the term loan maturing november   basis points for the term loan maturing november  and basis points for the term loan maturing may  we also pay a commitment fee of basis points on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
under the provisions of the senior credit facility agreement  the interest margins for borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan maturing november  and fees paid on letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment based on the consolidated leverage ratio consolidated indebtedness divided by consolidated ebitda as defined in the senior credit facility agreement measured at the end of each quarter 
our consolidated leverage ratio fell below as of june   therefore  the interest margins for borrowings under our revolving credit facility and on our term loan maturing november   and fees paid on letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility  were reduced by basis points beginning in the third quarter of our consolidated leverage ratio remained below as of december  our senior secured credit facility does not contain any terms that could accelerate the payment of the facility as a result of a credit rating agency downgrade 
the amended senior credit facility requires that we maintain financial ratios equal to or better than the following consolidated leverage ratios consolidated indebtedness divided by consolidated ebitda  consolidated interest coverage ratios consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated cash interest paid  and fixed charge coverage ratios consolidated ebitda less consolidated capital expenditures  divided by consolidated cash interest paid at the end of each period indicated 
the financial ratios required under the amended senior credit facility and  in the case of  the actual ratios we achieved are shown in the following tables quarter ending march  june  september  december  req

compliance with these requirements and restrictions is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the senior credit facility agreement and failure to meet these requirements enables the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans 
as of december   we were in compliance with both the financial covenants as indicated above and operational restrictions of the facility 
our outstanding debt also includes million of percent senior subordinated notes due october  the senior subordinated debt indenture requires that we  as a condition to incurring certain types of indebtedness not otherwise permitted  maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 
we have not incurred any of the types of indebtedness not otherwise permitted by this indenture 
the indenture also contains restrictions on our operations  including limitations on i incurring additional indebtedness or liens  ii dividends  iii distributions and stock repurchases  iv investments  and v mergers and consolidations 
all of our existing and future material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee these notes on a joint and several basis 
there are no significant restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries that have guaranteed these notes to make distributions to us 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions of this indenture 
in addition to our senior credit facility and senior subordinated notes  we also sell some of our accounts receivable 
in north america  we have an accounts receivable securitization program with a commercial bank 
we sell original equipment and aftermarket receivables on a daily basis under this program 
we had sold accounts receivable under this program of million and million at december  and  respectively 
this program is subject to cancellation prior to its maturity date if we were to i fail to pay interest or principal payments on an amount of indebtedness exceeding million  ii default on the financial covenant ratios under the senior credit facility  or iii fail to maintain certain financial ratios in connection with the accounts receivable securitization program 
in january  this program was amended to extend its term to january  and reduce the size of the program to million 
the reduced program size will lower commitment fees payable on the available and unused portion of the committed facility amount 
we also sell some receivables in our european operations to regional banks in europe 
at december   we had sold million of accounts receivable in europe 
the arrangements to sell receivables in europe are not committed and can be cancelled at any time 
if we were not able to sell receivables under either the north american or european securitization programs  our borrowings under our revolving credit agreement would increase 
these accounts receivable securitization programs provide us with access to cash at costs that are generally favorable to alternative sources of financing  and allow us to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
we believe that cash flows from operations  combined with available borrowing capacity described above  assuming that we maintain compliance with the financial covenants and other requirements of our loan agreement  will be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements for the following year  including scheduled debt principal amortization payments 
our ability to meet the financial covenants depends upon a number of operational and economic factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that could impact our ability to comply with the financial covenants include the rate at which consumers continue to buy new vehicles and the rate at which they continue to repair vehicles already in service  as well as our ability to successfully implement our restructuring plans 
lower north american vehicle production levels  weakening in the global aftermarket  or a reduction in vehicle production levels in europe  beyond our expectations  could impact our ability to meet our financial covenant ratios 
in the event that we are unable to meet these financial covenants  we would consider several options to meet our cash flow needs 
these options could include further renegotiations with our senior credit lenders  additional cost reduction or restructuring initiatives  sales of assets or common stock  or other alternatives to enhance our financial and operating position 
should we be required to implement any of these actions to meet our cash flow needs  we believe we can do so in a reasonable time frame 
contractual obligations our remaining required debt principal amortization and payment obligations under lease and certain other financial commitments are shown in the following table payments due in beyond total millions obligations revolver borrowings senior long term debt long term notes capital leases subordinated long term debt short term debt debt and capital lease obligations  operating leases capital commitments total payments  we principally use a revolving credit facility to finance our short term capital requirements 
as a result  we classify the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility within our short term debt 
the revolving credit facility balance included in short term debt is million and million at december  and  respectively 
if we do not maintain compliance with the terms of our senior credit facility and senior subordinated debt indenture described above  all amounts under those arrangements could  automatically or at the option of the lenders or other debt holders  become due 
additionally  each of those facilities contains provisions that certain events of default under one facility will constitute a default under the other facility  allowing the acceleration of all amounts due 
we currently expect to maintain compliance with terms of all of our various credit agreements for the foreseeable future 
we have also guaranteed payment and performance obligations of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
these guarantees are primarily related to performance of lease obligations by a former affiliate 
dividends on common stock during  we paid a quarterly dividend of 
per share of common stock 
dividend payments totaled million in on january   we announced that our board of directors eliminated the quarterly dividend on our common stock 
the board took the action in response to industry conditions  primarily greater than anticipated production volume reductions by original equipment manufacturers and continued softness in the global light vehicle aftermarket 
there are no current plans to reinstate a dividend on our common stock 
cash flows year ended december  millions cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities for the year ended december   cash flows provided by operating activities were million compared to million in the prior year 
higher earnings in the current year were a key driver to the increased cash provided 
in addition  we generated million in cash flow from working capital during  compared to million in the prior year 
in  we generated million in cash flow through better management of our payables 
at the end of  we reduced payable balances by taking advantage of early payment discounts in europe 
during we returned to our customary payment schedule  which increased payables balances and improved working capital 
additionally  in june of  we received a payment from an oe customer for the reimbursement of expenses related to a cancelled platform 
of the total cash payment  million was recorded in operating activities and the remaining balance was recorded in investing activities 
primarily offsetting these increases were increases in receivables as a result of lowered factoring levels and increases in inventories in anticipation of platform launches in see capitalization above for a description of our accounts receivable factoring program 
in june  we entered into arrangements with two major oe customers in north america under which  in exchange for a discount that is less than our marginal borrowing cost  payments for product sales are made earlier than otherwise required under existing payment terms 
these arrangements reduced accounts receivable by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these arrangements can be cancelled at any time 
on january  we signed a two year extension to our accounts receivable securitization program in the us the two year program will next be subject to renewal on january  with the two year extension  the size of the program has been reduced from million to million 
investing activities cash used for investing activities was million lower in compared to the prior year  due primarily to million in net proceeds from the sale of our york  uk facility and a million settlement from an oe customer for reimbursement of expenses related to a cancelled platform 
capital expenditures were million in  up million from million in the prior year 
the increase is partially attributable to capital spending for project genesis  which was million in financing activities cash used for financing activities was million in  compared to cash provided of million in the prior year 
we made senior debt principal payments of million on our senior credit facility in included in these payments was a pre payment on the senior term loans of million in september using the net cash proceeds we received in the second quarter from the sale of our york  uk facility 
partially offsetting these payments was an estimated increase in our revolving credit facility borrowings of million 
outlook north america light vehicle production continued at a relatively strong pace in manufacturer incentives kept consumer purchases higher than estimates at the beginning of the year 
consequently  the north america light vehicle build rate was an estimated million units 
however  we remain cautious regarding volumes due to continuing uncertain economic conditions in the us and uncertainty about the willingness of the original equipment manufacturers to continue to support consumer automobile sales through incentives 
additionally  we believe that there could be a negative impact on consumer confidence and buying due to the threat of a war  or an actual war  in the middle east  which could result in lower oe production levels and reduced aftermarket sales in production of heavy duty trucks was also strong during we believe  however  that the implementation of new emissions standards in october caused operators to pull forward their truck purchases into the first three quarters of we believe these advance purchases will reduce sales of heavy duty trucks into in europe  uncertain economic conditions have contributed to declining car sales  reducing light vehicle production 
additionally  several platforms for which we provide parts have reached the end of their production  and replacement platforms have been slow to launch 
these issues  combined  significantly reduced our volumes in europe in  particularly in the emissions control business 
while we expect that platform launches will ramp up  offsetting part of this decline  we expect oe production to be below last year in europe 
further  the economic problems in argentina and uncertainty in brazil are likely to result in lower sales in that region of the world in environmental and other matters we are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate 
we expense or capitalize  as appropriate  expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that relate to current operations 
we record expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation 
we record liabilities when environmental assessments indicate that remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the liability are based upon currently available facts  existing technology  and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors 
we consider all available evidence including prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites  other companies cleanup experiences and data released by the united states environmental protection agency or other organizations 
these estimated liabilities are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information 
where future cash flows are fixed or reliably determinable  we have discounted the liabilities 
all other environmental liabilities are recorded at their undiscounted amounts 
we evaluate recoveries separately from the liability and  when they are assured  recoveries are recorded and reported separately from the associated liability in our financial statements 
as of december   we are designated as a potentially responsible party in three superfund sites 
we have estimated our share of the remediation costs for these sites to be less than million in the aggregate 
in addition to the superfund sites  we may have the obligation to remediate current or former facilities  and we estimate our share of remediation costs at these facilities to be approximately million 
for both the superfund sites and the current and former facilities  we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for these costs 
although we believe our estimates of remediation costs are reasonable and are based on the latest available information  the cleanup costs are estimates and are subject to revision  as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required 
at some sites  we expect that other parties will contribute to the remediation costs 
in addition  at the superfund sites  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act provides that our liability could be joint and several  meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our share of remediation costs 
our understanding of the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at the superfund sites  and of other liable parties at our current and former facilities  has been considered  where appropriate  in our determination of our estimated liability 
we undertook a third party evaluation of estimated environmental remediation costs at one of our facilities beginning in the evaluation was initiated as a result of testing that indicated the potential underground migration of some contaminants beyond our facility property 
we completed and analyzed the results of our evaluation of contamination and migration from that facility 
we initially increased the reserve by million in the fourth quarter of related to on site remediation activities and million in the first quarter of following evaluation of needed off site remediation activities 
however  after further investigation of alternative remediation technologies  we were able to identify a more efficient technology and therefore reduced the reserve by million in the fourth quarter of there have been no significant changes in the reserve for we believe that any potential costs associated with our current status as a potentially responsible party in the superfund sites  or as a liable party at our current or former facilities  will not be material to our results of operations or consolidated financial position 
as previously discussed  from time to time we are subject to product warranty claims whereby we are required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products 
warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field 
in the second quarter  based on available facts and data at the time  we increased our warranty reserve in the amount of million for recently identified warranty issues 
based on our investigations and achievement of other commercial resolutions of these issues since that time  we presently believe that future costs or charges  if any  related to these issues will not be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we also from time to time are involved in legal proceedings or claims that are incidental to the conduct of our business 
some of these proceedings allege damages against us relating to environmental liabilities including toxic tort  property damage and remediation  intellectual property matters including patent  trademark and copyright infringement  and licensing disputes  personal injury claims including injuries due to product failure  design or warnings issues  and other product liability related matters  employment matters  and commercial or contractual disputes  sometimes related to acquisitions or divestitures 
we will continue to vigorously defend ourselves against all of these claims 
although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty  based on present information  including our assessment of the merits of the particular claim  we do not expect that these legal proceedings or claims will have any material adverse impact on our future consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in addition  we are subject to a number of lawsuits initiated by a significant number of claimants alleging health problems as a result of exposure to asbestos 
many of these cases involve significant numbers of individual claimants 
however  only a small percentage of these claimants allege that they were automobile mechanics who were allegedly exposed to our former muffler products and a significant number appear to involve workers in other industries or otherwise do not include sufficient information to determine whether there is any basis for a claim against us 
we believe  based on scientific and other evidence  it is unlikely that mechanics were exposed to asbestos by our former muffler products and that  in any event  they would not be at increased risk of asbestos related disease based on their work with these products 
further  many of these cases involve numerous defendants  with the number of each in some cases exceeding defendants from a variety of industries 
additionally  the plaintiffs either do not specify any  or specify the jurisdictional minimum  dollar amount for damages 
on the other hand  we are experiencing an increasing number of these claims  likely due to bankruptcies of major asbestos manufacturers 
we vigorously defend ourselves against these claims as part of our ordinary course of business 
to date  with respect to claims that have proceeded sufficiently through the judicial process  we have regularly achieved favorable resolution in the form of a dismissal of the claim or a judgment in our favor 
accordingly  we presently believe that these asbestos related claims will not have a material adverse impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
during the second quarter of  we reached an agreement with an oe customer to recover our investment in development costs and related equipment  as well as amounts owed to some of our suppliers  for a platform cancelled by the customer 
we collected million  net of the amounts we owed to suppliers  during the second quarter pursuant to this agreement 
the agreement had no effect on our results of operations 
employee stock ownership plans we have established employee stock ownership plans for the benefit of our employees 
under the plans  participants may elect to defer up to percent of their salary through contributions to the plan  which are invested in selected mutual funds or used to buy our common stock 
through december   we matched qualified contributions with a contribution of percent of each employee s contribution up to percent of the employee s salary 
beginning january   this match was reduced to percent of each employee s contribution up to percent of the employee s salary 
these matching contributions were made in common stock through december  and in cash starting january  we recorded expense for these matching contributions of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
all contributions vest immediately 
derivative financial instruments foreign currency exchange rate risk we use derivative financial instruments  principally foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year  to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our primary exposure to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans made between affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third parties 
additionally  we enter into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates on certain intercompany and third party trade receivables and payables 
we manage counter party credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with major financial institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of such agreements 
we have from time to time also entered into forward contracts to hedge our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
we do not currently enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
in managing our foreign currency exposures  we identify and aggregate existing offsetting positions and then hedge residual exposures through third party derivative contracts 
the following table summarizes by major currency the notional amounts  weighted average settlement rates  and fair value for foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts as of december  all contracts in the following table mature in december  notional amount weighted average fair value in foreign currency settlement rates in us dollars millions except settlement rates australian dollars purchase

interest rate risk our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk for changes in interest rates are our debt securities 
we primarily use a revolving credit facility to finance our short term capital requirements 
we pay a current market rate of interest on these borrowings 
we have financed our long term capital requirements with long term debt with original maturity dates ranging from six to ten years 
under the terms of our senior credit facility agreement  we were required to hedge our exposure to floating interest rates by april so that at least percent of our long term debt was fixed for a period of at least three years 
in february  we hedged million of our floating rate long term debt with three year  floating to fixed interest rate swaps 
in april  we hedged an additional million of our floating rate long term debt with three year  floating to fixed interest rate swaps 
the hedges that we executed fully satisfied the interest rate hedging requirement of the senior credit facility agreement 
the swaps expired in february and we are not required to renew them 
on december   we had million in long term debt obligations that have fixed interest rates 
of that amount  million is fixed through october  while the remainder is fixed over periods of and there is also million in long term debt obligations that have variable interest rates based on a current market rate of interest 
we estimate that the fair value of our long term debt at december  was about percent of its book value 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize in the income statement and the cash we pay for interest expense by about million after tax 
the statements and other information including the tables in this derivative financial instruments section constitute forward looking statements 
years and operating units results net sales and operating revenues change millions north america   europe   rest of world results for have been reclassified for comparability to reflect a change in how we record certain sales incentives 
effective january   we changed the way we classify some sales incentives in accordance with the may consensus reached by the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force on issue no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives 
the impact of this reclassification on results was a reduction in net sales of million with an offsetting reduction in selling  general and administrative expense 
our north american revenues decreased million in compared to reflecting lower sales generated from both our original equipment and aftermarket businesses 
oe revenues declined percent to  million in due mostly to significant oe production cutbacks in both the light and heavy duty vehicle segments as vehicle manufacturers adjusted production levels in the face of a slowing economy 
oe emissions control revenues declined percent  however  excluding a million increase in catalytic converter revenues due to increased cost of precious metals that are passed through to our customers  oe emissions control revenues declined percent 
oe ride control revenues were down percent for the year 
lower ride control volumes  especially in our heavy duty elastomer business  contributed to the decline in oe ride control revenues 
contributing to the volume reduction was a decrease in the north american light vehicle build rate from million units in to million units in  and a decline in the heavy duty vehicle build rate from  units in to  units in oe price reductions in both ride control and emissions control also contributed million to the north america revenue decrease 
aftermarket revenues were million in  representing a decline of percent from the previous year 
lower industry volumes continued to impact our north american aftermarket business 
aftermarket emissions control revenues decreased percent in  while our aftermarket ride control revenues declined percent compared to lower volumes accounted for million of the reduction in aftermarket revenues 
this was partially offset by revenues from a new large ride control customer beginning in the third quarter of price increases implemented on some products in north america in the first and second quarters of took hold and more than offset negative price adjustments that were initiated during our european segment s revenues increased million in compared to oe revenues increased percent to million in the year 
contributing to the oe revenue increase were stronger exhaust volumes  which added million of additional revenue  in both our new and existing programs 
rising precious metal prices that we have passed through to our oe exhaust customers were million of the increase 
excluding the impact of these pass through sales  oe exhaust revenues would have increased percent 
offsetting the volume increase was the devaluation of currency which reduced exhaust revenues by million 
ride control revenues were down percent year over year 
lower volumes reduced revenues by million 
also the devaluation of european currencies resulted in a reduction in oe ride control revenues of million in excluding these currency impacts  overall european oe revenues would have increased percent in compared to the prior year 
the overall european build rate was million units compared to million units in the primary reason that our european oe revenues exceeded the build rate decrease was a higher level of pass through sales in our exhaust business 
european aftermarket revenues were million in compared to million in the prior year 
this percent decline resulted from the continued softness of the aftermarket industry combined with declining exhaust replacement rates due primarily to the increasing original equipment use of longer lasting stainless steel 
price increases that related to our global aftermarket pricing strategy provided favorable results in  contributing some positive revenue growth and helping to partially offset the impact from lower volumes 
negatively impacting european aftermarket revenue was the devaluation of european currencies  which reduced revenues by million 
revenues from our operations in the rest of the world  specifically south america  australia and asia  decreased million in primarily due to the million impact of foreign currency translation 
excluding these currency impacts  total revenues for the rest of the world would have increased percent compared to the same period in the impact of foreign currency was million in south america and million in australia 
this was partially offset by strong volume growth in south america and asia 
the south america volume growth is attributable to several new oe programs 
in asia  oe volumes increased due to new platforms in production at our exhaust manufacturing facility in shanghai 
income before interest expense  income taxes  and minority interest ebit year ended december  change millions north america europe rest of world other the ebit results shown in the preceding table include the following items  discussed below  which have an effect on the comparability of ebit results between periods year ended december  millions north america restructuring charges non accruable restructuring related expenses environmental reserve europe restructuring charges non accruable restructuring related expenses amendment of senior credit facility environmental reserve rest of world restructuring charges non accruable restructuring related expenses amendment of senior credit facility other stock option buyback program transaction reserve reversal ebit for north american operations decreased to million in from million in included in these results were charges for environmental  restructuring and restructuring related activities of million and million in and  respectively 
a drop in both light and heavy duty vehicle production volumes and a decline in the higher margin elastomer business combined to reduce ebit for the north american oe business by million 
also  unfavorable pricing impacts were million and we incurred million in higher costs primarily related to engineering for new vehicle launches 
foreign currency losses  mostly attributable to declines in the canadian dollar  were million 
our restructuring actions saved million 
this was  however  more than offset by higher overhead costs 
lower selling  general and administrative overhead expenses and cost savings generated from our restructuring efforts improved ebit in our north american aftermarket business by million 
also contributing million to the aftermarket ebit increase were price increases implemented in the first and second quarters of  which more than offset negative price adjustments implemented during lower volumes resulted in a million decrease in aftermarket ebit 
additionally  we incurred increased customer changeover costs of million compared to  primarily associated with a new ride control customer 
our european segment s ebit decreased million to million in versus the prior year 
included in these results were charges for renegotiation of our senior credit facility  environmental remediation  restructuring and restructuring related activities of million and million in and  respectively 
foreign currency movements negatively impacted oe ebit by million in the period 
lower volumes and negative pricing also contributed to the reduction 
in our european aftermarket  improved pricing contributed million to ebit in  and lower selling  general and administrative expenses also generated million 
offsetting these increases were lower volumes which decreased aftermarket ebit by million 
ebit for our operations in the rest of the world increased by million in compared with the prior year 
included in these results were charges for renegotiation of our senior credit facility  restructuring and restructuring related activities of million in both and ebit for our asia operations improved due to stronger volumes in our oe exhaust operations in shanghai 
this increase was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency devaluation of million 
other in the year  includes a million charge related to a stock option buyback and a million reversal of a reserve for the transaction cost related to the november spin off of pactiv 
these items were also included in other in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item ebit as a percentage of revenue year ended december  north america europe rest of world total tenneco automotive in north america  ebit as a percentage of revenue remained flat 
production cuts by vehicle manufacturers  declines in higher margin elastomer sales  pricing pressure from vehicle manufacturers and the increase in pass through converter sales contributed to lower margins in our oe business 
in the north america aftermarket  ebit as a percentage of revenue improved due to lower selling  general and administrative expenses and increased prices 
in addition  north american ebit margins were significantly impacted by our restructuring activities in both and in europe  ebit margins decreased one percent on a percent increase in revenues 
this is due to the pass through sales  which generally have a very low margin  becoming a greater percentage of total revenues 
significant improvements in oe exhaust operations were offset by costs associated with the polish ride control plant start up  reserves for bad debt  currency impacts and lower aftermarket volumes 
additionally  our european restructuring activities have also had a significant impact on ebit margins 
ebit as a percentage of revenue for the rest of the world increased one percent year over year despite the impact of foreign currency devaluation 
stronger volumes and improved mix offset the foreign currency devaluation 
interest expense  net of interest capitalized we reported interest expense of million during  compared to million during the decrease in our total interest expense is primarily due to lower interest rates on our variable rate debt 
see more detailed explanations on our debt structure in liquidity and capital resources capitalization earlier in this management s discussion and analysis 
income taxes we recorded a tax expense during of million 
tax expense for included a million expense for repatriation of earnings from some of our foreign subsidiaries 
we took this action to better facilitate movement of cash balances among our overseas subsidiaries while minimizing cash tax payments in foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate before this charge was a percent benefit on our pre tax loss 
the primary reason that this differs from our statutory tax rate of percent is the non deductible portion of our restructuring charges 
see note to the financial statements for a reconciliation of our tax expense to the statutory rate 
we recorded a tax benefit during of million  for an effective tax rate of percent 
this benefit was higher than the statutory rate due to the consolidation of our mexican entities into one tax entity  allowing us to recognize some previously unbenefitted tax loss carryforwards in mexico  and due to the adjustment of tax liabilities in some foreign jurisdictions based on tax returns filed in the third quarter 
earnings per share losses per diluted common share were for the year ended december  compared to per diluted common share in the prior period 
included in the results for are the impacts from charges related to our restructuring plans  the tax charge for repatriation of foreign earnings  environmental remediation activities and the costs related to the amendment of certain terms of the senior credit facility in early the cumulative negative effect of these items on earnings per diluted common share was in the significant pieces of this impact were comprised of the repatriation of foreign earnings of per share and the restructuring charges taken in the first  second and fourth quarters which were per share 
included in the results for are impacts from charges related to our restructuring plans  stock option buyback program  and the reversal of the reserve for transaction costs related to the november spin off of pactiv 
the cumulative negative effect of these items on earnings per diluted common share was 
in addition  for the year ended december   we recorded an extraordinary loss of 
per diluted common share due to the early retirement of debt 
dividends on common stock during  we paid a quarterly dividend of 
per share of common stock 
dividend payments totaled million in on january   we announced that our board of directors eliminated the quarterly dividend on our common stock 
the board took the action in response to current industry conditions  primarily greater than anticipated production volume reductions by original equipment manufacturers and continued softness in the global light vehicle aftermarket 
there are no current plans to reinstate a dividend on our common stock 
cash flows year ended december  millions cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities cash provided from operating activities decreased to million in as compared to million in lower earnings in was a key driver to the decrease in cash provided 
this was partially offset by our continued focus on working capital 
reduced accounts receivable and inventory made a favorable impact on cash flows in the current period compared to the prior year 
that allowed us to use million less cash on working capital before the impact of sales of accounts receivable during compared with the prior year 
working capital  adjusted for million of receivables that were sold  was million lower than it was at the end of during  we increased the size of our european receivables securitization program by million while we saw our us receivables securitization program decline by million 
in the same period in the prior year our receivables sales programs in europe and north america provided million of cash 
we have also entered into arrangements with two major oe customers in north america under which  in exchange for a discount that is less than our marginal borrowing cost  payments for product sales are made earlier than otherwise required under existing payment terms 
these arrangements reduced accounts receivable by million as of december  included in our results is a million pension plan contribution 
no contribution was made in the prior year 
investing activities cash used by investing activities for continuing operations was million lower in the year ended december  compared to the same period in capital expenditures were million lower at million in compared to million in in  we increased our ownership percentage in a south african joint venture for million 
we also received cash proceeds of million during  primarily related to the sale of an interest in our burnley  uk exhaust facility to futaba 
we also invested million in the new joint venture 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million in the increase in was attributable to a prepayment of long term debt in also includes a million decrease in short term debt and million of dividend payments to our common shareholders
