results of operations and liquidity and capital resources raytech corporation and its subsidiaries manufacture and distribute engineered products for heat resistant  inertia control  energy absorption and transmission applications 
the company s operations are categorized into three business segments wet friction  dry friction and aftermarket 
additional information on these business segments is presented in note f segment reporting in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
raytech corporation  at december   completed its first full year of operation as the successor company post emergence from bankruptcy 
in april  raytech corporation emerged from the protection of bankruptcy court under chapter of title of the united states bankruptcy code 
raytech corporation had been under the chapter protection since march the bankruptcy history and emergence are described in more detail in note q to the consolidated financial statements 
as of april   the company adopted fresh start reporting pursuant to the guidance provided by the american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code sop 
the effective date of the company s emergence from bankruptcy was considered to be the close of business on april  for financial reporting purposes 
the periods presented prior to april  have been designated predecessor company and the periods subsequent to april  have been designated successor company 
in accordance with fresh start reporting  all assets and liabilities were recorded at their respective fair values 
the fair value of substantially all of the company s long lived assets was determined using information provided by third party appraisers 
the company has determined that the most meaningful presentation of financial information would be to provide comparative analysis of the financial performance of the successor company for the thirty nine week periods ended december  and december  this is designated below as successor company discussion and analysis 
additionally  the financial analysis detailed below provides a comparative analysis of the financial performance of the successor company for the period december  through march  compared to the predecessor company financial performance for the period january  through april  the company has also presented comparative analysis of the financial performance for the successor company for the periods april  through december  compared to the predecessor company for the period april  through december  additionally  the predecessor company financial analysis detailed below provides a comparative analysis of the financial performance of raytech corporation for the thirteen week periods ended april  and april  the adjustments relating to the recording of reorganization expenses and other fresh start adjustments for the one day period ended april  are detailed in note r to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has elected not to present a comparative analysis for the fifty two week period ended december  since such information in the prior period would require consolidating statements of the predecessor company and the successor company 
it was determined that the significance of the adjustments relating to the emergence from bankruptcy would render such an analysis not meaningful 
accounting policies the company s accounting policies are detailed in note a summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the audited financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of raytech corporation and its majority owned subsidiaries 
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the investment by third parties in allomatic products company is accounted for as minority interest in the consolidated financial statements 
there are no unconsolidated entities and raytech does not use special purpose entities spe s 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported revenue and expenses made in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates include inventory  receivable and environmental reserves  depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits  and the recoverable value of deferred tax assets 
the most significant areas involving management s judgment are described below 
accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated or if an amount is likely to fall within a range and no amount within the range can be determined to be the better estimate  the minimum amount of the range is recorded 
remediation obligations are not recorded on a discounted basis 
reimbursements from insurance carriers relating to environmental matters are not recorded until it is probable that such recoveries will be realized 
the accrual for environmental matters is discussed in this management discussion and analysis under the heading provision for environmental remediation 
pension benefits and welfare benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements 
because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments  significant estimates are required to calculate pension and welfare benefit expenses and liabilities related to the company s plans 
the company utilizes the services of independent actuaries  whose models are used to facilitate these calculations 
several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and welfare benefit expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements 
management believes the three most significant variables in the pension models are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate  and the expected rate of compensation increase 
management believes the most significant assumption in the welfare benefit model is the healthcare cost trend rate 
the actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors  including employee turnover  retirement age  and mortality 
company management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which we operate 
at december   the company had goodwill and other intangibles of million  which were recorded as a result of the fresh start accounting process in management reviews goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that its value may have declined 
in order to evaluate impairment of goodwill  assumptions about the future condition and operations of the business unit to which the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset relates are made 
using these assumptions  management determines  with the assistance of other professionals  whether an impairment charge is required to reduce goodwill to its estimated fair value 
the impairment evaluation process for other intangibles uses projected future cash flows undiscounted 
this test is performed when circumstances and events indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or grouping of assets may not be recoverable 
should undiscounted cash flows be less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment charge reducing the carrying amount to fair value is required 
management believes that the assumptions made to evaluate goodwill and other intangibles impairment are appropriate and reasonable 
however  changes in circumstances or conditions affecting these assumptions could result in impairment charges in future periods that may be material
