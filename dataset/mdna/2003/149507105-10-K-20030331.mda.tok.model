item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations industry and company outlook cavalier homes  inc and its subsidiaries are engaged in the production  sale  financing  and insuring of manufactured housing 
the manufactured housing industry is cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by many of the same economic and demographic factors that affect the housing market as a whole 
as a result of the growth in the industry during much of the s  the number of retail dealerships  manufacturing capacity and wholesale shipments expanded significantly  which ultimately created slower retail turnover  higher retail inventory levels and increased price competition 
the industry also has been impacted by an increase in dealer failures  a reduction in available consumer credit and wholesale dealer financing for manufactured housing  more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels 
the manufactured housing institute mhi reported that wholesale floor shipments were down in as compared to following significant declines during the years through as follows  and 
in response to deteriorating market conditions  manufacturers have closed or idled some of their manufacturing facilities and retail dealers have closed many locations 
a major industry lender announced  in september  plans to discontinue wholesale dealer financing of manufactured homes  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to find financing for home purchases by dealers whose floor plan financing was with that lender 
this announcement follows another major lender s withdrawal  beginning in may  from wholesale financing which did not have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to find financing for home purchases by dealers whose floor plan financing was with that lender 
the company believes that the possibility exists for additional retail dealer failures  as well as for the loss of additional lenders from the industry  further tightening of credit standards and a further reduction in the availability of wholesale and retail financing 
the current industry trend is toward more land home real estate financing rather than chattel or home only loans 
in addition  a major industry lender announced  in november  plans to discontinue chattel home only financing of manufactured homes at retail 
while land home financing generally offers more favorable credit terms to the retail buyer of manufactured housing  the length of time involved in closing land home transactions is greater 
additionally  effective january   the state of texas  which historically has been one of the largest states for consumer purchases of manufactured housing  enacted a law that  among other things  classifies and taxes manufactured homes as real property  and not personal property  under certain conditions as set forth in the texas law 
the classification as real property could change the rates and methods of taxation assessed against such homes in texas 
the law also may affect the form and structure of permanent financing extended to texas manufactured home consumers because such financing historically has treated manufactured homes as personalty rather than as real estate 
in response to the continued weakening of the manufactured housing industry market conditions in the fourth quarter of and the indeterminate impact of political tensions and armed conflict in the middle east  the company announced its decision to close six manufacturing facilities in the fourth quarter of these facilities are located in conway  arkansas  graham  texas  cordele  georgia  belmont  mississippi and haleyville  alabama 
the company will shift production from these plants  which employed approximately  people  to one or more of the company s eight operating plants 
the remaining plants will also handle dealer sales and customer service for the company s homes 
since the fall of  cavalier has reduced the number of operating home manufacturing plants from to  reflecting an approximate reduction in manufacturing capacity 
some of the closed plants had lower production capacity than the remaining operating plants 
despite this consolidation of its manufacturing facilities  the company does not believe it has reduced the breadth of its product offering 
on the retail side  the company has closed or disposed of of its retail sales centers 
in terms of operating costs  cavalier has made cost reductions in virtually all areas of the company  including its exclusive dealer and marketing programs and its administrative personnel and associated costs 
altogether  the company has had a net reduction in its production and administrative workforce of approximately  prior to the closing of home manufacturing facilities that employed approximately  individuals as announced at year end  since december  the company is continuing to evaluate capacity  cost and overhead issues  the need for further plant  retail and other consolidations  reductions  idlings and closings and methods designed to address the company s financial performance in light of developing market and business conditions 
the company can give no assurance as to which one or more of these options  if any  it may ultimately adopt  and  if adopted  whether and to what extent these actions will have an effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
as industry conditions remained challenging  the company s floor shipments remained steady  increasing in as compared to during the industry downturn  the company s market share improved from a low of for to for the company is uncertain at this time as to the extent and duration of the general economic conditions and continuing adverse industry conditions will have on the company s future revenue and earnings 
while the company currently expects losses from operations for the first quarter of  changes in general economic conditions that affect consumer purchases  availability of adequate financing sources  increases in repossessions or dealer failures could affect the results of operations of the company

cavalier attributes the overall increase in sales and floor shipments primarily to its aggressive distribution and marketing strategies and its value based product offerings 
the company s higher floor shipments for the year compared with a decline of in industry floor shipments according to mhi  demonstrating continued market share gains for the company over the past two years 
multi section home shipments  as a percentage of total shipments  increased from of shipments in to of shipments in in response to increasing consumer demand for multi section homes as compared to single section homes  caused in part by favorable changes in financing rates and terms available for multi section homes  especially for land home financing

the valuation allowance increased to  in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
realization of the deferred tax assets net of recorded valuation allowances is largely dependent upon future profitable operations and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
because the company has operated at a loss in its three most recent calendar years and because it believes difficult competitive and economic conditions may continue for the foreseeable future  the company believes that under the standards of fas no 
it is not appropriate to record income tax benefits in excess of anticipated refunds of taxes previously paid 
the valuation allowance may be reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred income tax assets are realized as a reduction of taxes otherwise payable on any future earnings or the valuation allowances are otherwise no longer required

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for years beginning after december  sfas no 
specifies that goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead will be subject to periodic impairment testing 
the company adopted sfas no

due to the change in law  the company see safe harbor statement on page received a refund of  in april and received an additional refund of approximately  in march the company s capital expenditures were  for  as compared to  for capital expenditures during these periods included normal property  plant and equipment additions and replacements and the exercise of a purchase option for a previously leased facility for  in the funding for this purchase came from an industrial development revenue bond issue 
in addition to its normal purchasing and selling of loans to other finance companies  during the company received proceeds of approximately  from the sale of loans that were previously held in its installment loan portfolio 
as of december   the company has a  revolving and term loan agreement the credit facility with the company s primary bank  whose president is a director of the company 
the credit facility contains a revolving line of credit which provides for borrowings including letters of credit of up to a maximum of  the amount available under the credit facility and applicable interest rates are based on certain levels of tangible net worth  defined as the total of the company s tangible net worth and treasury stock purchases 
at december  and   was outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
no additional borrowing capacity is available at december  see discussion below regarding new credit facility 
the maturity date under the revolving line of credit is april the term loan agreement contained in the credit facility provides for borrowings of up to of the company s eligible as defined installment sales contracts  up to a maximum of  or such lesser amount as may be available 
interest on term notes is fixed for a period of five years from issuance at a rate based on the weekly average yield on five year treasury securities averaged over the preceding weeks  plus  with a floating rate for the remaining two years subject to certain limits equal to the bank s prime rate plus 
no amounts were outstanding under the term loan portion of the credit facility at december  and the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants which  among other things  limit the company s ability without the lender s consent to i make dividend payments and purchases of treasury stock in an aggregate amount which exceeds of consolidated net income for the two most recent years  ii mortgage or pledge assets which exceed  in the aggregate   iii incur additional indebtedness  including lease obligations  which exceed in the aggregate  excluding floor plan notes payable which cannot exceed  and iv make annual capital expenditures in excess of  in addition  the credit facility contains certain financial covenants requiring the company to maintain on a consolidated basis certain defined levels of net working capital at least  debt to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed to and cash flow to debt service ratio not less than to commencing with the year ending december  and thereafter  and to maintain a current ratio of at least to and the sum of consolidated tangible net worth plus treasury stock purchases  in and  of at least  the credit facility also requires cis to comply with certain specified restrictions and financial covenants 
at december   the company was in violation of certain covenants  however  appropriate waiver letters have been obtained from the lender 
on march   the company received a commitment from its primary lender for a new credit facility 
the new credit facility is comprised of a revolving line of credit which provides for borrowings up to  and a real estate term loan component that allows for borrowings up to  this new credit facility changes certain financial covenants to be less restrictive and includes a revised borrowing base and interest rate schedule based on various levels of tangible net worth as defined 
the maturity date for the revolving line of credit remains unchanged 
the applicable interest rates under the new facility are based on certain levels of tangible net worth as noted in the following table 
tangible net worth tnw interest rate above  prime less   prime   prime plus   prime plus below  prime plus the amount available under the new facility is equal to the lesser of an amount based on defined percentages of accounts receivable and inventories or certain levels of tangible net worth as noted in the following table 
tangible net worth credit facility tnw available above  of tnw    to zero dollar for dollar reduction since its inception  cis has been restricted in the amount of loans it could purchase based on underwriting standards  as well as the availability of working capital and funds borrowed under its credit line with its primary lender 
from time to time  the company evaluates the potential to sell all or a portion of its remaining installment loan portfolio  in addition to the periodic sale of installment contracts purchased by cis in the future 
cis is currently re selling loans to other lenders under various retail finance contracts 
the company believes the periodic sale of installment contracts under these retail finance agreements will reduce requirements for both working capital and borrowings  increase the company s liquidity  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and enhance the ability of cis to increase its volume of loan purchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional sales will be made under these agreements  or that cis and the company will be able to realize the expected benefits from such agreements 
the company currently believes existing cash and funds available under the new credit facility  together with cash provided by operations  will be adequate to fund the company s operations and plans for the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances to this effect 
if it is not  or if the company is unable to remain in compliance with its covenants under its credit facility  the company would seek to maintain or enhance its liquidity position and capital resources through further modifications to or waivers under the credit facility  incurrence of additional short or long term indebtedness or other forms of financing  asset sales  restructuring of debt  and or the sale of equity or debt securities in public or private transactions  the availability and terms of which will depend on various factors and market and other conditions  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
projected cash to be provided by operations in the coming year is largely dependent on sales volume 
the company s manufactured homes are sold mainly through independent dealers who generally rely on third party lenders to provide floor plan financing for homes purchased 
in addition  third party lenders generally provide consumer financing for manufactured home purchases 
our sales depend in large part on the availability and cost of financing for manufactured home purchasers and dealers as well as our own retail locations 
the availability and cost of such financing is further dependent on the number of financial institutions participating in the industry  the departure of financial institutions from the industry  the financial institutions lending practices  see safe harbor statement on page the strength of the credit markets generally  governmental policies and other conditions  all of which are beyond our control 
a major third party lender announced  in september  plans to discontinue wholesale financing of manufactured homes  which may have a material adverse effect on cavalier s ability to find financing for dealer purchases 
reduced availability of such financing is currently having an adverse effect on the manufactured housing industry 
in addition  most states classify manufactured homes for both legal and tax purposes as personal property rather than real estate 
as a result  financing for the purchase of manufactured homes is characterized by shorter loan maturities and higher interest rates  and in certain periods such financing is more difficult to obtain than conventional home mortgages 
unfavorable changes in these factors and the current adverse trend in the availability and terms of financing in the industry may have a material adverse effect on cavalier s results of operations or financial condition 
contractual obligations and commitments dollars in thousands the following table summarizes contractual obligations of the company at december   including short and long term debt  commitments for future payments under non cancelable operating lease agreements and other long term obligations

the cost of these contingent repurchase obligations to the company was     and  
see safe harbor statement on page the company and certain of its equity partners have guaranteed certain debt for companies in which the company owns various equity interests 
the guarantees are limited to various percentages of the outstanding debt up to a maximum guaranty of  at december    was outstanding under the various guarantees  of which the company had guaranteed  one of the companies has a lease purchase agreement with a third party to sell a facility financed by debt that the company has guaranteed 
the company expects the proceeds from the exercise of the purchase option to be used to pay off the debt and to be released from the guaranty upon payoff in the company has provided letters of credit to providers of certain of its insurance policies 
while the current letters of credit have a finite life  they are subject to renewal at different amounts based on the requirements of the insurance carriers 
the company has recorded insurance expense based on anticipated losses related to these policies 
critical accounting policies cavalier follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and use historical experience factors  current economic conditions and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a list of the accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations that require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
product warranties cavalier provides the retail home buyer a one year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure  plumbing and electrical systems 
we record a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold  based upon our assessment of historical experience factors and current industry trends 
factors we use in the estimation of the warranty liability include historical sales amounts and warranty costs related to homes sold and any outstanding service work orders 
we have a reserve for estimated warranties of  and  
although we maintain reserves for such claims  based on our assessments as described above  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on cavalier s results of operations 
insurance cavalier s workmen s compensation prior to february   and after april   product liability and general liability prior to april  insurance coverages were provided under incurred loss  retrospectively rated premium plans 
under these plans  we incur insurance expense based upon various rates applied to current payroll costs and sales 
annually  such insurance expense is adjusted by the carrier for loss experience factors subject to minimum and maximum premium calculations 
refunds or additional premiums are estimated and recorded when sufficiently reliable data is available 
we were contingently liable at december  for future retrospective premium adjustments up to a maximum of approximately  in the event that additional losses are reported related to prior years 
we recorded an estimated liability of approximately  and  related to these contingent claims 
claims exceeding our current expense levels could have a material adverse effect on cavalier s results of operations 
reserve for repurchase commitments manufactured housing companies customarily enter into repurchase and other recourse agreements with lending institutions which have provided wholesale floor plan financing to dealers 
substantially all of cavalier s sales are made to dealers located primarily in the south central and south atlantic regions of the united states pursuant to repurchase agreements with lending institutions 
these agreements generally provide that we will repurchase our new products from the lending institutions in the event such product is repossessed upon a dealer s default 
the risk of loss under repurchase agreements is lessened by the fact that sales of our manufactured homes are spread over a relatively large number of independent dealers  the largest of which accounted for approximately of sales in  the price that cavalier is obligated to pay under such repurchase agreements declines based on predetermined amounts over the period of the agreement generally months and cavalier historically has been able to resell homes repurchased from lenders 
cavalier reviews the aging of retail dealers inventory to estimate the amount of inventory subject to repurchase obligation 
additionally  we review repurchase notifications received from floor plan sources and review our dealer inventory for expected repurchase notifications based on various communications from the lenders and the dealers as well as for dealers who  we believe  are experiencing financial difficulty 
we apply a historical loss factor to the inventory estimated to be repurchased 
the maximum amount for which we are contingently liable under such agreements approximated  at december  changes in the level of retail inventories in the manufactured housing industry  either up or down  can have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
for example  due to the rapid expansion of the retail distribution network in the manufacturing housing industry that occurred in much of the s  there is currently an imbalance between industry retail inventories and consumer demand for manufactured homes 
the deterioration in the availability of retail financing  along with significant competition from repossessed homes  has already extended the inventory adjustment period beyond what was originally expected 
if these trends were to continue  or if retail demand were to significantly weaken further  the inventory overhang could result in even greater intense price competition  further pressure on profit margins within the industry  and have a material adverse effect on cavalier 
the company s inventory at all retail locations  including company owned retail sales centers  declined in from and another in from levels at the end of while cavalier believes that inventories of its homes are approaching levels which are more consistent with retail demand  due in part to the company s emphasis on working with its dealers to reduce retail inventories  we cannot give investors assurances to this effect 
in spite of these efforts  significant unfavorable developments or further deterioration within the industry would undoubtedly have an adverse impact on company operating results 
we have a reserve for repurchase commitments of  and  
impairment of long lived assets since the latter part of  cavalier and the manufactured housing industry have experienced a downturn in business as discussed above 
due to deteriorating market conditions  during this time  we have idled  closed or sold manufactured housing facilities  a portion of our insurance and premium finance business  a portion of our supply operations and under performing retail locations 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  including goodwill and other intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of long lived assets is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such assets is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived assets 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner  except that the fair market values are based primarily on independent appraisals and preliminary or definitive contractual arrangements less costs to dispose 
goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued see safe harbor statement on page for years beginning after december  sfas no 
specifies that goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead will be subject to periodic impairment testing 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  under the provisions of this statement  the company recorded a charge of  net of tax  or per diluted share  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  to eliminate all of its goodwill due to impairment 
the entire amount of the goodwill was associated with the company s home manufacturing unit 
the company and the manufactured housing industry have been impacted by inventory oversupply at the retail level  an increase in dealer failures  a reduction in available consumer credit and wholesale dealer financing for manufactured housing  more restrictive credit standards and increased home repossessions which re enter home distribution channels 
all of these factors have caused the company to suffer significant losses since the last half of the fair value of the home manufacturing unit was determined by a third party valuation specialist  using projections provided by company management as well as industry and other market data
