the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during each of the fiscal years in the three year period ended december business overview we are a leading independent manufacturer and distributor of replacement parts for motor vehicles in the automotive aftermarket industry 
we are organized into two major operating segments  each of which focuses on a specific segment of replacement parts 
our engine management segment manufactures ignition and emission parts  on board computers  ignition wires  battery cables and fuel system parts 
our temperature control segment manufactures and remanufactures air conditioning compressors  and other air conditioning and heating parts 
we sell our products primarily in the united states  canada and latin america 
we also sell our products in europe through our european segment 
acquisition 
on february   we signed an agreement to purchase dana s emg business  for a purchase price equal to the closing net book value of the business  subject to a maximum purchase price of million 
dana s emg business is a leading manufacturer of aftermarket parts in the automotive industry focused exclusively on engine management 
dana s emg business manufacturers ignition systems  emission parts  engine computers  ignition wires  battery cables and fuel system parts 
customers of dana s emg business include napa auto parts  csk auto  o reilly automotive and pep boys 
we intend to integrate dana s emg business into our engine management segment within months from the closing of the acquisition 
the closing of the acquisition is subject to our financing of the purchase price 
we intend to finance the acquisition and the payment of related fees and expenses and restructuring and integration costs by a drawing on our revolving credit facility  b issuing shares of our common stock and c obtaining seller financing 
the acquisition purchase price is subject to a post closing adjustment based upon the book value of the acquired assets of dana s emg business less the book value of the assumed liabilities of dana s emg business as of the close of business on the closing date 
the acquisition is subject to our obtaining financing for the acquisition and other customary closing conditions 
we expect to close the acquisition during the second quarter of customers 
we distribute our products through a variety of distribution channels  including wholesale distributors  retail chains  service chains and original equipment dealers 
our warehouse distribution channel represents of our consolidated net sales for the year ended december  our retail channel of distribution has grown significantly from approximately million in consolidated net sales to retailers in representing of consolidated net sales to approximately million in representing of consolidated net sales  and to approximately million in representing of consolidated net sales 
in  we commenced distributing our products through the original equipment service supplier channel  and sold approximately million in consolidated net sales to original equipment service suppliers representing of consolidated net sales  which increased to approximately million in representing of consolidated net sales 
our five largest individual customers accounted for of our consolidated net sales 
members of one marketing group represent our largest group of customers and accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales 
one individual member of this marketing group accounted for of our consolidated net sales 
seasonality 
historically  our operating results have fluctuated by quarter  with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment 
it is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest  specifically in the temperature control segment of our business 
in addition to this seasonality  the demand for our temperature control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather 
for example  a cool summer may lessen the demand for our temperature control products  while a hot summer may increase such demand 
as a result of this seasonality and variability in demand of our temperature control products  our working capital requirements peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received 
during this period  our working capital requirements are typically funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility 
the seasonality of our business offers significant operational challenges in our manufacturing and distribution functions 
to limit these challenges and to provide a rapid turnaround time of customer orders  we traditionally offer a pre season selling program  known as our spring promotion  in which customers are offered a choice of a price discount or longer payment terms 
inventory management 
we instituted an aggressive inventory reduction campaign initiated in we targeted a minimum million inventory reduction in  but exceeded our goal by reducing inventory by million that year 
importantly  while reducing inventory levels  we maintained customer service fill rate levels of approximately 
in  we further reduced inventory by additional million 
we face inventory management issues as a result of warranty and overstock returns 
many of our products carry a warranty ranging from a day limited warranty to a lifetime limited warranty  which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet industry published specifications 
in addition to warranty returns  we also permit our customers to return products to us within customer specific limits in the event that they have overstocked their inventories 
in particular  the seasonality of our temperature control segment requires that we increase our inventory during the winter season in preparation of the summer selling season and customers purchasing such inventory have the right to make returns 
in order to better control warranty and overstock return levels  beginning in we tightened the rules for authorized warranty returns  placed further restrictions on the amounts customers can return and instituted a program so that our management can better estimate potential future product returns 
in addition  with respect to our air conditioning compressors  our most significant customer product warranty returns  we established procedures whereby a warranty will be voided if a customer does not follow a twelve step warranty return process 
comparison of fiscal years and sales 
on a consolidated basis  net sales for increased by million over to million 
this net increase was driven by a million increase in engine management  year over year 
new business was the primary contributor with gains achieved in the retail business where certain customers expanded their own business  new wire and cable business acquired from an existing customer  and new original equipment customers acquired through our acquisition of sagem inc in may of with respect to temperature control  net sales for decreased by million to million 
net sales were unfavorable due to a combination of a partial loss in business with a significant retail customer in  net sales including approximately million of pipeline orders for a new customer which did not repeat in  and distributors working off inventory left over from previous mild summer seasons 
gross margins 
gross margins  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  increased to in from in the improvement in gross margins reflects the return in to more normal production levels  as the aggressive and successful inventory reduction campaign in benefited  in both of our major segments 
engine management gross margins improved approximately percentage points  while temperature control improved approximately percentage points 
gross margins also benefited from a decrease in warranty returns in both engine management and temperature control 
overall  warranty returns improved by approximately percentage point  as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling general and administrative expenses increased to million or of net sales in  from million or of net sales in contributing to the increase was approximately million of restructuring costs related to the consolidation of certain manufacturing and distribution facilities within the temperature control segment 
also contributing to the overall increase was higher insurance and employee benefit costs 
goodwill 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill will no longer be amortized  but instead  will be subject to an annual review for potential impairment 
using the discounted cash flows method  based on our weighted average cost of capital and market multiples  we reviewed the fair values of each of our reporting units 
the recent decline in economic and market conditions  higher integration costs than anticipated and the general softness in the automotive aftermarket has caused a decrease in the fair values of certain of our reporting units 
as a result  we recorded an impairment loss on goodwill as a cumulative effect of accounting change of million  net of tax  or per diluted share during the first quarter of the impairment loss relates to goodwill pertaining to certain of our reporting units within our european segment and our temperature control segment and we recorded charges of million related to our european segment and million related to our temperature control segment 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its review of goodwill for potential impairment 
after giving consideration to losses in europe and budgeted losses  the company wrote off the remaining goodwill associated with engine management reporting unit of the european segment 
with respect to the european segment  approximately million of goodwill remains on the december  balance sheet  all of which pertains to the temperature control  reporting unit 
other income 
other income  net increased approximately million over contributing to the increase was the elimination of fees related to an accounts receivable sales arrangement eliminated in april of interest expense 
interest expense decreased by approximately million  as compared contributing to overall decrease was lower borrowings during total debt was reduced approximately million and lower interest rates 
income taxes 
the overall effective tax rate increased from in to in the significant increase is primarily the result of the operating losses in our european segment  for which no income tax benefit has been recorded because it is more likely than not that such losses will not be realized in the near future 
supplementing the effect europe had on the effective rate is the increase in the company s domestic earnings as a percentage of overall earnings before taxes 
loss on discontinued operations 
loss on discontinued operations reflect the charges associated with asbestos  including legal expenses 
as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company is responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
based on the information contained in the september actuarial study  which estimated an undiscounted liability for settlement payments ranging from million to million and all other available information considered by the company  and as further set forth in such note  the company recorded an after tax charge of million as a loss from discontinued operation during the third quarter of to reflect such liability 
the company concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments was more likely than any other and  therefore  recorded the low end of the range as the liability associated with future settlement payments through in the company s consolidated financial statements  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
total legal expenses associated with asbestos related matters totaled million in comparison of fiscal years and sales 
after giving consideration to the adoption of emerging issues task force guidelines entitled accounting for certain sales incentives and vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  consolidated net sales in were million  a decrease of million compared to consolidated net sales of million in the decrease in consolidated net sales was a result of decreases in our existing traditional business lines and higher costs for adding a new customer 
the decrease was mitigated by the engine management segment  which benefited from a full year of sales to the new major customer added during the third quarter of with incremental sales of approximately million in  along with additional wire set business from a major group of warehouse distributors 
the temperature control segment regained a major retail customer we had lost in early this customer accounted for consolidated net sales of approximately million in  excluding filling the initial pipeline of orders from such customer 
excluding this new business  sales to existing accounts decreased  primarily a result of another cool summer for air conditioning  and the continuing inventory reduction program on the part of many of our customers 
gross margins 
gross margins  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  decreased to in  from in gross margins in our engine management segment were in compared to in gross margins in our temperature control segment were in compared to in the decrease in gross margins was primarily due to our planned inventory reduction programs 
the reduction in gross margins was across all product lines as we originally targeted a minimum million inventory reduction in actual inventory reduction amounted to million  while we maintained high customer service fill levels 
these changes reflect the impact of underabsorbed overhead costs as a result of cutting production and temporarily closing manufacturing facilities at both engine management and temperature control facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in  compared to million in this decrease reflected the focus on our cost reduction efforts  with benefits primarily in the marketing and distribution areas in our temperature control division 
income from operations 
operating income decreased by million compared to  primarily due to the lower gross margins as discussed above 
other income expenses  net 
other income  net increased by million compared to the increase was primarily due to the reduction of fees related to the termination of the sale of accounts receivable agreement and an increase in interest and dividend income 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased slightly by million in compared to  due to lower interest rates and lower average borrowings 
income tax provision 
income tax expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to overall lower earnings 
the effective tax rate increased from in to in the increase was primarily due to a decrease in earnings from our foreign subsidiaries  which have lower tax rates than the united states statutory rate 
impact of inflation although inflation is not a significant issue  management believes it will be able to continue to minimize any adverse effect of inflation on earnings through cost reduction programs  including the sale of manufactured products  and  where competitive situations permit  selling price increases 
future results of operations we continue to face competitive pressures 
in order to sell at competitive prices while maintaining profit margins we are continuing to focus on overhead and cost reductions 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
during the year ended december   cash provided by operations amounted to million  compared to million in and cash used in operations of million in the improvement in was primarily attributable to our efforts to reduce inventory levels from their elevated levels of december  the improvement in is primarily attributable to improved earnings from continuing operations  higher accounts payable and continued reductions in inventory 
for the year ended december   inventory decreased by an addition million over the million reduction in  which resulted primarily from reduced production and purchases  and where needed  the temporary closing of manufacturing facilities 
reductions were realized in both the engine management and temperature control segments 
inventory turnover was x in  x in  and x in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the increase was primarily due to acquisitions  partially offset by decreases in capital expenditures 
assets acquired consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  receivables and inventory 
all acquisitions were financed with funds provided under our revolving credit facility and seller financing 
in january  we acquired the assets of a temperature control business from hartle industries for million 
the assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  and inventory 
in april  we acquired carol cable limited  a manufacturer and distributor of wire sets based in the united kingdom  for approximately million 
the assets from this acquisition consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  and inventory 
in addition  during  the company paid approximately an additional million for the remaining equity interest in smp holdings limited 
in may  we purchased the aftermarket fuel injector business of sagem inc  a subsidiary of johnson controls  for million 
sagem inc is a basic manufacturer of fuel injectors and was our primary supplier prior to the acquisition 
assets acquired from this acquisition consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  and inventory 
the purchase was partially financed by the seller million to be paid over a two year period  with the remaining funds being provided under our revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures for the three most recent fiscal years ended december totaled million in  million in and million in financing activities 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the increase in cash used was primarily due to our focus on reducing our borrowings 
dividends paid for the three most recent fiscal years ended december were million in  million in and million in the decreased borrowings reflect our focus on reducing capital employed in the business 
effective april  we entered into an agreement with general electric capital corporation  as agent  and a syndicate of lenders for a new secured revolving credit facility 
the term of the new credit agreement was for a period of five years and provided for a line of credit up to million 
the company recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately million  net of taxes  in the second quarter of  for a prepayment penalty and write off of unamortized fees for the retirement of the above related debt 
on february   we amended our revolving credit facility to provide for an additional million commitment  subject to the terms and conditions therein  which will become effective upon the closing of our acquisition of dana s emg business 
this additional commitment increases the total amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility to million 
in addition  in order to facilitate the aggregate financing of the acquisition  we are planning on issuing approximately million of common stock in a public offering which will occur in connection with the closing of the acquisition 
after applying all of the net proceeds from the public offering of our common stock to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility  we intend to borrow the entire cash portion of the purchase price of dana s emg business from our revolving credit facility upon the closing of the acquisition 
availability under our revolving credit facility is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and eligible fixed assets  and will include the purchased assets of dana s emg business 
we expect such availability under the revolving credit facility  following the initial draw down at the acquisition closing  to be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and integration costs 
direct borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin as defined or the libor rate plus the applicable margin as defined  at our option 
borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets  and those of our domestic and canadian subsidiaries 
our credit facility prior to the acquisition provides for certain financial covenants limiting our capital expenditures and requiring us to maintain a certain tangible net worth at the end of each fiscal quarter 
as of december   we were in compliance with our applicable financial covenants 
following our acquisition of dana s emg business  the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for  among other provisions  new financial covenants requiring us  on a consolidated basis  to maintain specified levels of ebitda at the end of each fiscal quarter for the month period then ended  through june   to fall within specified levels of a fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter for the month period then ended  and to limit capital expenditure levels for each fiscal year through our profitability and working capital requirements are more seasonal due to the sales mix of our temperature control products 
our working capital requirements usually peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales  and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received 
these increased working capital requirements are funded by borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
we anticipate that our present sources of funds will continue to be adequate to meet our needs for the next several years 
during the years through  our board of directors authorized multiple repurchase programs under which we could repurchase shares of our common stock 
during such years  an aggregate of million of common stock was repurchased to meet present and future requirements of our stock option programs and to fund our employee stock option plan 
as of december   we had board authorization to repurchase additional shares at a maximum cost of million 
during the years ended december  and  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock 
in july  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
the swaps effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt under the revolving credit facility to a fixed rate  without exchanging the notional principal amounts 
at december   we had two outstanding interest rate swap agreements in an aggregate notional principal amount of million  one of which matured in january and one of which is scheduled to mature in january under these agreements  we receive a floating rate based on the libor interest rate  and pay a fixed rate of on a notional amount of million and on a notional amount of million 
if  at any time  the swaps are determined to be ineffective  in whole or in part  due to changes in the interest rate swap agreements  the fair value of the portion of the interest rate swap determined to be ineffective will be recognized as gain or loss in the statement of operations for the applicable period 
on july   we issued our convertible debentures  payable semi annually  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the debentures are convertible into  shares of our common stock  and mature on july  the proceeds from the sale of the debentures were used to prepay an senior note  reduce short term bank borrowings and repurchase a portion of our common stock 
the following is a summary of our contractual commitments associated with our debt and lease obligations as of december  year ended december  in thousands thereafter total principal payments of long term debt      operating leases        interest rate swap agreements   total commitments        critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to our consolidated annual financial statements on this annual report on form k 
preparation of our consolidated annual and quarterly financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we can give no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales of replacement parts for motor vehicles  from both our engine management and temperature control segments 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to customers 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is generally determined on the first in  first out basis 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined at the reporting unit level and are based upon the inventory at that location taken as a whole 
these estimates are based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
we also evaluate inventories on a regular basis to identify inventory on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current and future projected market demand 
for inventory deemed to be obsolete  we provide a reserve on the full value of the inventory 
inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates our estimate of future demand 
sales returns and other allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
at december   the allowance for sales returns totaled million 
similarly  our management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts and for discounts totaled million 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
with respect to goodwill  we test for potential impairment in the fourth quarter of each year as part of our annual budgeting process 
we review the fair values of each of our reporting units using the discounted cash flows method and market multiples 
retirement and postretirement medical benefits 
each year we calculated the costs of providing retiree benefits under the provisions of sfas and sfas the key assumptions used in making these calculations are disclosed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligation  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
we select discount rates commensurate with current market interest rates on high quality  fixed rate debt securities 
the expected return on assets is based on our current review of the long term returns on assets held by the plans  which is influenced by historical averages 
the medical cost trend rate is based on our actual medical claims and future projections of medical cost trends 
asbestos reserve 
the company is responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
a september actuarial study estimated a liability for settlement payments ranging from million to million 
the company concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments was more likely than any other and  therefore  recorded the low end of the range as the liability associated with future settlement payments through in the company s consolidated financial statements  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company plans on performing a similar annual actuarial analysis during third quarter of each year for the foreseeable future 
based on this analysis and all other available information  the company will reassess the recorded liability  and if deemed necessary  record an adjustment to the reserve  which will be reflected as a loss or gain from discontinued operations 
legal expenses associated with asbestos related matters are expensed as incurred 
other loss reserves 
we have numerous other loss exposures  such as environmental claims  product liability and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment of risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities for loss 
recently issued accounting announcements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations statement no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
statement no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  we will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
we are required and plan to adopt the provisions of statement no 
for the quarter ending march  to accomplish this  we must identify all legal obligations for asset retirement obligations  if any  and determine the fair value of these obligations on the date of adoption 
the determination of fair value is complex and will require us to gather market information and develop cash flow models 
additionally  we will be required to develop processes to track and monitor these obligations 
the adoption of statement no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections statement no 

statement no 
eliminates the automatic classification of gain or loss on extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item of income and requires that such gain or loss be evaluated for extraordinary classification under the criteria of accounting principles board apb no 
 reporting results of operations 
statement no 
also requires sales leaseback accounting for lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sales leaseback transactions  and makes various other technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
statement no 
will be effective for the year ending december  the adoption of statement no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements  however  it will require prior periods to be reclassified for any loss on extinguishment of debt not meeting the criteria of apb no 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associates with exit or disposal activities statement no 

statement no 
 which is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   applies to costs associated with an exit activity  including restructurings  or with a disposal of long lived assets 
those activities can include eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
statement no 
requires that exit or disposal costs are recorded as an operating expense when the liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
commitment to an exit plan or a plan of disposal by itself will not meet the requirement for recognizing a liability and the related expense under statement no 
statement no 
grandfathers the accounting for liabilities that were previously recorded under eitf issue we do not believe the adoption of statement no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others interpretation 
this interpretation elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair market value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not believe the adoption of this interpretation will have a material effect on our financial statements 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of product warranty claims 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  we do not believe the adoption of statement no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  for public enterprises with a variable interest in a variable interest entity created before february   the interpretation applies to that enterprises no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  the application of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
the interpretation requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after january  if it is reasonably possible that we will consolidate or disclose information about variable interest entities when the interpretation becomes effective 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
these exposures are actively monitored by management 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs  revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiary s functional currency 
similarly  we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing 
it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate risk we have exchange rate exposure  primarily  with respect to the canadian dollar and the british pound 
as of december   our financial instruments which are subject to this exposure are immaterial  therefore the potential immediate loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 
this sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable fluctuation in both of the exchange rates affecting both of the foreign currencies in which the indebtedness and the financial instruments described above are denominated and does not take into account the offsetting effect of such a change on our foreign currency denominated revenues 
interest rate risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt in our debt portfolio 
to manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements 
at december   we had approximately million in loans and financing outstanding  of which approximately million bear interest at fixed interest rates and approximately million bear interest at variable rates of interest 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments 
as a result of our refinancing agreement during the second quarter  as described in the notes to our consolidated annual financial statements  our percentage of variable rate debt to total debt has increased from at december  to at december  and decreased to at december  depending upon the level of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which may at times approach million  the effect of a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate may have approximately million negative impact on our earnings or cash flows
