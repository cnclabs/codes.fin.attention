table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing  known circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its product at the point of purchase  which occurs when the customer vends the water and pays for the product 
due to the fact that the company has approximately  vending machines  it is impractical to visit all machines at the end of each reporting period 
consequently  the company estimates the revenue from the last time each machine was visited until the end of the reporting period  based on the most current daily volume of each machine 
for the years ended december  and december   the company recorded approximately  of such estimated revenues  which represents an average of approximately days per machine 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  provides guidance on the application of existing generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company believes that its revenue recognition policy is consistent with the guidance and is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records account receivable for revenues generated by inside machine 
such revenues are collected by the retailers and remitted to the company 
the company provides a reserve against receivables for estimated losses that may result from a retailer s inability to pay 
the company determines the amount of the reserve by analyzing uncollected accounts  aged receivables  historical losses and the retailer s credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
should a retailer s account become past due  the company works with the retailer to resolve the past due amounts including replacing non coin operated machines with coin operated machines and placing the account on hold or other actions as necessary to resolve the past due amounts 
trade accounts receivable totaled  and the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at december  this allowance is consistent with historical amounts reserved by the company 
repair parts inventory repair parts inventory is stated at the lower of cost moving weighted average or market replacement 
management reviews the parts inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage 
the likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent on future machine repairs or new machine developments 
repair parts inventory was valued at  at december valuation of goodwill in  statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  goodwill was no longer subject to amortization 
in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform an annual review for impairment 
goodwill is considered to be impaired if it is determined that its carrying value exceeds its fair value 
in addition to the annual review  an interim review is required if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying value 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires the company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of the company 
the company has completed its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill as of december  and has determined that no impairment existed as of that date 
the net book value of goodwill totaled  
table of contents depreciable useful lives property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the asset 
vending equipment is estimated to have a useful life of to years and is generally depreciated to a salvage value 
the salvage value is an estimate of the replacement value of the components expected to be recovered upon disposal of the machine 
when an original component is replaced  the replacement cost is expensed which results in a charge to income in an amount which approximates the depreciable cost of the components 
costs associated with installing vending equipment are capitalized and depreciated over five years  which is the normal contractual period with the retailers 
other equipment  furniture and fixtures have an estimated useful life of five to ten years 
leasehold improvements are given an estimated useful life of the shorter of its estimated life or the term of the lease 
all maintenance  repair and refurbishment costs are charged to operations as incurred 
additions and major improvements are capitalized 
costs associated with the assembly of vending machines are accumulated until finished machines are ready for installation at a retail location  at which time the costs are transferred to property and equipment 
valuation of long lived assets the company periodically assesses long lived assets for impairment  which requires the use of assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
the assets are considered to be impaired if it is determined that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon an assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operation and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership of the asset  significant changes in the strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset  the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends  and or any volatility or significant decline in the company s stock price and market capitalization compared to its net book value the company evaluates and assesses its long lived assets for impairment under the guidelines of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  the company bases the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on its estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used 
at december   the net book value of identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization totaled  and the net book value of property and equipment total litigation from time to time  claims are made against the company in the ordinary course of business 
with the assistance from legal counsel  estimated amounts for such claims that are probable and can reasonably be estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation 
on december   the company reported that an action had been brought against the company by the environmental law foundation alleging unlawful and fraudulent business practices and false advertising 
as of december   the company does not believe that this claim or any other litigation will have a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
valuation of deferred income taxes valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized

table of contents seasonality the company s revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations with decreased revenues during rainy or cold weather months and increased revenues during hot weather months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company s outstanding bank debt is tied to the bank s prime lending rate and as such  the company is at risk due to increases in market rates 
a ten percent change in the bank s lending rate would have the potential of increasing the interest on the expected average outstanding borrowings of the bank debt and impacting the future earning of the company by less than  annually 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the opportunity cost of fixed rate obligations associated with the trust preferred securities 
the company believes that the fixed rate represents the company s long term market rate 
therefore  there is no significant opportunity cost associated with the fixed rate 
at december   the company held a portfolio of marketable securities consisting entirely of debt instruments available for sale with an estimated fair value equal to  as of december   the company held no convertible debt securities or equity securities available for sale 
the company s entire portfolio is invested by kayne anderson capital advisors  lp  primarily in fixed rate corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities
