item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and factors affecting our business and prospects this form k contains forward looking statements regarding our business and future prospects 
these statements contain language such as believe  expect  anticipate  and other such language regarding various aspects of our business 
investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and several factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements 
the following is a description of some of the factors that may cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 
new products and technological change the technology industry is characterized by continuing improvements in technology and rapidly evolving industry standards 
consequently  short product life cycles and significant price fluctuations are common 
product transitions present challenges and risks for all companies involved in the data video projector market 
demand for our products and the profitability of our operations may be adversely affected if we fail to effectively manage a product transition 
advances in product technology require continued investment in research and development and product engineering to maintain our market position 
there are no guarantees that such investment will result in the right products being introduced to the market at the right time 
reliance on suppliers and contract manufacturers we rely on third party manufacturers for a significant portion of our product components 
reliance on suppliers raises several risks  including the possibility of defective parts  reduced control over the availability and delivery schedule for parts  and the possibility of increases in component costs 
our manufacturing efficiencies and profitability can be adversely affected by each of these risks 
certain components used in our products are now available only from single sources 
the most important of these components are the digital microdevices dmd s manufactured by texas instruments 
an extended interruption in the supply of dmd s would adversely affect our results of operations 
we also purchase other single source components for which we have no guaranteed alternative source of supply  and an extended interruption in the supply of any of these components could adversely affect our results of operations 
furthermore  many of the components used in our products are purchased from suppliers located outside the united states 
trading policies adopted in the future by the united states or foreign governments could restrict the availability of components or increase the cost of obtaining components 
any significant increase in component prices or decrease in component availability could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  over the course of we have outsourced a significant portion of the manufacturing of our projectors to flextronics in malaysia and to funai electric company in china 
during the fourth quarter of  on a combined basis  flextronics and funai manufactured approximately of our projectors 
during the first half of  we are transitioning all remaining manufacturing offshore 
the risks mentioned above related to reliance on suppliers will also impact our contract manufacturers 
in addition  we are reliant on our contract manufacturers ability to maintain suitable manufacturing facilities  train manufacturing employees  manage the supply chain effectively  manufacture a quality product  and provide spare parts in support of our warranty and customer service obligations 
failure of our contract manufacturers to deliver in any one of these areas could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
general economic and industry conditions our revenues have been adversely impacted by the current economic slowdown  and a continued decline in economic conditions could further depress corporate capital spending for products like ours 
these poor economic conditions could in turn lead to substantial decreases in our sales and revenues 
in addition  the financial condition of certain of our customers has weakened in the current economic environment resulting in an increase in the amount of bad debt expense recorded during we continue to monitor the financial health of our customer base in an effort to reduce our risk regarding collection of accounts receivable balances  but there is no guarantee we will not be negatively impacted by further bad debts in the future 
competition the markets for our products are highly competitive  and we expect aggressive price competition to continue into the foreseeable future 
some of our current and prospective competitors have or may have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  and marketing resources than us 
our ability to compete depends on factors within and outside our control  including the success and timing of product introductions  product performance and price  product distribution  and customer support 
in order to compete effectively and return to profitability  we must continue to reduce the cost of our products  our manufacturing overhead  and our operating expenses in order to offset recent declines in gross margins  while at the same time drive our products into new markets to expand our revenue base 
in addition  we are focusing more effort on turnkey solutions through the use of software  service and support to differentiate the company 
there is no assurance we will be able to compete successfully with respect to these factors 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results our customers generally order products for immediate delivery and  therefore  manufacturing activities are scheduled according to a monthly sales and production forecast rather than on the receipt of product orders 
from time to time in the past  we have experienced significant variations between actual orders and our forecasts 
if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenditures and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and our operating results for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  would be adversely affected 
in addition  certain of our products have lower gross margins  and a shift of product mix toward lower margin products could adversely affect profitability 
international activities sales outside the united states accounted for approximately of our revenues in the success and profitability of our international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including local economic and labor conditions  political instability  unexpected changes in the regulatory environment  trade protection measures  tax laws  and foreign currency exchange rates 
results of operations compared to revenues total revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in revenue is attributable to continued softness in business technology spending and a weaker economy  significant competitive pricing pressure due to an industry oversupply situation  and the addition of competition from taiwanese manufacturers 
revenues in the americas declined percent in compared to  and decreased percent in europe and percent in asia for the same period 
units increased approximately percent in compared to  while average selling prices decreased percent for the same period 
increases in units sold were primarily in the education and government markets and were offset by decreases in units sold to businesses 
the significant decrease in average selling prices resulted from aggressive pricing behavior due to the competitive nature of our industry fueled by a general industry oversupply situation 
during  revenues generated geographically were percent in the us  percent in europe  percent in asia and percent in the rest of the world 
during  revenues generated geographically were percent in the us  percent in europe  percent in asia and percent in the rest of the world 
at december   we had backlog of approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  given current supply and demand estimates  it is anticipated that a majority of the current backlog will turn over by the end of the first quarter of the stated backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period nor is a backlog any assurance that we will realize a profit from filling the orders 
the uncertainties of the current economic environment  both in the us and abroad  make it difficult to estimate revenues in the near term 
forecasts for corporate technology spending around the world are not optimistic in the near term 
assuming no significant changes in the economy  geopolitical environment  supply line flows or exchange rates  we anticipate the historical seasonal trend patterns to continue into the first quarter of  where revenues typically come down moderately from fourth quarter levels 
over the last couple of years  competitive pricing in the market has been particularly aggressive in the first quarter due to the year end push of many of our export dependent asian competitors 
despite the difficult economic environment  we are focused on growing our share of the market both domestically and internationally 
as a result  we are expanding our product offerings for both business and home entertainment markets and are beginning to offer these products through retail partners directly to consumers 
we believe both the professional and home markets offer good long term growth prospects and that they will be key in establishing a solid presence in retail in addition to our traditional distribution channels 
in addition  in and early  we announced two partners who agreed to purchase our newly available engines for rear projection televisions 
this development validates our technology leadership in dlp based projection and offers us the potential to grow revenues in new markets in the future and further reduce the cost of key components used in both front and rear projection applications through increased economies of scale 
lastly  during this downturn in corporate spending  we are focusing our efforts on growing our educational revenues as there is a growing demand domestically and abroad as government funds flow towards technology upgrades in schools 
while we are focusing on continued growth of our revenues on multiple fronts  no assurances can be given that we will ultimately be successful 
gross profit gross profit  as a percentage of revenue  decreased to percent in compared to percent in we achieved gross margins of percent in the fourth quarter of the decrease in is due to average selling prices declining faster than we could reduce our material costs  higher air freight costs as more of our products were shipped from our asian contract manufacturers  and higher warranty costs due primarily to higher warranty activity experienced on certain products for specifically identified design or manufacturing issues 
in addition  during  we recorded million in inventory reserves for raw materials due to product transitions  engineering change orders  excess customer service parts  and inventory write downs on remanufactured products  consistent with our lower of cost or market methodology  compared to a charge of million in in  we continued the process of shifting more production off shore to flextronics 
in addition  in october  we announced a co development and manufacturing agreement with funai electric company  at their china manufacturing facility 
funai is a leading consumer electronics company that specializes in the manufacturing and distribution of high quality  high volume  low cost electronics products  such as vcrs  dvd players and printers 
outsourced production increased to percent of total units manufactured in the fourth quarter of compared to percent in the fourth quarter of we anticipate that percent of our manufacturing will be outsourced to our contract manufacturers by the second quarter of accordingly  flextronics and funai will be directly sourcing a majority of the components with their asian suppliers 
in an effort to reduce our freight costs  we intend to begin shipping a portion of the finished goods from flextronics and funai via ocean carriers rather than by air in we expect the competitive pricing environment to continue to put pressure on gross margins during we believe fully leveraging the purchasing power of our contract manufacturers  reducing our remaining internal overhead costs  improving the quality of our products  and moving towards ocean freight will allow us to reduce costs of goods sold in in addition  as we ramp the production of our rear screen engine business in the second half of  we expect to further reduce the cost of key components used in both front and rear projection applications through increased economies of scale 
we also anticipate a reduction in our warranty costs as a result of improvements in our design  manufacturing  and reverse logistics processes 
the timing of the cost and price reductions may not coincide during the year  causing variations in our quarterly gross margin results 
operating expenses marketing and sales expense decreased to million percent of revenue in compared to million percent of revenue in the decrease in dollars spent is primarily a result of lower marketing incentives paid to customers as a result of the lower revenues  lower employee related costs due to our restructuring actions in and and savings realized from the streamlining of our channel structure 
the increase as a percent of revenue is primarily a result of lower revenues in compared to we expect sales and marketing expense to remain at approximately the same level in terms of absolute spending during research and development expense increased to million percent of revenue in from million percent of revenue in research and development expenditures in primarily related to the development of new products  including several platforms launched at flextronics during the year  as well as our home entertainment  networking  and wireless initiatives 
our research and development spending also reflects our initiative to design and produce rear projection engines for large screen digital televisions 
the increase in research and development expenditures as a percent of revenue is primarily a result of lower revenues in compared to we are committed to continuing to invest in research and development to solidify our position as the innovative market leader  specifically in home entertainment  wireless  networking and easiest to use products 
we expect that the amount spent on research and development expense will decrease in compared to as we leverage more capabilities of our contract manufacturers 
general and administrative expense increased to million percent of revenue in from million percent of revenue in general and administrative expense in includes charges for bad debts of million caused by deterioration of certain customers financial condition compared to million in the majority of the bad debt charges for were limited to a few specific customers 
we continue to closely monitor our customers credit worthiness 
despite economic conditions  we have improved days sales outstanding from days at december  to days at december  and our aging of customer accounts has also improved in the same period 
general and administrative expense in also increased due to charges related to the implementation of our oracle i accounting system in the us and europe 
the increase as a percent of revenue is a result of the increased expense in conjunction with lower revenues in compared to excluding the impact of bad debts  if any  we expect that general and administrative expenses will decline in as we gain operational efficiencies due to the new worldwide oracle i accounting system 
during the second quarter of  we announced a restructuring plan related to the migration of additional production offshore and the streamlining of our sales and marketing activities 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced additional plans related to completing our transition to percent outsourced manufacturing and to streamline our european operations by centralizing our financial operations and our service and support functions 
accordingly  we recorded restructuring charges of million in  primarily for employee severance costs and costs related to the abandonment of leased space 
accruals relating to this restructuring charge totaled million at december  and consisted primarily of severance accruals and future payments due under office space leases no longer being utilized 
merger and restructuring related costs were million in  and represent costs incurred with the consolidation of our global supply chain  including distribution  logistics and service operations  which are directly related to our business combination with proxima asa in june the charges also represent costs for streamlining our us sales and marketing organization and increasing our manufacturing outsourcing initiative with flextronics 
accruals relating to this restructuring charge totaled million at december  and consisted of future payments under an office space lease no longer being utilized 
goodwill amortization was million in goodwill amortization ceased in the first quarter of upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   resulting in the elimination of goodwill amortization of approximately million in however  in accordance with sfas no 
 we tested our goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of the market value of our common stock declined below its book value during  and remained below book value as of december  under sfas no 
 these facts indicated the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet was impaired 
accordingly  we recorded a goodwill charge of million in the fourth quarter of and as of december   we did not have any goodwill remaining on our balance sheet 
other income expense interest income decreased to million in compared to million in due to lower interest rates during compared to in addition  the average maturity of our investment portfolio decreased in compared to  resulting in lower yields 
other expense of million in includes a million loss on foreign currency transactions and a write down of million related to certain cost based investments in technology companies 
other income of  in includes a gain on sale of marketable equity securities of million and foreign currency transaction gains of million  offset by a charge of million for the write down of certain investments in technology companies in the fourth quarter of income taxes the net income tax provision of million in includes a carryback benefit for our operating loss  offset by a million charge to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the us at december  in accordance with sfas no 
after the valuation allowance  our net deferred tax asset balance  both short term and long term  was million at december  and relates to foreign jurisdictions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more details concerning our income tax provision for we anticipate our tax rate to be approximately percent in before consideration of any effects that may result from a change in our valuation allowance 
we believe that the impact of inflation was minimal in and compared to revenues total revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to slowing demand due to weakening economic conditions  which impacted corporate capital spending 
us generated revenues declined percent in compared to  while revenues increased percent in europe for the same period 
unit sales increased percent  while average selling prices decreased percent in compared to the decrease in the average selling prices was mainly due to competitive pricing pressures resulting from the economic downturn 
included in revenue in is million related to a license agreement with pixelworks  inc pixelworks 
during  sales outside of the united states represented percent of total revenue  compared to percent in gross profit gross profit  as a percentage of revenue  decreased to percent in compared to percent in we achieved gross margins of percent in the fourth quarter of the gross profit percentage for  excluding the pixelworks license fee revenue  was percent 
the decrease in the gross profit percentage in compared to is primarily due to reductions in average selling prices  which were partially offset by shifts in product mix to higher margin new products  continued component cost reductions and savings realized by consolidation of our distribution and logistics facilities around the world 
in addition  in order to take advantage of additional material cost reductions from our japanese based suppliers due to the weakening of the yen  during we increased our mix of polysilicon based products compared to dlp based products  which are sourced from a supplier in the us during the second quarter of  we began a contract manufacturing arrangement with flextronics  a singapore based corporation 
we had approximately percent of our total fourth quarter units manufactured by flextronics 
operating expenses marketing and sales expense was relatively flat at million percent of revenue in compared to million percent of revenue in decreases in co op advertising expenses were offset by increases in direct advertising and the home entertainment initiative 
the increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily a result of lower revenues in compared to research and development expense increased to million percent of revenue in from million percent of revenue in during  we continued to invest in research and development  including the ramping of new product introductions and our wireless  networking and home entertainment initiatives 
the increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily a result of lower revenues in compared to general and administrative expense decreased to million percent of revenue in from million percent of revenue in the decrease was primarily due to an approximately million decrease in bad debt expense  primarily due to a significant customer bankruptcy that occurred in  and approximately million in savings due to reductions in staffing and related expenses 
the increase as a percentage of revenue is a result of lower revenues in compared to merger and restructuring related costs were million in  and represented costs incurred with the consolidation of our global supply chain  including distribution  logistics and service operations  which are directly related to our business combination with proxima asa in june in addition  we streamlined our us sales and marketing organization and increased our manufacturing outsourcing initiative with flextronics 
merger related costs of million in include primarily investment banking fees  merger advisory fees and integration costs directly related to our business combination with proxima asa  which was completed in june goodwill amortization was million in both and income from operations decreased to million percent of revenue in compared to million percent of revenue in the decrease in is primarily the result of lower revenues and gross margin percentages 
other income expense interest income decreased to million in compared to million in due to lower investment yields during consistent with the overall decline in us interest rates during other income of  in included a gain on sale of marketable equity securities of million and foreign currency transaction gains of million  offset by a charge of million for the write down of certain investments in technology companies in the fourth quarter of due to the economic downturn and other investment specific events  the decline in value of certain investments in emerging technology companies was determined to be permanent 
accordingly  we recorded impairment losses of million on our investments in private emerging technology companies in the fourth quarter of other income of million in included a million gain on the sale of marketable equity securities 
income taxes income taxes for the year ended december  were recorded at an effective rate of percent  which decreased from percent in the decrease was primarily due to a higher mix of earnings attributable to foreign operations  particularly norway  where our tax rate was lower than in the us in addition  certain one time merger costs in were not deductible for tax purposes 
overall  we have been able to reduce our effective tax rate as a result of sustainable tax consolidation benefits derived from our merger with proxima 
we believe that the impact of inflation was minimal in and liquidity and capital resources total cash and marketable securities  including long term marketable securities  were million at december  at december   we had working capital of million  which included million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term marketable securities 
the current ratio at december  and was to and to  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents increased million in to million at december  as a result of million provided by operations  net maturities of million of marketable securities and million provided by the exercise of common stock options  offset by million used for the purchase of property and equipment  million used for acquisitions and million used primarily for patents and other long term technology investments in third parties 
accounts receivable decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in accounts receivable is primarily due to decreased revenues in compared to and improved collections in days sales outstanding were days at december  compared to days at december  inventories increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  note to the consolidated financial statements summarizes the components of inventory as of these dates 
the increase in inventory was primarily due to increased finished goods associated with the ramp up of new products  and the build up of safety stock to cover the transition period to flextronics for our remaining products during the first quarter of we expect to see a decrease in raw materials and wip inventory as we complete our transition to contract manufacturing 
this decline may be offset by an increase in finished goods inventory as we begin shipping our products using ocean freight 
annualized inventory turns were approximately times for the quarters ended december  and income taxes receivable of million at december  relates to the carry back of our taxable losses in order to get a refund of taxes paid in prior years 
we anticipate receiving a tax refund within the next months 
outsourced manufacturer receivables decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  due primarily to flextronics directly procuring a greater percentage of the raw materials for production of our products 
we expect this balance to further decline as we complete our transition to outsourced manufacturing 
accounts payable increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  primarily due to increased inventory purchases late in the fourth quarter of marketing incentives payable decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  primarily due to lower revenues in compared to we had no goodwill as of december  compared to million at december  due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of as further explained above and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
expenditures for property and equipment totaled million in and primarily included purchases of new product tooling  engineering design and test equipment and information systems infrastructure software  specifically our oracle i implementation 
offsetting these purchases was the retirement of million in fully depreciated assets  primarily tooling  leasehold improvements  computer equipment and software and furniture and fixtures 
total expenditures for property and equipment are expected to be between and million in  primarily for product tooling  continued information systems development  and network and equipment upgrades 
we anticipate that our current cash and marketable securities  along with cash anticipated to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
seasonality given the buying patterns of various geographies and market segments  our revenues are subject to certain elements of seasonality during various portions of the year 
historically  percent of our revenue has come from europe and  as such  we typically experience a seasonal downturn due to the vacation season in mid summer  which results in our revenues from that region  and overall  to be down in the third quarter compared to the second quarter 
conversely  we typically experience a strong resurgence of revenue from europe in the fourth quarter 
this  coupled with a strong buying season in the fourth quarter by larger wholesale distribution partners  typically leads to our strongest revenues being in the fourth quarter of each year 
in addition  we sell our products into the education and government markets which typically see seasonal peaks in the third quarter of each year 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  for additional information 
allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivables credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer to initiate and modify their credit limits 
we obtain credit insurance for certain accounts that qualify for coverage in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
we also record reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers 
in certain situations  if an account is determined to be a bad debt we may also use collection agencies to work with the customer for payment for a fee 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could materially change 
our allowance for uncollectible accounts totaled million at december  inventory reserves we regularly evaluate the realizability of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements and new product introductions  as well as other factors 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
raw materials and work in progress with quantities in excess of forecasted usage are reviewed at least quarterly by our engineering and operating personnel for obsolescence 
such raw material and work in progress write downs are typically caused by engineering change orders or product end of life adjustments in the market 
finished goods are reviewed at least quarterly by product marketing and operating personnel to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices 
service inventory is systematically reserved for based on the estimated remaining service life of the inventory 
we record reserves for inventory based on the above factors and take into account worldwide quantities and demand in our analysis 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the realizability of inventory could materially change 
at december   our inventory reserves totaled million 
allowance for sales returns and other deductions from revenue some distributor and dealer agreements allow for partial return of products and or price protection under certain conditions within limited time periods 
such return rights are generally limited to a contractually defined short term stock rotation and defective or damaged product 
we maintain a reserve for sales returns and price adjustments based on historical experience and other qualitative factors 
we also have incentive programs for dealers and distributors whereby rebates are offered based upon exceeding a percentage of quarterly and annual volume goals 
estimated sales returns  price protection and rebates are netted against revenue 
historical return rates are monitored monthly on a product by product basis 
as new products are introduced  these historical rates are used to establish initial sales returns reserves and are adjusted as better information becomes available 
we also regularly monitor and track channel inventory with our significant customers 
variability in channel inventory levels from quarter to quarter are further used to qualitatively adjust our returns reserves 
typically  most returns occur within days of shipment and return rates have averaged in a relatively tight range of percent to percent of sales to customers who are granted such rights 
if a dramatic change in the rate of returns were to occur  our estimate of the sales return accrual could change significantly 
one of the factors we consider in estimating future returns is the sell through of products by our distributors and dealers  particularly those whom we offer limited return rights 
we have controls in place to monitor channel inventory levels with these customers 
we believe the risk of return increases when inventory held by any customer exceeds their near term needs 
accordingly  we defer recognition of revenue on certain channel inventory estimated to be in excess of days 
our reserve for sales returns and price protection totaled million at december  historically  our actual experience for sales returns  price protection and rebates has not differed materially from our estimates 
product warranties we evaluate our obligations related to product warranties on a quarterly basis 
we offer a standard two year warranty and  for certain customers  a three year warranty 
we monitor failure rates on a product category basis through data collected by our manufacturing sites  factory repair centers and authorized service providers 
the service organizations also track costs to repair each unit 
costs include labor to repair the projector  replacement parts for defective items and freight costs  as well as other costs incidental to warranty repairs 
any cost recoveries from warranties offered to us by our suppliers covering defective components are also considered 
this data is then used to calculate the accrual based on actual sales for each projector category and remaining warranty periods 
for new product introductions  our quality control department estimates the initial failure rates based on test and manufacturing data and historical experience for similar platform projectors 
if circumstances change  or a dramatic change in the failure rates were to occur  our estimate of the warranty accrual could change significantly 
revenue generated from sales of extended warranty contracts is deferred and amortized to revenue over the term of the extended warranty coverage 
deferred warranty revenue at december  totaled million and is included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
our warranty accrual at december  totaled million and is included as accrued warranty and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and nol carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is unlikely  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
we recorded a valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets as of december  long lived asset impairment long lived assets and intangible assets with determinable lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of the future cash flows we expected the assets to generate 
our current review indicates that no adjustments are necessary for our long lived assets 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources in the future  which could result in an impairment of long lived assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial market risk arises from fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates 
our net investment exposure in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates at december   was approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately million at december  the company has no plans of liquidating any of its foreign subsidiaries  and therefore  foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not reduce our reported net income 
we are exposed to changes in exchange rates through the purchase of production materials and the sale of products denominated in non functional foreign currencies 
we have established a foreign currency derivative program  utilizing foreign currency forward contracts forward contracts to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency transactions are substantially offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
we do not use forward contracts as speculative instruments for trading purposes 
the effect of an immediate percent change in our foreign currency forward contracts would not have a material effect on our operating financial results 
the table below summarizes  by major currency  the contractual amounts of our forward exchange contracts in us dollars as of december  the bought amounts represent the net us dollar equivalents of commitments to purchase foreign currencies  and the sold amounts represent the net us dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies 
the foreign currency amounts have been translated into a us dollar equivalent value using the exchange rate at the reporting date 
forward contracts outstanding at december  mature in days or less as of december  in thousands foreign currency bought sold euro  british pound  japanese yen  swedish krona  norwegian kroner  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we mitigate this risk by diversifying investments among high credit quality securities in accordance with our investment policy 
as of december   our investment portfolio included marketable debt securities of million and marketable equity securities of million 
the debt securities are subject to interest rate risk  and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations
