introduction we are the leading convenience store operator in the southeastern united states and the third largest independently operated convenience store chain in the country based on store count with  stores in ten states as of december  our stores offer a broad selection of merchandise  gasoline and ancillary products and services designed to appeal to the convenience needs of our customers 
our strategy is to continue to improve upon our position as the leading convenience store operator in the southeastern united states by generating profitable growth through merchandising initiatives  sophisticated management of our gasoline business  upgrading our stores  leveraging our geographic economies of scale  benefiting from the favorable demographics of our markets and continuing to selectively pursue opportunistic acquisitions 
during fiscal  we focused on several initiatives we believe will continue to help maximize the performance of our existing store network and position our company for continued improvement in financial results 
in the merchandise segment  we completed our store reset program  which we began during fiscal  introduced our candy lane sm aisle and began the conversion of many of our store banners to kangaroo express sm 
we also rolled out our celeste private label beverage line and deli express sandwich program to all locations 
we believe these initiatives have improved our gross margin and contributed to a increase in comparable store merchandise revenue for fiscal  despite unusually wet weather throughout the southeast and significant retail price deflation in our cigarette category 
in the gasoline segment  we began our brand consolidation project  which we believe will enable us to provide a more consistent operating identity while helping us in our efforts to maximize our gasoline gallon growth and gross profit dollars 
to date  we have completed the gasoline conversions and or image upgrades related to the branding and supply agreements at a total of locations  including stores to bp amoco  stores to citgo and stores to our kangaroo private brand format 
all of these stores have also been converted to kangaroo express sm branding for their merchandise operations 
over the two year conversion period  we anticipate that a total of approximately  stores will be converted or re imaged to kangaroo express sm on the merchandise side and converted and or re imaged to bp amoco  citgo or kangaroo on the gasoline side 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed a million refinancing of our senior secured credit facility 
this refinancing provided us greater liquidity and flexibility through a million increase in the revolving credit facility to a total of million and a million reduction of scheduled principal payments through fiscal subsequent to september   we entered into amendments to our senior credit facility to increase the borrowings under the first lien term loan by million and to increase the revolving credit facility to million 
during fiscal  we closed underperforming locations 
historically  the stores we close are underperforming in terms of volume and profitability  and  generally  we benefit from closing the locations by reducing direct overhead expenses and eliminating certain fixed costs 
on october   we completed the acquisition of convenience stores operating under the golden gallon banner from ahold  usa  inc this acquisition included stores in tennessee and stores in northwest georgia and enhances our strong regional presence  increasing our store count to  stores as of december  the aggregate purchase price was million 
the acquisition included the purchase of certain real estate assets fee owned stores  financed through a million sale leaseback transaction and the purchase of the golden gallon operations and the balance of the real estate assets fee owned stores  corporate headquarters building and certain undeveloped properties for approximately million in cash  financed with million of existing cash and million of debt through borrowings under our amended senior secured credit facility 
the acquired assets also included a dairy plant and related assets and a fuel hauling operation  which we subsequently sold to two of our existing suppliers

liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations 
due to the nature of our business  substantially all sales are for cash and cash provided by operations is our primary source of liquidity 
we rely primarily upon cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary from time to time by borrowings under our revolving credit facility  sale leaseback transactions  and asset dispositions to finance our operations  pay interest and principal payments and fund capital expenditures 
cash provided by operations for fiscal totaled million  for fiscal totaled million and for fiscal totaled million 
our increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to the increase in gasoline and merchandise gross profit and its impact on operating income and ebitda 
we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at september  capital expenditures 
gross capital expenditures excluding all acquisitions for fiscal were million 
our capital expenditures are primarily expenditures for store improvements  store equipment  new store development  information systems and expenditures to comply with regulatory statutes  including those related to environmental matters 
we finance substantially all capital expenditures and new store development through cash flow from operations  proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and asset dispositions and vendor reimbursements 
our sale leaseback program includes the packaging of our owned convenience store real estate  both land and buildings  for sale to investors in return for their agreement to lease the property back to us under long term leases 
we retain ownership of all personal property and gasoline marketing equipment 
our leases are generally operating leases at market rates with lease terms between fifteen and twenty years plus several renewal option periods 
the lease payment is based on market rates applied to the cost of each respective property 
our senior credit facility limits or caps the proceeds of sale leasebacks that we can use to fund our operations or capital expenditures 
we received million in proceeds from sale leaseback transactions in fiscal and million during fiscal in fiscal  we had proceeds of million including asset dispositions million  vendor reimbursements million and sale leaseback transactions million

the net cash used was primarily the result of scheduled principal payments totaling million and financing costs associated with the refinancing of our senior credit facility totaling million 
this decline was partially offset by new borrowings under our senior credit facility 
at september   our long term debt consisted primarily of million in loans under our senior credit facility and million of our senior subordinated notes 
see contractual obligations and commitments for a summary of our long term debt principal amortization commitments 
senior credit facility 
on april   we entered into a new senior secured credit facility  which consisted of a million first lien term loan  a million second lien term loan and a million revolving credit facility  each maturing march  proceeds from the new senior secured credit facility were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the previous senior credit facility and loan origination costs 
the term loans were issued with an original issue discount of million  which will be amortized over the life of the agreement 
as of september   our outstanding term loan balance  net of unamortized original issue discount  was million 
subsequent to september   we entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility to increase the borrowings under the first lien term loan by million 
the proceeds from the term loan were used to fund the golden gallon acquisition 
also  subsequent to september   we increased the availability under our revolving credit facility by million to million 
our senior credit facility bears interest at variable interest rates 
the credit facility permits us to choose between two basic rates for a given loan a rate based on the greater of the prime rate of interest in effect on the day the loan is made or the federal funds rate in effect on the day the loan is made plus of and an additional margin  as described below  or a rate based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus an additional margin as described below 
the actual interest rate we pay depends on whether the loan is a first lien term loan  a second lien term loan or a revolving credit loan 
the credit facility requires us to pay  in addition to the basic interest rate  an annual margin ranging from to  depending on the type of loan involved 
we have from time to time entered into certain hedging agreements in an effort to mitigate the fluctuations in interest rates and manage our interest rate risk  and anticipate that we will continue to use hedging agreements for these purposes in the future 
our senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  other than our leased real property  and guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
our senior credit facility contains covenants restricting our ability and the ability of any of our subsidiaries to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock  prepay  redeem or purchase debt  incur liens  make loans and investments  make capital expenditures  engage in mergers  acquisitions  asset sales or sale leaseback transactions  and engage in transactions with affiliates 
our senior credit facility also contains financial ratios and tests that must be met with respect to minimum fixed charge and leverage ratios  minimum pro forma ebitda and maximum capital expenditures 
as of december   we have satisfied all financial ratios and tests under our senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility requires us to maintain minimum consolidated pro forma leverage ratios on a sliding scale ranging from a high of to to a low of to over quarterly periods between april  and march  and thereafter  maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to on a quarterly basis  maintain minimum consolidated pro forma ebitda for the trailing four quarters  of million quarters through march   million quarters through december  and million thereafter  and limit consolidated capital expenditures in fiscal to million and for fiscal years after to million plus unspent amounts that are permitted to be carried forward from prior fiscal years up to a limit of of the previous year s dollar limit 
the senior credit facility limits us to paying aggregate consideration of  for any acquisition 
in addition  the senior credit agreement includes customary events of default  including upon a change of control 
under the credit agreement  a change of control occurs if among other things a any person other than a permitted holder our current largest stockholder holds more than of the voting power of our common stock unless the permitted holder owns a greater percentage than such person or b permitted holders hold less than of our common stock or c a change of control as defined by the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes occurs 
our million revolving credit facility is available to fund working capital  finance general corporate purposes and support the issuance of standby letters of credit 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited by our outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
furthermore  the revolving credit facility limits our total outstanding letters of credit to million 
as of september   we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility  we had approximately million in available borrowing capacity and million of standby letters of credit were issued under the facility 
we are required to prepay the loans under the credit facility with a the net cash proceeds of most debt issuances  b of the net cash proceeds received by us from any issuance of capital stock  c the net cash proceeds of asset sales unless the proceeds are reinvested in the business and d of excess cash flow beginning with the fiscal quarter ending december senior subordinated notes 
we have outstanding million of senior subordinated notes due october  interest on the senior subordinated notes is due on october and april of each year 
our senior subordinated notes contain covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and any restricted subsidiary s ability to pay dividends  make distributions or repurchase stock  except a in amounts not in excess of the sum of of our net income and of the net cash proceeds of equity issuances or issuances of convertible debt which has been converted and b in amounts not in excess of million  issue stock of subsidiaries  make investments in non affiliated entities  incur liens not securing debt permitted under the senior subordinated notes  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale leaseback transactions  or engage in mergers or consolidations 
we can incur debt under the senior subordinated notes if the ratio of our pro forma ebitda to fixed charges  after giving effect to such incurrence  is at least to even if we do not meet this ratio we can incur debt under our bank credit facility in an amount not to exceed a up to million for acquisitions plus b the greater of million or times our annualized revenues  capital leases or purchase money debt in amounts not to exceed in the aggregate of our tangible assets at the time of incurrence  intercompany debt  debt existing on the date the senior subordinated notes were issued  up to million in any type of debt  or debt for refinancing of the above described debt  so long as such debt is subordinated to the senior subordinated notes to the same extent as the debt refinanced and meets certain other requirements 
the senior subordinated notes also place conditions on the terms of asset sales or transfers and require us either to reinvest the cash proceeds of an asset sale or transfer  or  if we do not reinvest those proceeds  to pay down our senior credit facility or other senior debt or to offer to redeem our senior subordinated notes with any asset sale proceeds not so used 
in addition  upon the occurrence of a change of control  we will be required to offer to purchase all of the outstanding senior subordinated notes at a price equal to of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
under the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes  a change of control is deemed to occur if among other things a any person  other than a permitted holder our current largest stockholder  becomes the beneficial owner of or more of our common stock or b any person becomes the owner of more than of our common stock and the permitted holders own a lesser percentage of our company than such other person and do not have the right or ability to elect a majority of the board 
the senior subordinated notes may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at a redemption price that is currently and decreases to after october and after october shareholders equity 
as of september   our shareholders equity totaled million 
the increase of million in shareholders equity from september  is primarily attributable to fiscal net income of million and a decrease of million in accumulated other comprehensive deficit related to the fair value changes in our qualifying derivative financial instruments 
long term liquidity 
we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and funds available from our existing revolving credit facility  together with cash on hand and vendor reimbursements  will provide sufficient funds to finance our operations at least for the next months 
changes in our operating plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses  additional acquisitions or other events may cause us to need to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods 
there can be no guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
additional equity financing could be dilutive to the holders of our common stock  debt financing  if available  could impose additional cash payment obligations and additional covenants and operating restrictions 
we have no current plans to seek any such additional financing

the following table shows our expected long term debt amortization schedule  future capital lease commitments including principal and interest and future operating lease commitments as of september  fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total dollars in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations on october   we increased our borrowings under our senior credit facility by million 
the annual principal obligations on the increased borrowings are million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal letter of credit commitments 
the following table shows the expiration dates of our standby letters of credit issued under our senior credit facility as of september  fiscal fiscal total dollars in thousands standby letters of credit environmental considerations 
environmental reserves of million and million as of september  and september   respectively  represent our estimates for future expenditures for remediation  tank removal and litigation associated with and known contaminated sites  respectively  as a result of releases eg  overfills  spills and underground storage tank releases and are based on current regulations  historical results and certain other factors 
we estimate that approximately million of our environmental obligations will be funded by state trust funds and third party insurance 
our environmental reserve  dated as of september   does not include the golden gallon sites that were known to be contaminated at the time of our october acquisition of golden gallon 
state trust funds  insurers or other third parties are responsible for the costs of remediation at all golden gallon sites 
also  as of september  and september  there were an additional and sites  respectively  that are known to be contaminated and that are being remediated by third parties and therefore  the costs to remediate such sites are not included in our environmental reserve 
florida environmental regulations require all single walled underground storage tanks to be upgraded replaced with secondary containment by december  in order to comply with these florida regulations  we will be required to upgrade or replace underground storage tanks at approximately locations 
we anticipate that these capital expenditures will be approximately million and will begin during fiscal the ultimate costs incurred will depend on several factors including future store closures  changes in the number of locations upgraded or replaced and changes in the costs to upgrade or replace the underground storage tanks 
merchandise supply agreement 
we have a distribution service agreement with mclane pursuant to which mclane is the primary distributor of traditional grocery products to our stores 
we also purchase a significant percentage of the cigarettes we sell from mclane 
the agreement with mclane continues through october  and contains no minimum purchase requirements 
we purchase products at mclane s cost plus an agreed upon percentage  reduced by any promotional allowances and volume rebates offered by manufacturers and mclane 
in addition  we received an initial service allowance  which is being amortized over the term of the agreement  and also receive additional per store service allowances  both of which are subject to adjustment based on the number of stores in operation 
total purchases from mclane exceeded of total merchandise purchases in fiscal gasoline supply agreements 
we have historically purchased our branded gasoline and diesel fuel under supply agreements with major oil companies  including bp  chevron  citgo  shell  mobil and texaco 
the fuel purchased has generally been based on the stated rack price  or market price  quoted at each terminal 
the initial terms of these supply agreements range from three to ten years and generally contain minimum annual purchase requirements as well as provisions for various payments to us based on volume of purchases and vendor allowances 
these agreements also  in certain instances  give the supplier a right of first refusal to purchase certain assets that we may want to sell 
we have met our purchase commitments under these contracts and expect to continue to do so 
we purchase the majority of our private branded gallons from citgo 
during february  we signed new gasoline supply agreements with both bp and citgo to brand and supply most of our gasoline products for the next five years 
after a conversion of approximately locations over the next months we expect that bp will supply approximately of our total gasoline volume  which will be sold under the bp amoco brand 
citgo will supply both our private brand gasoline  which will be sold under our own kangaroo and other brands  and citgo branded gasoline 
including our private brand gasoline  we expect that after the month conversion period  citgo will supply approximately of our total gasoline volume 
the remaining locations  primarily in florida  will remain branded and supplied by chevron 
we entered into these branding and supply agreements to provide a more consistent operating identity while helping us in our efforts to maximize our gasoline gallon growth and gasoline gross profit dollars 
other commitments 
we make various other commitments and become subject to various other contractual obligations which we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the business 
management believes that such routine commitments and contractual obligations do not have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  like all public companies  we expect that we may face slightly increased costs in order to comply with new rules and standards relating to corporate governance and corporate disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules 
we intend to devote all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards 
quarterly results of operations and seasonality the following table sets forth certain unaudited financial and operating data for each fiscal quarter during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal the unaudited quarterly information includes all normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown 
this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
due to the nature of our business and its reliance  in part  on consumer spending patterns in coastal  resort and tourist markets  we typically generate higher revenues and gross margins during warm weather months in the southeastern united states  which fall within our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
in the following table  dollars are in thousands  except per gallon data 
fiscal fiscal fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total revenue merchandise revenue gasoline revenue commission income gross profit merchandise gross profit gasoline gross profit commission income income from operations income loss before cumulative effect income from operations as a percentage of full year comparable store merchandise sales increase decrease comparable store sales gasoline gallons increase decrease merchandise gross margin as a percentage of total revenue gasoline gross profit per gallon inflation during fiscal  wholesale gasoline fuel prices remained volatile  hitting a high of approximately per barrel in march and a low of approximately per barrel in november generally  we pass along wholesale gasoline cost changes to our customers through retail price changes 
gasoline price volatility has had an impact on total revenue  gross profit dollars and gross profit percentage 
general cpi  excluding energy  increased during fiscal and food at home cpi  which is most indicative of our merchandise inventory  increased similarly 
while we have generally been able to pass along these price increases to our customers  we can make no assurances that continued inflation will not have a material adverse effect on our sales and gross profit dollars 
recently adopted accounting standards effective december   we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  or eitf eitf requires that certain cash consideration received by a customer from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products or services and should  therefore  be characterized as a reduction of cost of sales when recognized in the customer s income statement 
however  that presumption is overcome if certain criteria are met 
if the presumption is overcome  the consideration would be presented as revenue if it represents a payment for goods or services provided by the reseller to the vendor  or as an offset to an expense if it represents a reimbursement of a cost incurred by the reseller 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our results of operations or classification of expenses 
effective december   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas no 
 which requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
effective september   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
requires us to recognize an estimated liability associated with the removal of our underground storage tanks 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note asset retirement obligations for a discussion of our adoption of sfas no 
effective september   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and accounting principles board no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
effective september   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
rescinds fasb statement no

sfas no 
also rescinds and amends other existing authoritative pronouncements

and  thus  the exception to applying apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  or opinion  to all gains and losses related to extinguishments of debt 
as a result  gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in opinion see notes to consolidated financial statements note long term debt for our discussion on our debt extinguishment 
effective september   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  or sfas no 
 an amendment of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
sfas no 
was issued to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we are following the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
in our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation  or fin   guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  or fin this interpretation addresses the disclosure requirements for guarantees and indemnification agreements entered into by an entity 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the entity ie  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under the guarantee 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after december  the provisions of fin for initial recognition and measurement are to be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the guarantor s previous accounting for guarantees that were issued before initial application of fin are not required to be revised or restated to reflect the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas no 
 to provide clarification on the meaning of an underlying derivative  the characteristics of a derivative that contains financing components and the meaning of an initial investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  in addition  all provisions of sfas no 
should be applied prospectively 
the provisions of sfas no 
that relate to statement implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to june   should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  or sfas no 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
some of the provisions of sfas no 
are consistent with the current definition of liabilities in fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   thus we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
for our fourth quarter beginning june  the adoption of this sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 or fin this interpretation provides guidance related to identifying variable interest entities previously known as special purpose entities or spes and determining whether such entities should be consolidated 
certain disclosures are required if it is reasonably possible that a company will consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity when it initially applies fin this interpretation will be effective for our first quarter beginning september  we have no investment in or contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and therefore the adoption of fin will not have any impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
however  if we enter into any such arrangement with a variable interest entity in the future or an entity with which we currently have a relationship is reconsidered based on guidance in fin to be a variable interest entity  our results of operations and financial condition will be impacted 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those polices may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
environmental liabilities and related receivables 
we account for the cost incurred to comply with federal and state environmental regulations as follows environmental reserves reflected in the financial statements are based on internal and external estimates of costs to remediate sites relating to the operation of underground storage tanks 
factors considered in the estimates of the reserve are the expected cost and the estimated length of time to remediate each contaminated site 
deductibles and remediation costs not covered by state trust fund programs and third party insurance arrangements  and for which the timing of payments can be reasonably estimated  are discounted using a ten percent discount rate 
reimbursement under state trust fund programs or third party insurers are recognized as receivables and a provision for uncollectible reimbursements is recorded based on historical and expected collection rates 
our historical collection experience exceeds 
all recorded reimbursements are expected to be collected within a period of twelve to eighteen months after submission of the reimbursement claim 
the adequacy of the liability and uncollectible receivable reserve is evaluated quarterly and adjustments are made based on updated experience at existing sites  newly identified sites and changes in governmental policy 
changes in laws and government regulation  the financial condition of the state trust funds and third party insurers and actual remediation expenses compared to historical experience could significantly impact our statement of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition 
revenues from our three primary product categories  gasoline  merchandise and commissions  are recognized at the point of sale 
we derive commission income from lottery ticket sales  money orders  car washes  public telephones  amusement and video gaming and other ancillary product and service offerings 
vendor allowances and rebates 
we receive payments for vendor allowances  volume rebates and other supply arrangements in connection with various programs 
payments are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales or expenses to which the particular payment relates 
unearned payments are deferred and amortized as earned over the term of the respective agreement 
long lived assets and closed stores 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when an evaluation is required  the projected future undiscounted cash flows due to each store are compared to the carrying value of the long lived assets of that store to determine if a write down to fair value is required 
property and equipment of stores we are closing are written down to their estimated net realizable value at the time we close such stores 
if applicable  we provide for future estimated rent and other exit costs associated with the store closure  net of sublease income  using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining rent payments on closed stores 
we estimate the net realizable value based on our experience in utilizing or disposing of similar assets and on estimates provided by our own and third party real estate experts 
changes in real estate markets could significantly impact the net realizable value from the sale of assets and rental or sublease income 
insurance liabilities 
we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation and employee medical programs 
accrued liabilities have been recorded based on our estimates of the ultimate costs to settle incurred and incurred but not reported claims 
our accounting policies regarding self insurance programs include judgments and actuarial assumptions regarding economic conditions  the frequency and severity of claims  claim development patterns and claim management and settlement practices 
significant changes in actual expenditures compared to historical experience rates as a result of increased medical costs or incidence rates could significantly impact our statement of operations and financial position 
goodwill impairment 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 which requires allocating goodwill to each reporting unit and testing for impairment using a two step approach 
based on our current reporting structure  we have determined that we operate as one reporting unit and therefore have assigned goodwill at the enterprise level 
fair value is measured using a valuation based on market multiples  comparable transactions and discounted cash flow methodologies 
the goodwill impairment test is performed annually or whenever an event has occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
should the enterprise carrying value exceed the estimated fair market value we would have to perform additional valuations to determine if any goodwill impairment exists 
any impairment recognized will be recorded as a component of operating expenses 
changes in the long term economics of the gasoline and convenience store markets  fluctuations in capital markets and competition could impact our fair value measurements which could significantly impact our statement of operations and financial position 
derivative financial instruments 
we enter into interest rate swap and collar agreements to modify the interest characteristics of our outstanding long term debt and we have designated each qualifying instrument as a cash flow hedge 
we formally document our hedge relationships  including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction 
at hedge inception  and at least quarterly thereafter  we assess whether derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the hedged item 
we measure effectiveness by the ability of the interest rate swaps to offset cash flows associated with changes in the variable libor rate associated with our term loan facilities using the hypothetical derivative method 
to the extent the instruments are considered to be effective  changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
to the extent there is any hedge ineffectiveness  any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in earnings as interest expense 
when it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting  and subsequent changes in fair value of the hedge instrument are recognized in earnings 
the fair values of our interest rate swaps and collars are obtained from dealer quotes 
these values represent the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the agreement taking into account the difference between the contract rate of interest and rates currently quoted for agreements of similar terms and maturities 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making a decision to invest in our securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition in the future 
if any of such risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our securities could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our industry the convenience store industry is highly competitive and impacted by new entrants 
the industry and geographic areas in which we operate are highly competitive and marked by ease of entry and constant change in the number and type of retailers offering the products and services found in our stores 
we compete with other convenience store chains  gasoline stations  supermarkets  drugstores  discount stores  club stores and mass merchants 
in recent years  several non traditional retailers  such as supermarkets  club stores and mass merchants  have impacted the convenience store industry by entering the gasoline retail business 
these non traditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the motor fuels market and their market share is expected to grow 
in some of our markets  our competitors have been in existence longer and have greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond better to changes in the economy and new opportunities within the industry 
to remain competitive  we must constantly analyze consumer preferences and competitor s offerings and prices to ensure we offer a selection of convenience products and services consumers demand at competitive prices 
we must also maintain and upgrade our customer service levels  facilities and locations to remain competitive and drive customer traffic to our stores 
major competitive factors include  among others  location  ease of access  gasoline brands  pricing  product and service selections  customer service  store appearance  cleanliness and safety 
volatility of wholesale petroleum costs could impact our operating results 
in each of the past three fiscal years  our gasoline revenue accounted for approximately of total revenues and our gasoline gross profit accounted for approximately of total gross profit 
crude oil and domestic wholesale petroleum markets are marked by significant volatility 
general political conditions  acts of war or terrorism  and instability in oil producing regions  particularly in the middle east and south america  could significantly impact crude oil supplies and wholesale petroleum costs 
in addition  the supply of gasoline for our private brand locations and our wholesale purchase costs could be adversely impacted in the event of a shortage as our gasoline contracts do not guarantee an uninterrupted  unlimited supply of gasoline 
significant increases and volatility in wholesale petroleum costs could result in significant increases in the retail price of petroleum products and in lower gasoline gross margin per gallon 
increases in the retail price of petroleum products could impact consumer demand for gasoline 
this volatility makes it extremely difficult to predict the impact future wholesale cost fluctuations will have on our operating results and financial condition 
these factors could materially impact our gasoline gallon volume  gasoline gross profit and overall customer traffic  which in turn would impact our merchandise sales 
wholesale cost increases of tobacco products could impact our merchandise gross profit 
sales of tobacco products have averaged approximately of our total revenue over the past three fiscal years 
significant increases in wholesale cigarette costs and tax increases on tobacco products  as well as national and local campaigns to discourage smoking in the united states  may have an adverse effect on unit demand for cigarettes domestically 
in general  we attempt to pass price increases on to our customers 
however  due to competitive pressures in our markets  we may not be able to do so 
these factors could materially impact our retail price of cigarettes  cigarette unit volume and revenues  merchandise gross profit and overall customer traffic 
changes in consumer behavior  travel and tourism could impact our business 
in the convenience store industry  customer traffic is generally driven by consumer preferences and spending trends  growth rates for automobile and truck traffic and trends in travel  tourism and weather 
changes in economic conditions generally or in the southeast specifically could adversely impact consumer spending patterns and travel and tourism in our markets 
approximately of our stores are located in coastal  resort or tourist destinations 
historically  travel and consumer behavior in such markets is more severely impacted by weak economic conditions 
if visitors to resort or tourist locations decline due to economic conditions  changes in consumer preferences  changes in discretionary consumer spending or otherwise  our sales could decline 
risks related to our business unfavorable weather conditions or other trends or developments in the southeast could adversely affect our business 
substantially all of our stores are located in the southeast region of the united states 
although the southeast is generally known for its mild weather  the region is susceptible to severe storms including hurricanes  thunderstorms  extended periods of rain  ice storms and heavy snow  all of which we experienced in fiscal inclement weather conditions as well as severe storms in the southeast could damage our facilities or could have a significant impact on consumer behavior  travel and convenience store traffic patterns as well as our ability to operate our locations 
in addition  we typically generate higher revenues and gross margins during warmer weather months in the southeast  which fall within our third and fourth quarters 
if weather conditions are not favorable during these periods  our operating results and cash flow from operations could be adversely affected 
we would also be impacted by regional occurrences in the southeast such as energy shortages or increases in energy prices  fires or other natural disasters 
inability to identify  acquire and integrate new stores could adversely affect our ability to grow our business 
an important part of our historical growth strategy has been to acquire other convenience stores that complement our existing stores or broaden our geographic presence  such as our acquisition of convenience stores operating under the golden gallon banner on october  from april through october  we acquired  convenience stores in major and numerous smaller transactions 
we expect to continue to selectively acquire convenience stores as an element of our growth strategy 
acquisitions involve risks that could cause our actual growth or operating results to differ adversely compared to our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts 
for example we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or acquire additional convenience stores on favorable terms 
we compete with others to acquire convenience stores 
we believe that this competition may increase and could result in decreased availability or increased prices for suitable acquisition candidates 
it may be difficult to anticipate the timing and availability of acquisition candidates 
during the acquisition process we may fail or be unable to discover some of the liabilities of companies or businesses which we acquire 
these liabilities may result from a prior owner s noncompliance with applicable federal  state or local laws 
we may not be able to obtain the necessary financing  on favorable terms or at all  to finance any of our potential acquisitions 
we may fail to successfully integrate or manage acquired convenience stores 
acquired convenience stores may not perform as we expect or we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and financial improvements we anticipate 
we face the risk that our existing systems  financial controls  information systems  management resources and human resources will need to grow to support significant growth 
our financial leverage and debt covenants impact our fiscal and financial flexibility 
we are highly leveraged  which means that the amount of our outstanding debt is large compared to the net book value of our assets  and we have substantial repayment obligations under our outstanding debt 
we have to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service  rather than for investing in our operations or to implement our growth strategy 
as of september   we had consolidated debt including capital lease obligations of approximately million and shareholders equity of approximately million 
as of september   on a pro forma basis giving effect to the golden gallon acquisition  our availability under our senior credit facility for borrowing or issuing additional letters of credit was approximately million 
we are vulnerable to increases in interest rates because the debt under our senior credit facility is at a variable interest rate 
although in the past we have on occasion entered into certain hedging instruments in an effort to manage our interest rate risk  we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so  on favorable terms or at all  in the future 
our senior credit facility and indenture contain numerous financial and operating covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities such as acquiring or disposing of assets  engaging in mergers or reorganizations  making investments or capital expenditures and paying dividends 
these covenants require that we meet interest coverage  minimum ebitda and leverage tests 
the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes and our senior credit facility permit us and our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt  subject to limitations 
any breach of these covenants could cause a default under our debt obligations and result in our debt becoming immediately due and payable  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for the twelve month period ending september   we failed to satisfy two financial covenants required by our senior credit facility 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we received a waiver from our senior credit group and executed an amendment to the senior credit facility that included  among other things  a modification to the financial covenants and certain increases in the floating interest rate 
our ability to respond to changing business conditions and to secure additional financing may be restricted by these covenants  which may become more restrictive in the future 
we also may be prevented from engaging in transactions  including acquisitions that may be important to our long term growth strategy  as a result of covenant restrictions or borrowing capabilities under our credit facilities 
we are subject to state and federal environmental and other regulations 
our business is subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations including  but not limited to  environmental regulations  employment laws and regulations  regulations governing the sale of alcohol and tobacco  minimum wage requirements  working condition requirements  citizenship requirements and other laws and regulations 
a violation or change of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  we may  as the owner or operator of our locations  be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination at these or our former locations  whether or not we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of such contamination 
the failure to properly remediate such contamination may subject us to liability to third parties and may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow money using such property as collateral 
additionally  persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at sites where they are located  whether or not such site is owned or operated by such person 
although we do not typically arrange for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances  we may be deemed to have arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and  therefore  may be liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as other related costs  including governmental fines  and injuries to persons  property and natural resources 
compliance with existing and future environmental laws regulating underground storage tanks may require significant capital expenditures and the remediation costs and other costs required to clean up or treat contaminated sites could be substantial 
we pay tank fees and other taxes to state trust funds in support of future remediation obligations 
these state trust funds or other responsible third parties including insurers are expected to pay or reimburse us for remediation expenses less a deductible 
to the extent third parties do not pay for remediation as we anticipate  we will be obligated to make these payments  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
reimbursements from state trust funds will be dependent on the continued viability of these funds 
in the future  we may incur substantial expenditures for remediation of contamination that has not been discovered at existing locations or locations that we may acquire 
we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at all of our current and former locations  that material environmental conditions not known to us do not exist  that future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose material environmental liability on us  or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our locations 
in addition  failure to comply with any environmental regulations or an increase in regulations could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
state laws regulate the sale of alcohol and tobacco products 
a violation or change of these laws could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations because state and local regulatory agencies have the power to approve  revoke  suspend or deny applications for  and renewals of  permits and licenses relating to the sale of these products or to seek other remedies 
any appreciable increase in the statutory minimum wage rate or income or overtime pay or adoption of mandated health benefits would result in an increase in our labor costs and such cost increase  or the penalties for failing to comply with such statutory minimums  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  regulations are proposed which  if adopted  could also have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we depend on one principal supplier for the majority of our merchandise 
we purchase over of our general merchandise  including most tobacco products and grocery items  from a single wholesale grocer  mclane company  inc  or mclane 
we have a contract with mclane until october  but we may not be able to renew the contract upon expiration 
a change of suppliers  a disruption in supply or a significant change in our relationship with our principal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business  cost of goods  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on two principal suppliers for the majority of our gasoline 
during february of  we signed new gasoline supply agreements with bp products  na  or bp  and citgo petroleum corporation  or citgo 
we expect that bp and citgo will supply approximately of our projected gasoline purchases after an approximately month conversion process 
we have contracts with each of bp and citgo until  but we may not be able to renew either contract upon expiration 
a change of suppliers  a disruption in supply or a significant change in our relationship with our principal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business  cost of goods  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not achieve the full expected cost savings and other benefits of our acquisition of golden gallon we expect to achieve million of annualized cost savings and benefits within the to months following the acquisition of golden gallon 
these cost savings and benefits include  among others  savings associated with the elimination of duplicate overhead and infrastructure  benefits received by golden gallon under our merchandise and gas supply agreements and the expansion of quick service restaurants in selected stores 
while we believe our estimates of these cost savings and benefits to be reasonable  they are estimates which are difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to replicate the results that we achieved at our stores at the golden gallon stores 
in addition  we cannot assure you that unforeseen factors will not offset the estimated cost savings and other benefits from the acquisition 
as a result  our actual cost savings and other anticipated benefits could differ or be delayed  compared to our estimates and from the other information contained in this prospectus 
because we depend on our senior management s experience and knowledge of our industry  we would be adversely affected if senior management left the pantry 
we are dependent on the continued efforts of our senior management team  including our president and chief executive officer  peter j 
sodini 
mr 
sodini s employment contract terminates in september if  for any reason  our senior executives do not continue to be active in management  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain additional qualified senior personnel as needed in the future 
in addition  we do not maintain key personnel life insurance on our senior executives and other key employees 
we also rely on our ability to recruit store managers  regional managers and other store personnel

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our existing long term debt and any future financing requirements 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of outstanding balances on our senior subordinated notes and our variable rate debt relates to borrowings under our senior credit facility 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding long term debt and have designated each qualifying instrument as a cash flow hedge 
we formally document our hedge relationships  including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction 
at hedge inception  and at least quarterly thereafter  we assess whether derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the hedged item 
we measure effectiveness by the ability of the interest rate swaps to offset cash flows associated with changes in the variable libor rate associated with our term loan facilities using the hypothetical derivative method 
to the extent the instruments are considered to be effective  changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
for those interest rate swap agreements that do not qualify for hedge accounting  changes in fair value are recorded as an adjustment to interest expense 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates 
at september   the interest rate on of our debt was fixed by either the nature of the obligation or through the interest rate swap arrangements compared to at september  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would not be expected to result in a loss in future earnings

we manage interest rate risk on our outstanding long term and short term debt through the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt  management continues to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis
