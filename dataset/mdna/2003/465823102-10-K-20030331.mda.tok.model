net revenues and gross profit net revenues for the year ended december   totaled billion consistent with the billion reported in the net revenues decrease in north american subsidiaries was offset by increases from european subsidiaries  latin american subsidiaries and other operations 
as a result of exchange rate differences  net revenues decreased by million in as compared to north american subsidiaries generated net revenues of million in compared to million in the million  or  decrease in net revenues was primarily attributable to decreased volume and lower prices of our paclitaxel product and higher sales returns and allowances  partially offset by increased volume and prices of certain other brand equivalent pharmaceutical products  increased sales of proprietary respiratory products and the receipt of increased product development fees 
north american subsidiaries recorded provisions for sales returns and allowances that reduced gross sales by million in and million in the increase of million  or  was primarily due to price changes on certain brand equivalent pharmaceutical products and changes in sales volume and product mix 
european subsidiaries generated net revenues of million in compared to million in the million  or  increase in net revenues was primarily due to higher sales volumes and favorable effects of currency exchange rates and million of other revenues from a previously deferred up front payment received under a license agreement that was terminated during the third quarter of  partially offset by reduced product development fees and lower prices for certain brand equivalent products 
european subsidiaries recorded provisions for sales returns and allowances that reduced gross sales by million in and million in the increase of million  or  was primarily due to reduced prices on certain brand equivalent pharmaceutical products and increased financial discounts 
latin american subsidiaries generated net revenues of million in compared to million in the million  or  increase was primarily due to revenue generated by laboratorio chile sa lab chile  which was acquired july   partially offset by unfavorable effects of currency exchange rates 
latin american subsidiaries recorded provisions for sales returns and allowances that reduced gross sales by million in and million in the increase of million  or  was primarily due to the inclusion of the operations of lab chile for the full year in as compared to only a partial period in gross profit for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million of net revenues from million of net revenues in the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to reduced volume and pricing of our paclitaxel product 
we are continuing to experience increased competition for paclitaxel as well as our brand equivalent albuterol products and the resulting pricing and volume pressures have negatively impacted  and may continue to negatively impact  our revenues and gross profits 
our results for were also adversely impacted by significant currency devaluations in argentina and venezuela  reductions in government purchases of our products in mexico and continued pricing pressures in the united states and the united kingdom 
revenues from the sale of our paclitaxel product did not contribute significantly to our revenues and gross profits during and  because of the continuing price erosion and competition  are not likely to contribute significantly in the near future to our north american results 
as part of our ongoing business strategy  we enter into collaborative alliances  which allow us to exploit our drug discovery and development capabilities or provide us with intellectual property and technologies 
many of these alliances involve licenses to other companies relating to technologies or compounds under development and  in some cases  finished products 
these licenses permit us to reduce our development costs and often involve the receipt of an up front payment and fees upon completion of certain development milestones and also provide for royalties based on sales of the products 
we have received significant payments in the past from these arrangements  including  but not limited to  payments under the product collaboration and development services agreement with bristol myers squibb bms  which expired in november in october  we entered into a new agreement with bms that supersedes  effective november  the prior product collaboration agreement 
the new agreement  which in part relates to some of the subject matter of the earlier agreement  also encompasses additional arrangements between the parties and has a term of ten months  although the parties may enter into additional collaboration agreements if certain option rights contained therein are exercised 
we expect that milestone  developmental  royalty and other payments under existing and new collaboration and license agreements with other parties  including expected payments under the new agreement with bms  the development agreement with serono sa for our cladribine product for the treatment of multiple sclerosis  and the recently announced license agreement with novartis pharma ag to utilize our airmax tm multi dose dry powder inhalers for novartis trademarked medicines foradil r formoterol and miflonide r budesonide in the european union and certain other countries  as well as other agreements which we expect to enter into  will continue to be an important part of our business 
our future net revenues and profits will depend and will fluctuate from period to period  in part  based upon our ability to replace or renew license fees  royalties and development service fees as the related agreements expire or are terminated 
we expect that our future net revenues and profits will also depend upon o our ability to obtain and maintain fda approval of our manufacturing facilities  o our ability to maintain a pipeline of products in development  o our ability to achieve the milestones specified in our license and development agreements  o our ability to manufacture  obtain and maintain a sufficient supply of products to meet market demand  retain our customers and meet contractual deadlines and terms  o our ability to develop and rapidly introduce new products  o the timing of regulatory approval of such products  o our ability to manufacture such products efficiently  o the number and timing of regulatory approvals of competing products  o our ability to forecast inventory levels and trends at our customers and their end customers  and o our and our competitors pricing and chargeback policies

we are a defendant in a number of product liability cases  none of which we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we believe that we maintain an adequate amount of product liability insurance  but there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover all existing and future claims or that we will be able to maintain existing coverage or obtain additional coverage at reasonable rates 
there can be no assurance that claims arising under any pending or future product liability cases  whether or not covered by insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ivax corporation and all majority owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below using different yet still reasonable estimates and judgments 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
management periodically evaluates estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements and makes changes on a prospective basis when adjustments are necessary 
significant estimates include amounts for accounts receivable exposures  deferred tax asset allowances  inventory reserves  environmental reserves  litigation and sales returns and allowances  including chargebacks  rebates  returns and shelf stock adjustments  and the useful lives of intangible assets 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances revenues and the related cost of sales are recognized at the time title to our products passes to our customers 
our pharmaceutical revenues are affected by the level of provisions for estimated returns  inventory credits  discounts  promotional allowances  volume rebates  chargebacks  reimbursements relating to medicaid and medicare and other allowances 
the custom in the us pharmaceutical industry is generally to grant customers the right to return purchased goods 
in the brand equivalent pharmaceutical industry  this custom has resulted in a practice of suppliers issuing inventory credits also known as shelf stock adjustments to customers based on the customers existing inventory following decreases in the market price of the related brand equivalent pharmaceutical product 
we have contractual agreements with many of our customers  which require that we grant these customers inventory credit following a price decrease 
in other cases  the determination to grant a credit to a customer following a price decrease is at our discretion 
these credits allow customers with established inventories to compete with those buying product at the current market price  and allow us to maintain shelf space  market share and customer loyalty 
provisions for estimated returns  inventory credits and chargebacks  as well as other sales allowances  are established by us concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
the provisions are established in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including actual return and inventory credit experience for products during the past several years by product type  the number and timing of regulatory approvals for the product by our competitors both historical and projected  the market for the product  expected sell through levels by our wholesaler customers to customers with contractual pricing arrangements with us  estimated customer inventory levels by product and projected economic conditions 
actual product returns and inventory credits incurred are  however  dependent upon future events  including remaining shelf life and price competition and the level of customer inventories at the time of any price decreases 
we continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and customer inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe that actual product returns  inventory credits and other allowances may differ from established reserves 
royalty and license fee income are recognized when obligations associated with earning the royalty or licensing fee have been satisfied and are included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with sab no 
 our accounting policy is to review each contract and  if appropriate  we defer up front payments  whether or not they are refundable  and recognize them in income over the obligation period 
where we expend resources to achieve milestones  we recognize the milestone payments in income currently 
the total amortization of up front payments and current recognition of milestones is limited to nonrefundable provisions of the contract 
gain on sale of product rights royalty and milestone payments from the sale of rights to elmiron r and certain other urology products in the united states and canada to alza corporation amounted to million in  million in and million in  and are included in other income as additional gain on the sale of product rights 
during the fourth quarter of  we received million in connection with certain amendments to the contract for the sale of elmiron r with omp 
as this payment was nonrefundable and we have no further obligations under the agreement  this payment was recorded as additional consideration for the sale 
we will continue to receive payments from omp over the next several years based upon sales of elmiron r by omp  with specified minimum royalty payments due for the period of through a portion of the up front and milestone payments received and included in other income in prior years  million as of december   is refundable through december   and then ratably decreases through  if the patent rights are found to be invalid and a brand equivalent of elmiron r is introduced by another company 
we believe the probability of occurrence of these events is remote 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may require revision or that the remaining net book value may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that an asset may be impaired  we use various methods to estimate the asset s future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the asset 
any impairment amount is charged to operations 
sale of subsidiary stock during  we elected income statement recognition as our accounting policy for sales of subsidiary stock and recorded a gain of million  related to the merger of ivax diagnostics  with bbstores 
com  which is included in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
legal costs legal charges are recorded for the costs anticipated to be incurred in connection with litigation and claims against us when we can reasonably estimate these costs 
we intend to vigorously defend each of the lawsuits described in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  but their respective outcomes cannot be predicted 
any of such lawsuits or investigations  if determined adversely to us  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our ultimate liability with respect to any of these proceedings is not presently determinable 
we are involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  some of which involve substantial amounts 
in order to obtain brand equivalent approvals prior to the expiration of patents on branded products  and to benefit from the exclusivity allowed to abbreviated new drug application applicants that successfully challenge these patents  we frequently become involved in patent infringement litigation brought by branded pharmaceutical companies 
although these lawsuits involve products that are not yet marketed and therefore pose little or no risk of liability for damages  the legal fees and costs incurred in defending such litigation can be substantial 
while it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome or the total cost of these proceedings  in our opinion  based on a review with legal counsel  any losses resulting from such legal proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we  in the normal course of doing business  are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have subsidiaries in more than countries worldwide 
during  sales outside the united states accounted for approximately of worldwide sales 
virtually all of these sales were denominated in currencies of the local country 
as such  our reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates 
if the united states dollar weakens relative to the foreign currency  the earnings generated in the foreign currency will  in effect  increase when converted into united states dollars and vice versa 
although we do not speculate in the foreign exchange market  we do from time to time manage exposures that arise in the normal course of business related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into offsetting positions through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts 
as a result of exchange rate differences  net revenues decreased by million in  as compared to and decreased by million in compared to the effects of inflation on consolidated net revenues and operating income were not significant 
certain firmly committed transactions are hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts 
as exchange rates change  gains and losses on the exposed transactions are partially offset by gains and losses related to the hedging contracts 
both the exposed transactions and the hedging contracts are translated at current spot rates  with gains and losses included in earnings 
our derivative activities  which primarily consist of foreign exchange forward contracts  are initiated primarily to hedge forecasted cash flows that are exposed to foreign currency risk 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally require us to exchange local currencies for foreign currencies based on pre established exchange rates at the contracts maturity dates 
if the counterparties to the exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contracted currencies  we could be at risk for currency related fluctuations 
we enter into these contracts with counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy and do not enter into any leveraged derivative transactions 
as of december   we had million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  primarily to hedge euro based operating cash flows against pounds sterling 
as of december   we had million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  of which million related to united states dollar denominated bank loans of million of our argentine based subsidiary  ivax argentina 
the million of bank loans were repaid in january resulting in a pretax loss of million 
as of december   we had million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding 
interest rate risk our only material debt obligations relate to the and convertible notes  which bear fixed rates of interest  and the amounts we owe for the purchase of qvar r  which carry no stated interest rate 
we believe that our exposure to market risk relating to interest rate risk is not material
