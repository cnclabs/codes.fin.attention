critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities if any 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product discounts and returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  product liabilities  restructuring  closed mine obligations  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  actuarial valuations and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
product liabilities the company provides for the estimated cost of personal and property damage relating to the company s products 
reserves are made for estimates of the costs for known claims and estimates of the costs of incidents that have occurred but for which a claim has not yet been reported to the company  in excess of available insurance coverage 
while the company engages in extensive product quality reviews and customer education programs  the company s product liability provision is affected by the number and magnitude of claims of alleged product related damage and the cost to defend those claims 
in addition  the provision for product liabilities is also affected by changes in assumptions for medical costs  inflation rates  trends in damages awarded by juries and estimates of the number of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
changes to the estimate of any of these factors could result in a material change to the company s product liability provision causing a related increase or decrease in reported net operating results in the period of change in the estimate 
closed mine obligations the company s wholly owned subsidiary  bellaire corporation bellaire  is a non operating subsidiary with legacy liabilities relating to closed mining operations  primarily former eastern us underground mining operations 
these legacy liabilities include obligations for black lung and other retiree medical benefits  environmental clean up and obligations to the united mine workers of america combined benefit fund arising as a result of the coal industry retiree health benefit act of provisions made by bellaire for these liabilities include estimates of the number of beneficiaries assigned to bellaire  medical cost trend rates  inflation rates  actuarially determined mortality tables  cost of ongoing environmental clean up  discount factors and legal costs to defend claims 
in addition  these liabilities can be influenced by judicial proceedings  legislative actions and changes in regulations made by government agencies 
the company continually monitors the regulatory climate which could influence these liabilities as well as the assumptions used to develop accruals for these liabilities 
changes in any of these factors could materially change the company s estimates for these closed mine obligations causing a related increase or decrease in reported net operating results in the period of change in the estimate 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of closed mine obligations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc 
and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share  unit  store and percentage data goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
changes in management s judgments and estimates could significantly affect the company s analysis of the impairment of goodwill 
to test goodwill for impairment  the company is required to estimate the fair value of each of its reporting units 
since quoted market prices in an active market are not available for the company s reporting units  the company uses other valuation techniques 
the company has developed a model to estimate the fair value of the reporting units  primarily incorporating a discounted cash flow valuation technique 
this model incorporates the company s estimates of future cash flows  allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units  future growth rates and management s judgment regarding the applicable discount rates to use to discount those estimated cash flows 
changes to these judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
revenue recognition revenues are generally recognized when title transfers or risk of loss passes as customer orders are completed and shipped 
under its mining contracts  the company recognizes revenue as the coal is delivered 
reserves for discounts  returns and product warranties are maintained for anticipated future claims 
the accounting policies used to develop these product discounts  returns and warranties include product discounts the company records estimated reductions to revenues for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price competition  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline or if competition was to increase  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
product returns products generally are not sold with the right of return 
however  based on the company s historical experience  a portion of products sold are estimated to be returned due to reasons such as buyer remorse  duplicate gifts received  product failure and excess inventory stocked by the customer which  subject to certain terms and conditions  the company will agree to accept 
the company records estimated reductions to revenues at the time of sale based on this historical experience and the limited right of return provided to certain customers 
if future trends were to change significantly from those experienced in the past  incremental reductions to revenues may result based on this new experience 
product warranties the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenues are recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  labor costs and replacement component costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  labor costs or replacement component costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which would affect net income 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory reserves the company writes down its inventory to the lower of cost or market  which includes an estimate for obsolescence or excess inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
upon a subsequent sale or disposal of the impaired inventory  the corresponding reserve for impaired value is relieved to ensure that the cost basis of the inventory reflects any write downs 
deferred tax valuation allowances the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount including the valuation allowance  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
conversely  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be expensed in the period such determination was made

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc 
and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share  unit  store and percentage data the north american coal corporation nacoal mines and markets lignite primarily as fuel for power providers 
the lignite is surface mined in north dakota  texas  louisiana and mississippi 
total coal reserves approximate billion tons  with billion tons committed to customers pursuant to long term contracts 
nacoal operates six wholly owned lignite mines the coteau properties company coteau  the falkirk mining company falkirk  the sabine mining company sabine  san miguel lignite mine san miguel  red river mining company red river and mississippi lignite mining company mlmc 
nacoal also provides dragline mining services florida dragline operations for a limerock quarry near miami  florida 
the operating results of coteau  falkirk and sabine are included in project mining subsidiaries 
the operating results of all other operations are included in other mining operations 
financial review nacoal s subsidiaries  coteau  falkirk and sabine  are termed project mining subsidiaries because they mine lignite for utility customers pursuant to long term contracts at a price based on actual cost plus an agreed pre tax profit per ton 
due to the cost plus nature of these contracts  revenues and operating profits are affected by increases and decreases in operating costs  as well as by tons sold 
net income of these project mines  however  is not significantly affected by changes in such operating costs  which include costs of operations  interest expense and certain other items 
because of the nature of the contracts at these three mines  operating results for nacoal are best analyzed in terms of lignite tons sold  income before taxes and net income 
mlmc was notified by its customer that the customer s power plant had reached the commercial operations date cod  as defined in the lignite sales agreement  during the first quarter of because of a delay in the cod  mlmc received liquidated damages payments  as provided in the lignite sales agreement  beginning on january  and continuing into the first quarter of in addition  mlmc received a final liquidated damages settlement of million in the fourth quarter of mlmc does not anticipate receiving additional liquidated damages payments or related settlements from its customer relating to the delay in cod 
although mlmc had delivered nominal quantities of lignite in and during the first quarter of  in the second quarter of mlmc began delivery of lignite to its customer in quantities that  on an annual basis  approximate the anticipated annual full production level of million tons 
lignite tons sold by nacoal s operating lignite mines were as follows for the year ended december coteau falkirk sabine san miguel mlmc 
red river 


total lignite the florida dragline operations mined million  million and million cubic yards of limerock for the years ended december   and  respectively 
total coal reserves declined to billion at december  and billion at december  from billion at december  primarily due to the expiration of non renewable coal leases in undeveloped areas and due to tons mined

income before taxes for the other mining operations includes the effect of liquidated damages and related settlements at mlmc and the san miguel arbitration award 
compared with revenues for increased to million  an increase of from million in increased revenues in as compared with are primarily due to an increase in tons sold at mlmc due to the commencement of commercial operations of the customer s power plant in and increased tons sold at sabine  partially offset by i a million decrease in liquidated damages payments and related settlements received by mlmc  ii a decrease in pass through costs billed to the project mining subsidiaries customers and iii a decrease in tons sold at red river 
as provided in the lignite sales agreement with its customer  mlmc received liquidated damages payments and related settlements during and due to a delay in the cod of its customer s power plant 
mlmc was notified by its customer that the customer s power plant had reached the cod during the first quarter of as such  mlmc does not anticipate further liquidated damages payments or related settlements in or beyond 
income before taxes decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to i increased operating costs at mlmc primarily due to the significant increase in production and delivery of lignite to the customer during as compared with lower operating costs recognized when receiving liquidated damages payments during  ii lower tons sold at red river and iii a million charge for the write off of an investment in undeveloped reserves that are no longer expected to be developed 
these decreases were partially offset by a million gain on the sale of undeveloped eastern coal reserves in that were not aligned with nacoal s development strategies 
net income in decreased to million from million in as a result of the factors affecting income before taxes  partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for as compared with is primarily due to an adjustment of million in for the favorable resolution of certain tax issues that were provided for in prior years and for other tax matters and due to a greater proportion of income from operations in eligible to record a benefit from percentage depletion 
compared with revenues for increased to million  up from million in revenues increased in as compared with primarily due to i million of contractual liquidated damages payments recorded by mlmc due to a delay of the commercial operation of the customer s power plant  ii increased revenues from project mines  iii initial lignite sales at mlmc and iv a slight increase in tons sold at red river 
net tonnage volume decreased at the project mining subsidiaries due to a customer s plant outage at falkirk and reduced customer requirements at coteau and sabine 
although tonnage volume decreased  revenues from the project mining subsidiaries increased primarily as a result of an increase in pass through costs at sabine 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc 
and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share  unit  store and percentage data income before taxes increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to i the contractual liquidated damages payments recorded by mlmc  ii initial lignite sales at mlmc and iii increased tonnage volume at red river 
these increases were partially offset by higher interest expense 
net income in increased to million from million in as a result of these factors  partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate as compared with the effective tax rate increase in as compared with was primarily due to a greater proportion of income from operations that  at the time  were not eligible to record a permanent tax benefit from percentage depletion 
the effective tax rate in reflects an income tax benefit on pre tax income primarily due to both the increased effect of percentage depletion and a nonrecurring adjustment for the resolution of certain tax issues provided for in prior years 
liquidity and capital resources nacoal s non project mine financing needs are provided by a revolving line of credit of up to million and a term loan with a principal balance of million at december  the nacoal facility 
the nacoal facility requires annual term loan principal repayments of million  with a final term loan principal repayment of million in october the revolving credit facility of million is available until the facility s expiration in october the nacoal facility has performance based pricing  which sets interest rates based upon achieving various levels of debt to ebitda ratios  as defined 
the nacoal facility establishes financial targets which must be satisfied before nacoal can make certain payments and dividends to nacco or make significant investments 
see further discussion of the terms of the nacoal facility in note to the consolidated financial statements 
nacoal had million of its million revolving credit facility available at december  following is a table which summarizes the contractual obligations of nacoal  excluding the obligations of the project mining subsidiaries 
the financing of the project mining subsidiaries  which is either provided or guaranteed by the utility customers  includes long term equipment leases  notes payable and advances from customers 
the obligations of the project mining subsidiaries do not affect the short term or long term liquidity of nacoal and are without recourse to nacco or nacoal 
as such  these contractual obligations  which are discussed in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  have been excluded from the table below 
payments due by period nacoal  excluding project mines  contractual obligations total thereafter nacoal facility off balance sheet operating leases total contractual cash obligations an event of default  as defined in the nacoal facility agreement and in nacoal s operating lease agreements  could cause an acceleration of the payment schedule 
no such event of default has occurred or is anticipated to occur 
nacoal believes that funds available under its revolving credit agreement  operating cash flows and financing provided by the project mining subsidiaries customers are sufficient to finance all of its term loan principal repayments and its operating needs and commitments arising during the foreseeable future 
following is a table which summarizes actual and planned capital expenditures planned actual actual capital expenditures nacoal  excluding project mining subsidiaries project mining subsidiaries total nacoal capital expenditures for nacoal  excluding the project mining subsidiaries  decreased in as compared with primarily due to reduced mine development activities at mlmc in capital expenditures at the project mining subsidiaries  which are funded by the project mining subsidiaries customers  increased in as compared with primarily due to the acquisition of new mining equipment

as a result  the december  net asset value of million and the present value of the lease obligation of million at december  are not included on the balance sheet at december  the decrease in the other net tangible assets is also due to a million increase in the deferred tax liability primarily due to mine development and project costs that are eligible to be deducted for taxes at an accelerated rate as compared with the depreciation rate used for book purposes 
the decline in total debt in as compared with also resulted from improved cash flows from the operations at mlmc

while revenues declined in  bookings have increased steadily from the low levels in mid  reflecting an increase from the severe decline in the lift truck segment of the broader capital goods market in north america in despite the volume decline  operating profit increased to million in from million in results in include a restructuring charge of million  which is discussed in further detail below 
results in included million of expenses incurred during related to the danville plant closure announced in and a restructuring charge of million recognized in for cost reductions in europe 
in addition  includes goodwill amortization expense of million  which is no longer required beginning in as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of the statement is discussed further in note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding these non comparable items  the increase in operating profit was primarily driven by a shift in mix to higher margin lift trucks and the positive impact on the cost of operations from improvement programs initiated in  including the completion of the danville  illinois  plant closure in the fourth quarter of and the benefits of procurement  restructuring and cost control programs 
the impact of these factors was partially offset by reduced unit volume 
net income increased to million in from a net loss of million in as a result of the factors affecting operating profit and due to certain favorable tax adjustments including a million settlement from a transfer pricing tax audit and a million tax benefit related to the recognition of previously generated losses in china 
the positive effect of these factors was partially offset by i increased interest expense  including the amortization of deferred financing fees  ii the negative effect of interest rate swap agreements and iii a charge for the impairment of certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
the increase in interest expense  the negative effect of interest rate swap agreements and the amortization of deferred financing fees relate to the refinancing of nmhg s debt during the second quarter of  which is discussed further in liquidity and capital resources 
also affecting the year over year comparability of net income is a pre tax insurance recovery of million million after tax included in other income in relating to flood damage in september at s n and a million after tax charge in for the cumulative effect of accounting changes for derivatives and pension costs 
the worldwide backlog level increased to  units at december  from  units at december  and from  units at september  primarily due to increased demand for lift trucks in the americas 
restructuring plan in  management committed to the restructuring of certain operations in americas and europe 
as such  nmhg wholesale recognized a restructuring charge of million pre tax million after tax  of which million relates to a non cash asset impairment charge and million relates to severance and other employee benefits to be paid to approximately manufacturing and administrative employees 
severance payments are expected to begin in and continue through as announced in december  nmhg wholesale will phase out its lenoir  north carolina  lift truck component facility and restructure other manufacturing and administrative operations  primarily its irvine  scotland  lift truck assembly and component facility 
these actions are designed to essentially complete the restructuring of nmhg wholesale s global manufacturing facility structure 
previously announced programs such as demand flow technology tm  selected component outsourcing and innovative lift truck designs have enabled nmhg to maintain substantially unchanged lift truck production capacity in fewer facilities and at a reduced cost 
the lenoir component facility is expected to be phased out over a to month period  beginning december  the lenoir plant s lift truck component operations  including mast and cylinder manufacturing  will be consolidated into plants in sulligent  alabama  berea  kentucky  and greenville  north carolina 
the irvine assembly and component facility is expected to be restructured to an appropriately sized operation 
the restructured facility is expected to manufacture three and four wheel electric rider lift trucks and mast components for the european market 
other lift truck components currently manufactured in irvine will be outsourced to independent suppliers

however  total costs of this restructuring program incurred in and beyond are expected to be substantially mitigated by government incentives 
initial net benefits from this restructuring program are expected to be realized in with a full twelve months of estimated annual pre tax benefits of approximately million expected beginning in although a majority of the projected savings is the result of a reduction in fixed factory costs  the overall benefit estimates could vary depending on unit volumes and the resulting impact on manufacturing efficiencies 
in addition  outlays for capital expenditures  primarily for new tooling and equipment  of approximately million are expected in compared with revenues decreased to  million in from  million in a steep drop in the lift truck segment of the broader capital goods market in north america resulted in an reduction in worldwide lift truck shipments at nmhg wholesale 
a total of  units were shipped in compared with  units shipped in the rate of monthly retail orders in the us and canada declined approximately from the peak month in as compared with the lowest month in nmhg wholesale s revenues also declined due to lower parts sales resulting from reduced lift truck utilization which is typical during a capital goods recession 
the decrease in revenues  which was primarily driven by unit volume  was partially offset by a shift in mix to higher priced lift trucks 
operating profit decreased to million for from million for the decrease in operating profit was largely due to reduced unit and parts volume and resulting reductions in the absorption of manufacturing overhead costs and related manufacturing inefficiencies 
additionally  operating profit was adversely affected by million of expenses incurred during related to the danville plant closure announced in and a restructuring charge of million recognized in for cost reductions in europe 
these charges compare with a restructuring charge of million recognized in for the danville plant closure 
see below for a further discussion of these restructuring charges 
the decrease in operating profit is also attributable to write downs of inventory taken in primarily due to an increase in the estimate of obsolete and excess inventory on hand 
the decline in operating profit was offset somewhat by favorable foreign currency effects  lower incentive compensation costs and an increase in the average sales price per unit 
nmhg wholesale recorded a net loss for of million as compared with net income of million for the decline in net operating results was due to the factors affecting operating profit  the effect of nondeductible goodwill amortization and an increase in the valuation allowance on the tax provision and due to a million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of accounting changes in see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these accounting changes

as such  nmhg wholesale recognized a restructuring charge of approximately million pre tax for severance and other employee benefits to be paid to approximately manufacturing and administrative personnel in europe 
as of december   approximately million has been paid to approximately employees and million of the amount accrued at december  was reversed in leaving an ending accrual balance of million at december  additional pre tax costs of million were recognized in for the nmhg wholesale european restructuring plan for costs not eligible to be accrued as of december  as a result of the reduced headcount in europe  nmhg wholesale realized pre tax cost savings primarily from reduced employee wages and benefits of million in and estimates annual pre tax cost saving of million beginning in however  additional costs of approximately million are expected to be recognized in relating to this program 
although a majority of the projected savings is the result of a reduction in fixed factory costs  the overall benefit estimates could vary depending on unit volumes and the resulting impact on manufacturing efficiencies 
in  the board of directors approved management s plan to transfer manufacturing activities from nmhg s danville  illinois  assembly plant to its other global manufacturing plants 
the adoption of this plan resulted in million of costs accrued in  relating to retirement costs  medical costs and employee severance benefits 
in addition  an impairment charge of million was recognized in as a result of the anticipated disposition of certain assets at an amount below net book value 
during  payments for severance and other benefits of million were made to approximately employees 
in addition  the accrual for severance was reduced by million 
approximately million of pre tax costs associated with the danville phase out  which were not eligible for accrual as of december   were expensed during item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc

also in  nmhg wholesale recognized a charge of approximately million  which had not previously been accrued  related primarily to the costs of the idle danville facility 
cost savings primarily from reduced employee wages and benefits of approximately million pre tax were realized in related to this program 
cost savings primarily from reduced employee wages and benefits are estimated to be million pre tax  net of idle facility costs  in and million pre tax annually thereafter  as a result of anticipated improved manufacturing efficiencies and reduced fixed factory overhead 
although a significant portion of the projected savings is the result of a reduction in fixed factory costs  the overall benefit estimates could vary depending on unit volumes and the resulting impact on manufacturing efficiencies

nmhg retail net of eliminations compared with revenues decreased to million in from million in revenues declined primarily due to the sale of certain european retail dealerships in the fourth quarter of the sold operations  which generated revenues of million  net of intercompany eliminations  in the decline in revenues is also attributable to reduced market demand in the americas and in europe  especially in the territories in which nmhg s owned retail dealerships operate

adjustments to reserves booked against these assets  including inventory reserves  will change the eligible borrowing base and thereby impact the liquidity provided by the facility 
the borrowers include nmhg holding co 
and certain domestic and foreign subsidiaries of nmhg holding co 
borrowings bear interest at a floating rate  which can be either a base rate or libor  as defined  plus an applicable margin 
the current applicable margins  effective december   for base rate loans and libor loans were and  respectively

these contingent liabilities may take the form of guarantees of residual values or standby recourse or repurchase obligations 
for these transactions  nmhg generally retains a perfected security interest in the lift truck  such that nmhg would take possession of the lift truck in the event that nmhg would become liable under the terms of the guarantees or standby recourse or repurchase obligations 
generally  these commitments are due upon demand in the event of default by the customer 
the security interest is by and large expected to equal or exceed the amount of the commitment 
to the extent that nmhg would be required to provide funding as a result of these commitments  nmhg believes that the value of its perfected security interest and amounts available under existing credit facilities are adequate to meet these commitments in the foreseeable future 
the amount of the standby recourse or repurchase obligations increase and decrease over time as obligations under existing arrangements expire and new obligations arise in the ordinary course of business 
losses anticipated under the terms of the guarantees or standby recourse or repurchase obligations are not significant and have been reserved for in the consolidated financial statements

this obligation was initially recognized by bellaire as an extraordinary charge in to accrue for the estimated costs associated with the coal act 
see additional discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease to the company s estimate of the umwa obligation in was made  in part  because of a us district court s ruling that was upheld by the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit in which invalidated the social security administration s ssa assignment of certain retired coal miners to bellaire 
this ruling reduced the company s estimate of the total beneficiaries assigned to bellaire as part of the coal act

on january   the us supreme court decided that the initial assignments made after october  are valid despite their untimeliness 
as a result  the company increased its estimate of the number of beneficiaries assigned to bellaire 
however  the effect of the assignment of additional beneficiaries from this decision is offset somewhat by a favorable decision from the us supreme court in that the ssa s assignment of certain retired coal miners to companies defined as successors in interest to a signatory operator no longer in business was not permitted under the coal act 
this decision resulted in a reduction to the estimate of the number of beneficiaries assigned to bellaire

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk on may   nmhg refinanced a majority of its floating rate debt financing with the issuance of senior notes at a fixed rate of interest 
as a result of this refinancing during  nmhg terminated all of its interest rate swap agreements 
the combined notional amount and fair market value of the interest rate swap agreements terminated was million and a payable of million  respectively  on the respective dates of termination 
a small portion of nmhg s financing  however  requires interest payments based on floating interest rates 
also in  hb ps terminated certain interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of million and a net payable balance of million on the date of termination 
see additional discussion of these transactions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the fixed rate debt financing at nmhg  the company s subsidiaries  nacoal  nmhg  hb ps and kci  have entered into certain financing arrangements that require interest payments based on floating interest rates 
as such  the company s financial results are subject to changes in the market rate of interest 
to reduce the exposure to changes in the market rate of interest  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements for a significant portion of its floating rate financing arrangements 
the company does not enter into interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes 
terms of the interest rate swap agreements require the subsidiaries to receive a variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate 
see also note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  the company uses sensitivity analysis to measure the potential loss in fair value of financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company assumes that a loss in fair value is an increase to its liabilities 
the fair market value  based on a market quote  of the company s fixed rate debt  which was issued in  was million at december  assuming a hypothetical decrease in the effective interest yield on this fixed rate debt  the fair market value of this liability would increase by million as compared with the fair market value of this liability at december  the fair market value of the company s interest rate swap agreements  excluding interest rate swap agreements held by the project mining subsidiaries  was a liability of million at december  and million at december  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december  and  would cause an increase in the fair market value of interest rate swap agreements liability amount by and million  respectively  as compared with their fair market value  which is a liability  at december  and  respectively 
changes in the fair market value of the project mining subsidiaries interest rate swap agreements do not affect the company s results of operations or financial condition because the cost of interest  which includes the effect of interest rate swap agreements  is included in the cost of coal passed through to the customer 
foreign currency exchange rate risk nmhg and hb ps operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
as such  their financial results are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements 
nmhg and hb ps use forward foreign currency exchange contracts to partially reduce risks related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies and not for trading purposes 
these contracts mature within one year and require the companies to buy or sell japanese yen  australian dollars  canadian dollars  mexican pesos  british pounds sterling or euros for the functional currency in which the applicable subsidiary operates at rates agreed to at the inception of the contracts 
the fair market value of these contracts was a net asset of million and a net liability of million at december  and  respectively 
see also note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  the company uses sensitivity analysis to measure the potential loss in fair value of financial instruments sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company assumes that a loss in fair value is either a decrease to its assets or an increase to its liabilities 
assuming a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar as compared with other foreign currencies at december  and  the fair market value of foreign currency sensitive financial instruments  which primarily represents forward foreign currency exchange contracts  would decline by million and million  respectively  as compared with their fair market value at december  and  respectively 
it is important to note that the loss in fair market value indicated in this sensitivity analysis would be somewhat offset by changes in the fair market value of the underlying receivables  payables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
commodity price risk the company uses certain commodities  including steel  resins  linerboard and diesel fuel  in the normal course of its manufacturing and mining processes 
as such  the cost of operations is subject to variability as the market for these commodities change 
the company monitors this risk and  from time to time  enters into derivative contracts to hedge this risk 
the company does not currently have any such derivative contracts outstanding  nor does the company have any significant purchase obligations to obtain fixed quantities of commodities in the future
