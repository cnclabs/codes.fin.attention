critical accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the company s audited december  financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates and for the periods presented 
management believes the following accounting policies  among others  represent its more critical or complex estimates and assumptions used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an on going basis and believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable based on historical experience and other factors 
however  actual results could differ from those estimates and these differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies management has identified as critical or complex accounting policies are described below 
income taxes 
the company s net deferred tax assets consist primarily of the tax benefit related to operating loss carryforwards  alternative minimum tax credits and asset write downs  in connection with store closure reserves  that are not deductible for tax purposes until the assets are disposed 
the company has provided valuation allowances against its deferred net tax assets based on management s most recent assessment that it is not deemed more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
if future assessments by management were to determine that the company would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amounts  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets could result in an increase in net income in the period such determination was made 
long lived assets impairment 
the company reviews its long lived assets related to each restaurant annually for impairment  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable 
the company considers a history of operating losses to be its primary indicator of potential impairment  therefore new restaurants are generally not identified for impairment until a sufficient operating history has been developed 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows  the individual restaurants 
based on the best information available  the company writes down an impaired restaurant to its estimated fair market value  which becomes its new cost basis 
the company generally measures estimated fair value by a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows directly related to the restaurant 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate projected future operating cash flows 
accordingly  if actual results vary from such estimates  significant future impairment could result 
discontinued operations 
considerable management judgment is necessary to determine whether a closed restaurant should be classified as discontinued operations 
in general  the company considers the extent to which the restaurant s operations and cash flow are expected to be absorbed by other currently operated restaurants or replaced with a new restaurant in making this determination 
a closed restaurant  or group of restaurants  which is located in an isolated market and not replaced  would generally be classified as discontinued operations

the fourth quarter normally includes weeks of operations as compared with weeks for each of the three prior quarters 
the fourth quarter of included weeks 
as a result of these factors  net sales and net income in the fourth quarter are not comparable to results in each of the first three fiscal quarters  and net sales can be expected to decline in the first quarter of each fiscal year in comparison to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
because of prior year operating losses  restaurant closures  the seasonality of the company s business and the impact of new restaurant openings  results for any quarter cannot be relied upon as indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year

see business risks included herein 
the company intends to finance its operating cash requirements and fiscal capital requirements through existing cash balances  cash provided by operations  its borrowing arrangements and existing equipment lease financing commitment 
the company has a million commitment for capital equipment lease financing for new furniture  fixtures  equipment and leasehold items of which the company has utilized million through december  the company intends to utilize the remaining commitment to fund restaurant equipment primarily in its new restaurants 
the company may seek additional debt financing to provide greater flexibility if it continues restaurant expansion in and beyond 
the company s ability to continue an expansion strategy will depend upon a variety of factors  including  maintaining a sufficient cash flow from operations and its ability to obtain additional funds 
the company believes its near term capital requirements can be met through its existing cash balances  cash provided by operations  its borrowing arrangements and additional equipment lease financing 
however  the company s operating cash flow is impacted by the company s comparable store sales increases or decreases 
in comparable store sales declined and in comparable store sales  excluding the extra rd week of sales in  declined 
the company expects comparable store sales to improve  but there can be no assurance that comparable store sales will improve 
in addition  the company may seek additional financing to provide greater flexibility 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional financing when needed on acceptable terms or at all 
to the extent operating cash flow declines  or financing cannot be obtained  the company intends to curtail its expansion plans in and beyond 
inflation many of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal and state minimum wage laws 
accordingly  increases in the minimum wage could materially increase the company s labor costs 
in addition  the cost of food commodities utilized by the company are subject to market supply and demand pressures 
shifts in these costs may have a significant impact on the company s food costs 
the company anticipates that increases in these costs may be offset through pricing and other cost control efforts  however  there is no assurance that the company would be able to pass such costs on to its guests or that even if it were able to do so  it could do so in a short period of time

and has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments to hedge such risks 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
if market rates were to increase immediately by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the company s borrowings would not be materially affected as borrowings are primarily subject to variable interest rates
