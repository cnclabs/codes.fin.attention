item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have not been profitable from operations since inception and have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million through december  while we were profitable in the third and fourth quarters of as a result of gains recognized from the sale of our sales force and the purchase of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes due  we had a net loss allocable to common stockholders of approximately million for the year ended december  losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities  general and administrative expenses and sales and marketing expenses 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over the next several years 
since inception  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research  sales and marketing and product development programs 
in the first eight months of  we earned detailing fees of approximately million for promoting nasacort aq and allegra  two products owned by aventis pharmaceuticals inc aventis 
we stopped promoting nasacort aq and allegra at the end of august as a result of the sale of our sales force  we will earn no future revenue from detailing aventis or other products and we have accounted for all nasacort aq and allegra promotion related activities as discontinued sales operations 
we have generated no revenues from sales of our own products and have been dependent upon funding primarily from equity and debt financing 
in january  we announced that viropharma and wyeth recently initiated a phase i clinical study to evaluate our lead hcv product candidate  hcv we anticipate having data that will allow us to assess the antiviral activity of hcv by mid if the data from this study are supportive  the companies plan to advance hcv into additional studies in hcv infected patients in mid we cannot assure you that data from our ongoing phase clinical study for hcv will warrant advancing this compound into additional studies in hcv infected patients 
viropharma and wyeth are advancing several distinct compound classes shown to inhibit viral replication activities in preclinical studies  and expect at least one additional compound to enter human trials by the end of in march  we submitted an application for orphan drug designation for oral picovir in the treatment of life threatening chronic enteroviral meningoencephalitis in patients with agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia caused by primary immune deficiency cema 
since august  we have made picovir available on an open label basis for patients with severe or life threatening diseases caused by picornaviruses 
cema patients comprise a portion of the patients enrolled in our compassionate use program 
in addition  we announced that we are continuing to explore ways to maximize the value of picovir by evaluating an intranasal approach to treating the common cold 
viropharma is in discussions with potential partners for this program 
we do not intend to fund any additional significant clinical development of picovir for the treatment of the common cold without a partner 
also in january  we announced that we have decided to discontinue the development of our phase and pre clinical rsv compounds 
this decision was based on the combination of the cost of advancing the program and the timeframe to commercialization 
we are actively seeking to out license our rsv assets 
in august  we announced a restructuring of our operations  and we and aventis mutually agreed to terminate our collaboration for picovir 
as part of the restructuring  we reduced our workforce by approximately  which included selling our sales force to aventis and reductions in development  commercial operations and administration 
we also announced that we do not intend to fund any additional significant clinical development of picovir for the treatment of the common cold without a new partner and that we will focus our resources on the continued development of our hcv product candidates with wyeth  the exploration of alternatives regarding the future development of picovir for the treatment of diseases caused by picornaviruses  and pursuing new research and development opportunities to expand our pipeline 

table of contents under our agreement with aventis that ended our collaboration to co develop and co promote picovir  aventis returned picovir to us  and both parties received mutual releases of all obligations without incurring termination fees 
aventis has compensated us for aventis current share of development and commercial expenses through july and our detailing fees through august  and we returned to aventis advance milestone payments of million 
aventis also purchased million shares of our common stock with a fair market value of million 
in a separate agreement  aventis acquired our sales force for million 
the sales force promoted products from the aventis respiratory portfolio  nasacort aq and the allegra family  through august in accordance with the terms of the aforementioned agreements  the company and aventis offset all amounts due to each other with respect to the settlement  purchase of stock and sale of the sales force 
as a result of our restructuring  we expect our expenses and operating losses in to be lower than we experienced during the first eight months of our expected decreases in expenses and operating losses will be due to lower development  marketing  sales and general and administrative expenses 
as a result of our restructuring  we expect to have sufficient cash available at the beginning of to fund our planned business operations and debt service requirements for an additional three years 
in order to improve our capital structure and reduce annual interest expense  in our board of directors approved a convertible note repurchase program to spend up to million to purchase a portion of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due through december   we have purchased an aggregate of million in principal amount of our convertible notes for approximately million 
we may  in our discretion  purchase additional notes in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time as market conditions warrant 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to purchase any additional notes at prices favorable to us  or at all 
our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on developing and obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  successfully commercializing such product candidates which may include entering into collaborative agreements for product development and commercialization  and securing contract manufacturing services and distribution and logistics services 
we will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our business activities and fund our debt service obligations beyond in march and may  we and certain of our directors were named as defendants in purported class actions filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
in july  these actions were consolidated into a single complaint 
the plaintiffs in these actions have alleged that certain statements by us about picovir were misleading 
a judgment against us could materially exceed the coverage which may be available under our directors and officers liability insurance 
we filed a motion to dismiss this action in august we are vigorously defending ourselves against this action and believe we have meritorious defenses against these claims 
while it is not feasible to predict the outcome of this claim at this time  the ultimate resolution of this action could require substantial payment by the company which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and the resolution of this matter during a specific period could have a material adverse effect on the quarterly or annual operating results for that period 
to date no liability related to this matter has been reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies 
critical policies and practices are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
due to the nature of our business and our stage of development  we do not currently face the many complex or subjective judgments that 
table of contents face companies that are further along in their life cycle that may be necessary in applying accounting policies 
our decision to apply apb opinion no 
to account for our stock option plans rather than sfas no 
is one area where our practice could be construed to be critical 
had we applied sfas no 
our net loss allocable to common shareholders in  and would have been increased by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we commenced operations in december we are a development stage company and  other than detailing fees from discontinued sales operations earned in the first eight months of for promoting products owned by aventis  we have not generated revenues from product sales 
the cash flows used in operations historically have been applied to research and development activities and the supporting picovir marketing and general and administrative expenses 
we expect that the most significant sources of our near term operating expenses will be discovery and development activities with our hepatitis c program  the exploration of alternatives regarding the future development of picovir for the treatment of life threatening chronic meningoencephalitis in patients with agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia caused by primary immune deficiency cema  and business development activities seeking new opportunities to expand our pipeline 
we do not expect significant future expenses on our rsv candidates due to our decision to discontinue the development of our phase and pre clinical rsv compounds 
this decision was based on the combination of the cost of advancing the program and the timeframe to commercialization 
we are actively seeking to out license our rsv assets

table of contents in and early  we entered into a series of commercial supply agreements with picovir bulk drug and finished product manufacturers 
we have concluded two of these arrangements with the respective manufacturers and have paid approximately million during to conclude the arrangements 
we believe we have no further financial obligations under these arrangements 
in august  we and aventis mutually agreed to end our collaboration to co develop and co promote picovir 
under the agreement  aventis returned picovir to us  and both parties received mutual releases of all obligations without incurring termination fees 
aventis has compensated us for their share of development and commercial expenses through july and our detailing fees through august  and we returned to aventis advance milestone payments of million 
aventis also purchased million shares of our common stock with a fair market value of million 
in a separate agreement  aventis acquired our sales force for a payment to us of approximately million 
the sales force promoted products from the aventis respiratory portfolio  nasacort aq and the allegra family  through august  in accordance with the terms of the aforementioned agreements  the company and aventis offset all amounts due to each other with respect to the settlement  purchase of stock and sale of the sales force 
as a result of our restructuring  particularly the termination of our co promotion and co development agreement with aventis and our decision not to fund any additional significant clinical development of picovir for the treatment of the common cold without a new partner  we expect our expenses and operating losses in to be lower than we experienced during the first eight months of our expected decreases in expenses and operating losses would be due to lower development  marketing  sales and general and administrative expenses 
as a result of our restructuring  we expect to have sufficient cash available at the beginning of to fund our planned business operations and debt service requirements for an additional three years 
our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on developing and obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  successfully commercializing such product candidates which may include entering into collaborative agreements for product development and commercialization  and securing contract manufacturing  distribution and logistics  sales and marketing services 
in june  we announced that we and wyeth extended the screening phase of our hcv drug discovery  development and commercialization agreement for up to an additional two years 
we will continue to fund the development of additional compounds under our collaboration agreement with wyeth 
wyeth pays a substantial portion of the collaboration s hcv research and development expenses

there can be no assurance that we will be able to purchase any additional notes at prices favorable to us  or at all 
as a result of our repurchase of million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes during the year ended december  our annual interest expense will be reduced by approximately million 
we believe that our restructuring will provide us with sufficient cash to fund our planned business operations and debt service obligations through we expect that we will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our business activities and fund our debt service and other obligations beyond to obtain this financing  we intend to access the public or private equity or debt markets or enter into additional arrangements with corporate collaborators to whom we may issue shares of our stock 
we have an effective form s universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission for the potential additional issuance of up to approximately million of our securities 
the registration statement provides 
table of contents us with the flexibility to determine the type of security we choose to sell  including common stock  preferred stock  warrants and debt securities  as well as the ability to time such sales when market conditions are favorable 
in order for us to issue securities registered on this registration statement we must either have an aggregate market value of the voting and non voting common equity excluding shares held by our affiliates of million or more  or we must file a post effective amendment to the registration statement on form s or s if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  the terms and prices for these financings may be much more favorable to the new investors than the terms obtained by our existing stockholders 
these financings also may dilute the ownership of existing stockholders 
additional financing  however  may not be available on acceptable terms from any source as a result of  among other factors  our failure to achieve regulatory approval of picovir  our inability to generate revenue through our existing collaborative agreements  the existence of pending litigation involving allegations of securities fraud  and our inability to file  prosecute  defend and enforce any patent claim and or other intellectual property rights 
if sufficient additional financing is not available  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate current research and development programs  or reduce or eliminate other aspects of our business 
additionally  wyeth is required to purchase our common stock at the time of completion of certain product development events pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement 
however  in the event we are not able to successfully achieve the product development or regulatory approval events  this additional financing would not be available to us 
future contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  are as follows contractual obligations payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total we lease our corporate and research and development facilities under an operating lease expiring in we also have the right  under certain circumstances  to purchase the facility

we are currently exploring several potential opportunities  including subleasing  related to its use 
we cannot be certain that we will find a use for the facility or that we will be able to sublease the facility on favorable terms or at all 
in november  we entered into an automobile fleet leasing arrangement for our former sales force 
the lease was secured with a two year million letter of credit which was further collateralized with a million investment at the lending institution that issued the letter of credit 
the investment is restricted over the term of the letter of credit

recently issued accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a business segment as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
for example  sfas no 
provides guidance on how long lived assets that are used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of apb no 
on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles assets 
we adopted sfas no 
in the adoption of sfas no 
had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas no 
is largely unchanged from sfas no 
 however we applied sfas in determining the treatment of our discontinued sales operations 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements 
other than the disclosure modification  sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
