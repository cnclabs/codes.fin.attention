item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview harris interactive provides market research  polling and consulting services to a broad range of companies  non profit organizations and governmental agencies 
since  we have provided these services utilizing traditional market research and polling methodologies  such as direct mail  telephone based surveys  mall intercepts  focus groups and in person interviews 
in september  we began developing our internet panel and building the technology infrastructure to provide online market research and polling services 
in november  we introduced our first internet based market research and polling services 
we generally perform traditional and internet based custom research services on a fixed fee basis in response to client generated requests 
we sell our multi client research services on a periodic subscription basis  typically annually 
harris interactive service bureau also performs research for other market research firms on a project by project basis in response to requests from those firms 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the most significant of these areas involving difficult or complex judgments made by management with respect to the preparation of the company s financial statements for fiscal include revenue recognition  provision for uncollectible accounts  valuation of intangible assets and other long lived assets  valuation of goodwill realizability of deferred tax assets  and hipoints tm loyalty program 
in each situation  management is required to make estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
revenue under fixed fee arrangements is recognized on a proportional performance basis based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
this revenue includes amounts billed to our clients to cover subcontractor costs and other direct expenses 
provisions for estimated contract losses  if any  are made in the period such losses are determined 
subscription revenue is recognized upon delivery of the research results 
revisions to estimated costs and differences between actual contract losses and estimated contract losses would affect both the timing of revenue allocated and the results of operations of the company 
the company maintains provisions for uncollectible accounts and estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to remit payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  thereby resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company assesses the carrying value of its identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets or their physical condition  and significant adverse industry or market trends 
in the event that the carrying value of an asset is determined to be unrecoverable  the company would record an adjustment to the respective carrying value 
with respect to goodwill  the company completes an impairment test on an annual basis 
in performing this annual test  the company compares the fair value of its reporting units with each reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
in the event that a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  the company would record an adjustment to the respective reporting unit s goodwill for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value 
in addition to the annual impairment analysis  the company also assesses the carrying value of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the valuation allowance and potential realization of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in the determination of the valuation allowance  the company has considered future taxable income 
as a result of the company s operating performance in fiscal and the more favorable near term outlook for profitability  a portion of the valuation allowance was reversed with the resultant benefit to income and goodwill 
should the company determine that it is more likely than not that it will realize additional deferred tax assets in the future  an additional adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance  with the resultant benefit to income  goodwill and additional paid in capital 
further financial information about income taxes is included in note  income taxes  to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
since july  the company has had a loyalty program hipoints tm  whereby points are awarded to market survey respondents who register for the company s online panel  complete online surveys and refer others to join the online panel 
the earned points  which are non transferable  may be redeemed for gifts from a specific product folio 
the company maintains a reserve for its obligations with respect to future redemption of outstanding points  calculated based on the expected redemption rate of the points 
this expected redemption rate is estimated based on research from other loyalty and retention programs and the company s actual redemption rates to date 
an actual redemption rate that differs from this estimated redemption rate may have a material impact on the results of operations of the company 
business combinations on november  the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock  par value 
per share  of total research corporation total research  a delaware corporation  headquartered in princeton  new jersey  pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  dated as of august   among the company  total merger sub inc  a delaware corporation and direct  wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and total research 
pursuant to the merger agreement  total merger sub was merged with and into total research the merger  with total research continuing as the surviving corporation and as a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
harris interactive and total research are engaged in complementary businesses in the market research and polling industry 
the acquisition has created revenue growth  cost savings and other synergies including the ability to convert total research traditional based clients to the internet  sell to one another s customers  offer customers more comprehensive and diverse services  and use a combined worldwide network 
for example  the company was able to build on total research s prior relationship with a key customer to win unrelated internet based work in excess of million over the past year 
upon consummation of the merger  each outstanding share of total research common stock was converted into the right to receive shares of harris interactive common stock  par value 
per share 
an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock  with an estimated fair value of million  was issued to the stockholders of total research corporation 
the value was determined using the average fair market value of the stock for the range of trading days beginning august  and ending august  additionally  pursuant to the merger agreement  all outstanding options to purchase shares of total research common stock were  upon consummation of the merger  fully vested and converted into an option to purchase shares of harris interactive common stock 
as a result  the former option holders of total research received from harris interactive options to purchase approximately  shares of harris interactive common stock  with an estimated fair value of million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with fas and is included in the company s financial statements commencing on november  the company has recorded approximately million in goodwill and intangibles related to the acquisition in accordance with the provisions of sfas in september   the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of m a create limited  a privately owned company headquartered in tokyo  japan  in consideration of a combination of cash and shares of harris interactive common stock 
additionally  in august   the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of market research solutions limited  a privately owned uk company  headquartered in oxford  england  in consideration of a combination of cash and shares of harris interactive common stock  and in february  the company acquired all of the assets of the custom research group of yankelovich partners  inc  headquartered in norwalk  connecticut 
restructuring and asset impairment charge during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a restructuring and asset write down charge of million directly related to the operational integration of harris interactive and total research 
management developed a formal plan that included a reduction in harris interactive staff of the full time workforce in rochester  ny  new york  ny  norwalk  ct and a few other outlying locations 
the affected employees were mainly support staff with overlapping functions in the combined company 
other integration actions included the closing of our telephone center located in youngstown  oh and offices in new york  ny and chicago  il  which resulted in asset write downs and a reserve for lease commitments at these locations 
the plan was formally communicated to the affected employees during the second fiscal quarter of the company realized approximately million in non cash savings and million in cash savings in fiscal in fiscal the company realized non cash savings of approximately million and cash savings of approximately million 
the following table summarizes activity with respect to the restructuring and asset impairment charge for the period ended june  in thousands asset lease severance write downs commitments total net charge fiscal     asset write offs during fiscal   cash payments during fiscal   remaining reserve at june    cash payments during fiscal  fiscal adjustments remaining reserve at june  as of june   all actions were completed  however cash payments for lease commitments have been  and will continue to be  made on a longer term basis according to the contractually scheduled payments of such commitments and will continue through during fiscal  the company adjusted the reserve for restructuring charges by  for lease commitments that were no longer required 
the adjustments were due to the company obtaining a release from its obligations under lease obligations previously included in restructuring charges 
the total number of employees included in the charge and ultimately terminated was results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated our results of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue year ended june  revenue from services cost of services gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring credits charges and asset write downs operating income loss interest and other income  net net income loss before taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from services 
total fiscal revenue increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase in revenue was primarily driven by the million increase in us revenue  or  to million for fiscal the increased us revenue was partially attributable to the incremental revenue generated from the acquisition of total research as well as overall growth in several us markets  most prominently healthcare and customer loyalty management 
additionally  excluding the total research acquisition  the company recognized a modest increase in us revenue related to our expanding internet client base and internet based market research services  which contributed million in total us internet based revenue for fiscal  as compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
revenue for the united kingdom increased from the prior year by million  or  to million in fiscal revenue for japan increased million  or  to million in fiscal the increase in uk revenue was primarily attributable to the incremental revenue generated from the acquisition of total research in november revenue from japan increased due to the continued benefit we derived from new contracts with selected customers throughout fiscal gross profit 
gross profit was million  or of revenue  for fiscal  compared with million  or of revenue  for fiscal the improvement in gross margin percentage resulted primarily from the growth in internet related business relative to overall revenue growth 
revenue from internet based services was million  or of total revenue  in fiscal  compared with million  or of revenue  for fiscal this increase in internet revenue was due in part to the acquisition of new internet based projects as well as the conversion of existing  traditional work to the internet 
additionally  through increasing the level of internet related work  the company has been able to use our existing panel for research in place of more expensive outsourcing and telephone costs 
hisb has also played a significant role in the growth of internet revenue 
hisb projects generate higher gross margins due to the fact that they are data collection only and typically do not include as much professional time as customer internet based research work 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal were million  or of revenue  compared with million  or of revenue  for fiscal as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased three percentage points 
the decrease is attributable to reductions in headcount and related expenses  reflecting the company s continuing efforts to reduce costs  as well as productivity improvements from the increased experience level of the company s sales force with harris interactive sales and marketing strategies 
the company has been able to maintain a consistent level of sales and marketing costs as a percentage of sales throughout the fiscal year despite increased fiscal fourth quarter expenditures for incentive compensation and severance related costs 
the severance related costs were associated with reorganizing our uk management team and the closing of one of our four uk offices 
the additional incentive compensation expense resulted from increased full year revenue results as compared to budget that led to increased commissions and bonuses to employees in accordance with the company s compensation plans 
in total annual expenditures in fiscal continue to support the company s overall business model established in the prior year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenue  in fiscal compared with million  or of revenue  for fiscal the ten percentage point decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects reductions in headcount and related expenses  rent expense and depreciation expense  and reflects the company s continuing efforts to reduce costs 
depreciation and equipment rental and maintenance expenses decreased by a combined million  or  to million in fiscal primarily as a result of the fixed asset write offs in connection with the company s fiscal second quarter restructuring charge which reduced the level of gross fixed assets 
the restructuring plan also reduced fiscal rent expense by million as a result of the closing of three of our telephone centers 
as part of its cost savings efforts  the company has eliminated all but two telephone centers in the united states and the united kingdom  retaining one in each country primarily to support committed projects with longer term  predictable needs 
the balance of telephone data collection has been migrated to lower cost providers  including some in foreign countries 
the cost savings from the prior year restructuring plan were partially offset by increased database development costs related to the establishment of our western european panel as well as the continued expansion of our us panel  which are expected to continue in fiscal interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income totaled million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a lower average marketable securities balance and interest rates for fiscal compared to fiscal income tax benefit 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal as compared to a minimal expense in fiscal for financial reporting purposes  in fiscal the company was able to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to apply against current year net income  resulting in substantially no current income tax expense 
the recorded benefit in was as a result of the partial reversal of the valuation allowance on the company s deferred tax assets 
since the deferred tax assets were substantially comprised of net operating loss carryforwards and it was determined that it is more likely than not that we will utilize additional net operating losses in the near future  as required by gaap a portion of the valuation allowance was reversed in due to operating losses in fiscal no benefit was recognized in that fiscal year 
fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from services 
revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the revenue growth was mainly due to the acquisitions of total research in november of fiscal  the yankelovich custom research group in february of fiscal  and market research solutions limited and m a create limited in august of fiscal in fiscal  the company also increased internet based revenue to million  from million in fiscal acquiring new internet based revenue as well as converting existing  traditional work to the internet drove this increase 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to in fiscal  from in fiscal the margins declined primarily because a large majority of the revenue derived from acquisitions was generated from traditional research as opposed to internet based research 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million for fiscal  or of revenue  compared with million  or of revenue for fiscal the absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and related expenses resulting from the acquisition of total research and an increase in sales commission expense 
the improvement as a percentage of revenue is attributable to the company s continuing efforts to reduce overall costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenue in fiscal  compared with million  or of revenue in fiscal similar to sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses excluding database development costs have increased in absolute dollars due to increased personnel and related costs  including rent and depreciation expense  resulting from the acquisition of total research 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue was directly attributable to continuing cost reduction efforts including the fiscal  second quarter restructuring plan 
internet database development costs declined million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to significant expenditures to build our us database in fiscal  the decreased price to acquire double opt in names for database replenishment in fiscal  the termination of our panel recruitment agreement with during fiscal  and the elimination of costs associated with the planet project global poll conducted in november interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income totaled million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a lower average marketable securities balance for fiscal as compared to fiscal significant factors affecting company performance in the past  the company has reported ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  which is a non gaap financial measure as defined under sec regulation g 
the company has reported ebitda because management believes that ebitda  although not a gaap measurement  is widely understood and is an additional tool that assists investors in evaluating current operating performance of the business without the effect of the non cash depreciation and amortization expenses 
management internally monitors ebitda to monitor cash flow unencumbered by non cash items 
while instructive  ebitda should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  operating income  net income or cash flows from operations or any other gaap measure of performance or liquidity 
globally  for fiscal  ebitda was million  or of revenue  compared to the fiscal and ebitda losses of million and million  or and of revenue  respectively  as reconciled with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap within the following table 
year ended june  net income loss    less interest and other income  net   plus income tax benefit expense  plus depreciation and amortization    ebitda    net income loss as a of revenue ebitda as a of revenue by comparison  a published index reports average ebitda as a percentage of revenue of for the us market research industry as a whole for the calendar year ended december  the primary factors driving the growth in the company s gross profit  ebitda and net income loss are growth in revenue and the mix of the revenue derived from internet versus traditional work 
the company s model is based upon the premise that internet work is more profitable than traditional work  due to the comparatively low variable data collection cost of internet work 
the model  which the company believes reasonably represents comparability of traditional and internet based projects  is as follows traditional internet based revenue less cost of services as a of revenue direct payroll variable data collection variable gross profit as a of revenue in addition to the variable data collection costs  the internet based model has additional fixed costs associated with the development and maintenance of underlying databases and internet technology 
such costs decrease net income and ebitda for internet based work 
in general  however  due to the interplay between the variable and fixed components of cost  the premise is that  as the percentage of internet work increases  and assuming that project professional service components and pricing are comparable and operating expenses continue to be managed in the ordinary course  net income and ebitda as a percentage of revenue should also increase 
based upon the operation of the model  the company believes that net operating margins of its business can grow steadily over a period of years with a potential as high as ebitda in the range of high teens to 
such growth is predicated upon the company s global mix of internet based versus traditional work  continued growth of revenue with the ability to continue to achieve reasonable pricing  controlled growth of operating expenses  and maintenance and continued growth of the respondent database sufficient to support the company s business at reasonable per unit costs 
the model should be viewed as illustrative and not as an actual measure or predictor of any particular project or the company s projects as a whole at any given point in time 
regarding the company s ability to continue to generate revenue  the company must constantly develop new business  both for growth and to replace non renewed projects 
although work for no one client constitutes more than of the company s revenue  the company has had to  and in the future will likely have to  find significant amounts of replacement and additional revenue as customer relationships and work for continuing customers change 
the company s ability to generate revenue is dependent not only on execution of its business plan but also on general market factors outside of its control 
many of our clients treat all or a portion of their market research expenditures as discretionary 
as a result  as economic conditions decline in any of our markets  our ability to generate revenue is adversely impacted 
the company believes that its ability to continue to sustain and grow revenue is significantly affected by client satisfaction with completed work  and that improved client satisfaction ratings have had and will continue to have a positive impact on the growth of the company s business 
we have instituted what we believe are among the most comprehensive systems to measure client satisfaction in our industry 
we use information provided by our clients to improve the quality of our products  services  and relationships  and therefore to improve future satisfaction levels 
as the company matured in the conversion of its business model to the internet  we have been able to improve client satisfaction scores to over out of  among the top in our industry 
we believe that such improvements have had a direct result in greater customer loyalty and an increased rate of customer acceptance of our proposals 
regarding the mix of work  for fiscal  the company s actual internet mix was on a global basis and in the united states alone 
the company considers all of the revenue from a project to be internet based whenever or more of the surveys were completed over the internet 
although the company continues to work to convert projects to the internet in the united states  the primary new growth opportunity is in europe  where the ability to change the internet mix is dependent upon the company s success in expanding the size of its respondent panel and increase customer acceptance of internet based work 
the globalization of the internet portion of the company s business has commenced and we believe that it is expected to ramp up over the next several years 
the company s global database of more than million internet survey respondents continues to be a critical component of its success 
the company believes that its multi million participant us database  to which it is adding between  and  names per day on average  continues to be adequate to service its internet based business 
in fiscal  the company launched an initiative to build a european database as well 
to that end  it has entered into name acquisition agreements with a major internet portal and others 
names are being added regularly to the european database  which included approximately  names as of july  and the company is now conducting internet based projects in europe 
the company intends to continue to expand the european panel in fiscal and beyond in order to support growth of internet based research in europe and is currently adding more than  names per day 
additionally  in both the us and in europe  the company intends to continue efforts to enhance existing and build new specialty panels 
for example  it has entered into joint development activities with ims health  inc to build physician specialty panels 
the amount of the company s investments in names for its databases will continue to vary  particularly quarter by quarter  based upon factors such as panel availability  opportunities that arise for acquisition or development of panels in specialty or under represented groups  and attrition 
internet databases by their nature experience participant attrition 
there are no standard measurement systems for such attrition  particularly in the internet survey response field 
measurement involves complex variables 
for example  determining attrition  by lack of response from a panelist for a set length of time since last contact  is not necessarily reflective of expected long term attrition 
the panelist may not have had an interest in responding regarding particular survey topics offered over a period of time but may  after an absence  respond to a later survey covering a topic of particular interest to the respondent 
thus  percentage rates of attrition may not be comparable or meaningful within the industry 
when the company first developed its internet model  it expected attrition of panel members to be in the range of annually 
with the company s increased expertise gained from several years of investment in panel management techniques  it monitors panel fatigue and attrition in multiple ways 
its overall attrition rates by most measures  however  are significantly less than originally anticipated 
liquidity and capital resources prior to fiscal we financed our operations primarily through the million of net proceeds generated from our december initial public offering 
consequently  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were million at june   and million at june  in fiscal the company generated positive cash flows for the first time in recent years and as a result our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were at june  net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the positive cash flow in fiscal was primarily as a result of the company generating net income in fiscal as compared to the funding of net losses in fiscal and net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal as compared with net cash provided by investing activities of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal the company s investing activities included the net purchase of additional marketable securities of approximately million as well as capital expenditures of million 
during fiscal  net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of million were partially offset by capital expenditures of million and the million cash outflow for transaction related costs to acquire total research in november during fiscal  net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of million were partially offset by capital expenditures of million and the million cash outflow to purchase the custom research division of yankelovich partners  inc in february fiscal  and capital expenditures primarily supported the development of our internet infrastructure in the us in fiscal the company had net cash provided by financing activities of million 
the company received cash of million in fiscal as a result of issuances of common stock and stock option exercises  this was offset by the repayment of million in short and long term borrowings 
net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal was primarily related to the repayment of long term debt of million and the repurchase of  shares of common stock for million  these cash outflows were partially offset by million provided by the issuance of common stock and stock option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  resulting from issuances of common stock and stock options of million  offset by the repurchase of common stock of million 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our services  the resources we allocate to the continuing development of our internet infrastructure and internet panel  marketing and selling of our services  our promotional activities  our acquisition activities and other factors 
management anticipates continuing expenditures for property  plant and equipment and working capital requirements throughout fiscal at levels consistent with fiscal as of june  the company had no short term or long term borrowings 
at june   the company had short term and long term borrowings of million and million  respectively  limited to operations in the united kingdom and japan 
interest rates related to the borrowings ranged from to 
there were no restrictive covenants associated with these borrowings 
in fiscal and  the company had  and continues to maintain  a line of credit with a commercial bank providing borrowing availability up to million  at the prime interest rate 
the prime rate in effect at june  was 
borrowings under this arrangement are due upon demand 
there were no borrowings under this agreement at june  and june  the line of credit is collateralized by the assets of the company 
based on current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements to support the company s planned operations for the foreseeable future 
we cannot be certain  however  that our underlying assumed levels of revenue and expenses will be accurate 
if our operating results were to fail to meet our expectations  or if accounts receivable or other assets were to require a greater use of cash than is currently anticipated  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financing or other arrangements 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
contractual cash obligations in thousands the company s consolidated contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of june  are as follows payments due by period less than after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases      purchase obligations    other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period less than after total year years years years lines of credit  standby letters of credit total commercial commitments  the company s line of credit is payable upon demand under the terms of its agreement

risk factors the market research industry is vulnerable to general economic conditions 
many of our clients treat all or a portion of their market research expenditures as discretionary 
as general economic conditions decline and our customers seek to control variable costs  projects to be performed by the company may be delayed or cancelled  and new project bookings may slow 
as a result  the growth and earnings of the company may be adversely impacted 
our growth will be adversely affected if the marketplace does not continue to convert to internet based market research and polling 
the ongoing success of our business will depend on our ability to continually develop and market internet based products and services that achieve broad market acceptance 
our clients must continue to accept the internet as an attractive replacement for traditional market research methodologies  such as direct mail  telephone based surveys  mall intercepts  focus groups and in person interviews 
since the beginning of fiscal  we have spent million and significant management resources to develop and grow our internet based market research and polling business 
some of our clients have expressed concern that internet users do not yet accurately reflect their applicable population  and that any information collected via the internet will be inherently biased 
if our current and potential clients do not continue to accept our internet based methodologies as reliable and unbiased  our revenues may not meet expectations or may decline  and our business  financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer 
we face intense competitive pressures and uncertainties within the market research and polling industry 
the market research and polling industry is highly fragmented and includes competitors much larger than we are 
as competitors increase their ability to offer alternative products in the market  we may come under increasing pressures in selling and pricing our products and services 
no one customer accounts for more than of our revenues and most of our revenues are derived on a project by project basis 
we must continuously replace completed work with new projects in order to sustain and grow our revenues 
the market research industry tends to be adversely affected by slow or depressed business conditions in the market as a whole 
we are at risk of decreased market research budgets as our customers respond to difficult economic conditions  as well as to delays in projects both committed and uncommitted 
if we are unable to maintain adequate size and demographic composition of our global internet panel  or if we are required to spend substantial funds to do so  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
our success is highly dependent on our ability to obtain and retain an adequate number of worldwide panelists in our internet panel and its specialty panels 
our ability to maintain an adequate online panel or increase internet revenues may be harmed if a significant number of our current online panelists decide that they are no longer willing to participate in our surveys  we lose a large number of online panelists from over use  and then must rely on a limited number of online panelists for ongoing research  we are unable to attract an adequate number of replacement panelists and specialty panel members  or new regulatory requirements related to internet spam make it impractical for us to continue operations as currently conducted 
if the number of our active survey respondents significantly decreases  or the demographic composition of our internet panel narrows  our ability to provide our clients with accurate and statistically projectable information would likely suffer 
this risk is likely to increase as our business expands 
for example  our internet panel is surveyed for our own studies as well as for studies conducted for other market research firms by our harris interactive service bureau 
our business will be unable to grow and will suffer if we have an insufficient number of panelists to respond to our surveys  or if our panel becomes unreliable due to reduced size  or because it is not representative of the general population 
our online panelists are not obligated to participate in our surveys and polls and there can be no assurance that they will continue to do so 
we believe that our hipoints sm  histakes sm and instant results programs currently provide adequate incentives to encourage participation in our surveys and to maintain the size of our internet panel 
these programs may lose their effectiveness in the future  resulting in a reduction in size of the panel 
if we are unable to achieve the anticipated global growth of our internet panel  or if we are unable to overcome other risks associated with global operations  we will be unable to conduct business on a global level 
key components of our strategy are extension of our internet based market research and polling products and services to clients globally  expansion of our internet panel to include global online panelists and development of strategic alliances globally 
the following risks are inherent in doing business on a global level inability to attract a critical mass of panel members in key countries and regions  particularly in europe  export controls relating to encryption technology  inability to comply with or enactment of more restrictive privacy laws  changes in regulatory requirements  currency exchange fluctuations  problems in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  potentially adverse tax consequences  political instability  internet access restrictions  and anti american sentiment or terrorist activity against american interests abroad 
we have little or no control over these risks 
we have encountered more restrictive privacy laws in connection with our business operations in europe  which have inhibited our ability to develop our european internet panel 
we have also experienced currency exchange fluctuations  the impact of which has not been material 
as we increase our global operations in the future  we may experience some or all of these risks  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not continue to keep pace with rapid technological change within the market research and polling industry  we will not be able to successfully implement our business plan 
the markets for our products and services are highly competitive 
our current competitors also offer internet based and traditional market research and polling services 
we expect to face future competition from other organizations that develop internet related products and services 
these companies may  either alone or in alliances with other firms  penetrate the internet based market research and polling market 
our ongoing success will depend on our continued ability to improve the performance features and reliability of our products and services 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new products and services 
we could also incur substantial costs if we need to modify our services or infrastructure to adapt to these changes 
any failure in the performance of our internet based technology infrastructure could harm our business 
any system failure  including network  software or hardware failure  that causes an interruption in our ability to communicate with our internet panel  collect research data  or protect visual materials included in our surveys  could result in reduced revenue  and could impair our reputation 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  earthquake  flooding  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins and similar events 
one supplier of our secure off site web hosting facilities currently maintains approximately one third of our servers at one facility  and while we have redundancy in our systems we depend upon the supplier and others to protect our systems and operations from the events described above 
we have experienced technical difficulties and downtime of individual components of our computer system in the past and believe that technical difficulties and downtime may occur from time to time in the future 
although technical difficulties and downtime have had minimal impact on our operations during the past fiscal year  their impact may be more severe in the future 
we have no formal disaster recovery plan and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to failures in our systems 
in addition  our servers and software must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic 
any increase in demands on our servers beyond that which we currently anticipate  will require us to fund the expansion and modification of our network infrastructure 
if we were unable to add additional software and hardware to accommodate increased demand  unanticipated system disruptions and slower data collection would likely result 
our internet panel members communicate with us using various internet service providers 
these providers have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties unrelated to our systems in the future 
major components of the internet backbone itself could fail due to terrorist attack  war or natural disaster 
while the impact of these outages in the past has been minimal  any future system delays or failures in the internet could adversely affect our access to our online panelists  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
sustaining our growth may strain our managerial and systems resources 
we have grown rapidly and need to continue to grow in all areas of our operations 
managing and sustaining our growth will place significant demands on management as well as on our administrative  operational  technical and financial systems and controls 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we will not be able to successfully implement our business plan at projected levels 
we must continue to attract and retain highly skilled employees 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing  sales and client support personnel 
competition for these personnel exists  and we may be unable to attract  integrate or retain the proper numbers of sufficiently qualified personnel that our business plan assumes 
we have experienced in the past  and we may experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications 
in the past  competition for highly skilled employees has resulted in additional costs for recruitment  compensation and relocation or the provision of remote access to our facilities 
to the extent that we are unable to hire and retain skilled employees in the future  our business  financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could disrupt our operations and result in loss of revenues 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our key technical and senior management personnel 
the loss of the services of any of these persons could seriously harm our business 
although some of our key employees have signed non competitive agreements  only a few of our employees are currently bound by an employment agreement 
all of our other relationships with our officers and key employees are at will 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees other than gordon s 
black 
our succession plans may not be successfully executed 
we have started our search to identify potential candidates for chief executive officer 
the hiring of a new ceo would allow gordon s 
black  the current ceo  to move to a position as executive chairman and more fully concentrate on corporate strategy  major account marketing  international expansion 
investor relations  and acquisition 
if the succession plans for the ceo and other senior executives are not successfully executed  and appropriate replacement s cannot be hired  the senior management may be overtaxed and unable to properly execute all of their duties 
our business is largely dependent on the continued development and worldwide growth of the internet 
the internet may not grow  or may be unable to support the demands placed on it by this growth 
if worldwide internet usage does not continue to grow  we may be unable to attract international online panelists to our internet panel or clients for our internet based market research and polling products and services 
if internet usage does continue to grow  the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline 
varying factors could inhibit future growth or the ability of the internet infrastructure to adequately support the growth in internet usage  including inadequate network infrastructure  security concerns  inconsistent quality of service  and unavailability of cost effective  high speed service 
our internet panel depends on internet service providers  online service providers and other website operators for access to the internet and our websites 
many websites have experienced interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure 
if worldwide internet usage declines  or grows at a significantly slower rate than projected  our ability to maintain our current internet panel  expand our global internet panel and gather research data and information around the world will decrease  which would likely harm our business financial condition and results of operations 
a breach of our internet security measures or security concerns could adversely affect our business 
internet security concerns could cause some online panelists to reduce their participation levels  provide inaccurate responses or end their membership in our internet panel 
this could harm our credibility with our current clients 
if our clients become dissatisfied  they may stop using our products and services 
in addition  dissatisfied and lost clients could damage our reputation 
a loss of online panelists or a loss of clients would hurt our efforts to generate increased revenues 
a failure in our security measures could result in the misappropriation of private data 
as a result  we may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure or inability to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business 
our success and ability to compete depends substantially on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
we have registered a number of our trademarks  including harris interactive and the harris poll 
if we were prevented from using the harris poll name  our brand recognition and business would likely suffer 
we would have to make substantial financial expenditures to promote and rebuild our brand identity 
currently  we have pending trademark applications for a number of our products and services 
we also have patent applications currently pending for our conceptloc encryption system and our system and method for conducting product configuration research over a computer based network 
in addition  we may apply for additional trademarks or patents in the future 
our patent or trademark applications may not be approved  or if approved  our patents or trademarks may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
we cannot guarantee that infringement or other claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future  whether resulting from our internally developed intellectual property or licenses or content from third parties 
any future assertions or prosecutions could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to pay money damages  introduce new trademarks  develop non infringing technology  or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
any of those events could substantially increase our operating expenses and potentially reduce our expected revenues 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with parties with whom we do business  and generally control access to  and distribution of  our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure  parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our technologies 
the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we also rely on off the shelf technologies that we license from third parties 
off the shelf technology refers to generally commercially available software that is not customized for a particular user 
these third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the inability to use licensed technology important to our business could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost 
in the future  we may seek to license additional technology to enhance our current technology infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that any such licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the loss of any of these technology licenses could result in delays in providing our products and services until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated 
we may be subject to liability for publishing or distributing content over the internet 
we may be subject to claims relating to content that is published on or downloaded from our websites 
we also could be subject to liability for content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites 
we may be accused of sending bulk unsolicited email  and have our email blocked by many isps and therefore be unable to conduct online data collection 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type  such as defamation or trademark infringement  or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
in addition  any claims of this type  with or without merit  would result in the diversion of our financial resources and management personnel 
liability arising from the use of the personal information of our internet panel could be costly 
we could be subject to liability claims by our online panelists for any misuse of personal information 
these claims could result in costly litigation 
in addition  the federal trade commission and other domestic and international agencies have been investigating various internet companies regarding their use of personal information 
we could incur additional costs and expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if our privacy practices are investigated 
changes in government regulation or industry practices could limit our internet activities or result in additional costs of doing business on the internet 
any new laws pertaining to the imposition of taxes on internet access and electronic commerce could adversely affect our business 
in february  the federal communications commission issued a declaratory ruling interpreting the telecommunications act of to allow local exchange carriers to receive reciprocal compensation for traffic delivered to information service providers  particularly internet service providers  on the basis that traffic bound for internet service providers is largely interstate 
as a result of this ruling  the costs of transmitting data over the internet may increase and our business could suffer 
as of july  at least us state legislatures had enacted laws regulating the distribution of unsolicited email 
in april  the controlling the assault of non solicited pornography and marketing act of can spam was introduced in the us senate 
this bill would require unsolicited e mail marketing messages have a valid return address 
e mail marketers would be required to remove customers from their mailing lists if requested 
the bill also give more legal ammunition for isps to take spammers to court  allows the federal trade commission ftc to impose fines  and gives state attorneys general the power to bring lawsuit 
any future legislation or regulations or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet could limit our effectiveness in conducting internet based market research and polling  and increase our operating expenses 
in addition  the application of existing laws to the internet could expose us to substantial liability for which we might not be indemnified by content providers or other third parties 
existing laws and regulations currently address  and new laws and regulations and industry self regulatory initiatives are likely to address  a variety of issues  including the following email distribution  user privacy and expression  the rights and safety of children  intellectual property  information security  anti competitive practices  the convergence of traditional channels with internet commerce  taxation and pricing  and the characteristics and quality of products and services 
those laws that do reference the internet have limited interpretation by the courts and their applicability and scope are not well defined  particularly on an international basis 
any new laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect our business 
industry standards related to the internet are still evolving 
moreover  some private entities have proposed their own standards for communications with  and use of information related to  individuals who use the internet 
internet service providers also have the ability to disrupt our communications with our panel 
although we believe that we maintain the highest standards for the recruitment of members into our database  communications with our panelists and use of information provided by our respondents  some service providers and or self appointed industry regulators may not agree 
as a result  our communications with our panelists may be disrupted from time to time 
we have incurred losses in recent years and may incur them again 
we incurred net losses of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we base current and future expense levels on our operating plans  which are based on our estimates of future revenues 
while we have been profitable for fiscal  if our revenues grow at a slower rate than we anticipate  or if our spending levels exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted to reflect slower revenue growth  we may not be able to maintain profitability 
even if we remain profitable in the future  we may be unable to maintain current profitability growth on an ongoing basis 
variations in our operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have in the past  and may in the future  fluctuate significantly 
our future results of operations may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this happens  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
factors that are outside of our control  and that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past or that may affect us in the future  include declines in general economic conditions or the budgets of our clients  a general decline in the demand for market research and polling products and services  seasonal decreases in demand for market research and polling services  development of equal or superior products and services by our competitors  technical difficulties that cause general and long term failure of the internet  and currency fluctuations 
factors that are partially within our control  and that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past or that may affect us in the future  include our relative mix of internet based and traditional market research and polling businesses  technical difficulties that negatively affect our operations  our ability to maintain the proper critical mass and scope of our internet panel necessary to develop and sell new products and services and generate expected revenues  our ability to recruit respondents into our sub panels  such as our it decision makers  to conduct high value research for our clients  and development of new  marketable products and services the factors listed above may affect both our quarter to quarter operating results as well as our long term success 
you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations or any other trend in our performance as an indication of our future results 
the price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of internet related companies have been especially volatile and these securities may be overvalued 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be subject to wide fluctuations 
if financial operating results do not improve or improve at a slower rate than we anticipate  or if operating or capital expenditures exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly  or if some other event adversely affects us  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
in addition  if the market for internet related stocks or the stock market in general experiences an additional loss in investor confidence or declines again  the market price of our common stock could fall for reasons unrelated to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
investors might be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the purchase price 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
if we were to become the subject of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
anti takeover provisions in our charter could delay or prevent an acquisition of the company 
our restated certificate of incorporation provides for the division of our board of directors into three classes and provides our board of directors with the power to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
this preferred stock could have voting rights  including voting rights that could be superior to that of our common stock  and the board of directors has the power to determine these voting rights 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law contains provisions that impose restrictions on stockholder action to acquire our company 
the effect of these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law provisions could discourage or prevent third parties from seeking to obtain control of us  including transactions in which the holders of common stock might receive a premium for their shares over prevailing market prices 
potential acquisitions of  or investments in  other companies may not be available and or have a negative impact on our business 
as part of our continued strategy to increase revenue  expand our internet panel  acquire additional intellectual capital and add to our portfolio of existing products and services  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  services  products or technologies 
we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or acquire them at reasonable prices and or on reasonable terms 
some material risks of acquisitions are difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired business  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the availability of favorable acquisition financing  and the potential loss of key employees and or customers of any acquired business 
acquisitions may require the use of significant amounts of cash  resulting in the inability to use those funds for other business purposes 
acquisitions using our capital stock could have a dilutive effect  and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
amortization of intangible assets would reduce our earnings  which in turn could negatively influence the price of our common stock 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has international sales and facilities in the united kingdom and japan and therefore  is subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
non us sales are denominated in the functional currencies of the country in which our foreign subsidiaries reside 
total consolidated assets and liabilities of the company are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for each period presented 
accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity 
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in the company s results of operations  and were not material for the periods presented 
as a result of operating in foreign markets  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions 
to the extent the company incurs expenses that are based on locally denominated sales volumes paid in local currency  the exposure to foreign exchange risk is reduced 
the company has determined that the impact of a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we have historically had very low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
while the united kingdom now contributes significantly to our revenues  we continue to believe our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risk is low 
therefore the company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the company s adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
as we continue to expand globally  the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may increase 
therefore  in the future  we will continue to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis to mitigate such risks 
the carrying values of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable and accounts payable  approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments
