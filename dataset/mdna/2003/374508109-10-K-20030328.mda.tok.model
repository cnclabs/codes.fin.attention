item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements are the selection and application of certain accounting principles  policies  and procedures that affect the amounts that are reported 
in order to apply these principles  policies  and procedures  the company must make judgments  assumptions  and estimates based on the best available information at the time 
actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events  some of which the company may have little or no control over 
in addition  the methods used in applying the above may result in amounts that differ considerably from those that would result from the application of other acceptable methods 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item certain critical accounting policies that materially affect the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements are the use of the last in  first out lifo method of valuing certain inventories  the accounting for certain environmental remediation liabilities  the accounting for certain related party transactions  and assessing the possible impairment of certain long lived assets 
lifo inventories as described in note  the company s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
costs for crude oil and refined products produced by the refineries  and lubricants and other merchandise of phoenix fuel  are determined by the lifo method 
under this method  the most recent acquisition costs are charged to cost of sales  and inventories are valued at the earliest acquisition costs 
the company selected this method because it believed it more accurately reflects the cost of the company s current sales 
the use of this method results in reported earnings that can differ significantly from those that might be reported under a different inventory method such as the first in  first out fifo method 
under the fifo method  the earliest acquisition costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at the latest acquisition costs 
if inventories had been determined using the fifo method at december    and  net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the years ended december    and would have been higher lower by  and   and  and  and  respectively 
in addition  the use of the lifo inventory method may result in increases or decreases to cost of sales in years that inventory volumes decline as the result of charging cost of sales with lifo inventory costs generated in prior periods 
for the years ended december    and  cost of sales were lower by   and  because of declines in inventory volumes 
in periods of rapidly declining prices  lifo inventories may have to be written down to market value due to the higher costs assigned to lifo volumes in prior periods 
market value is determined based on estimated selling prices less applicable refining  transportation and other selling costs  generally for the month subsequent to the end of the reporting period 
for the year ended december   declining prices resulted in the write down of inventory values by approximately  for the years ended december  and  there were no lifo inventory market value write downs 
environmental remediation liabilities the company has recorded various environmental remediation liabilities described in more detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item these liabilities result for the most part from past operations  including liabilities associated with past operations arising out of changes in environmental laws  and liabilities assumed in connection with acquired assets 
the company is conducting remediation activities in connection with these matters  including investigation  sampling  cleanup  disposal  and monitoring 
such liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
environmental liabilities are not discounted to their present value and are recorded without consideration of potential recoveries from third parties 
the company employs independent consultants or its own internal environmental personnel to investigate and assemble pertinent facts  recommend an appropriate remediation plan in light of regulatory standards  assist in estimating remediation costs based on existing technologies  and complete remediation according to approved plans 
when consultants are not utilized  the company estimates remediation costs based on the knowledge and experience of company employees having responsibility for the remediation project 
because of the amount of uncertainty involved in the company s various remediation efforts and the period of time such efforts may take to complete  estimates are based on current regulatory standards 
the company updates its estimates as needed to reflect changes in factual information  available technology  or applicable laws and regulations 
subsequent adjustments to estimates  which may be significant  often occur as more information becomes available  as the requirements of government agencies are changed or clarified  or as other circumstances change 
related party transactions the company has an outstanding loan to james e 
acridge  its former chairman  president  and chief executive officer the former ceo  as more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item as discussed in note  at december  and  the company had fully reserved for the note and related accrued interest 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
for assets to be disposed of  the company reports long lived assets at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
during and  the company recorded impairment write downs of  and  respectively  relating to assets sold or held for disposal 
additionally  the company has several operating service station convenience stores that are being marketed for potential sale if acceptable offers are received 
these operating stores were evaluated for impairment using an undiscounted cash flow methodology 
the sum of expected future cash flows for certain of the stores was less than the carrying value  accordingly impairment losses of  and  based on estimated fair market values were recorded in and  respectively 
in determining the amount of these write downs  the fair market value estimates used were based upon either internally prepared estimates based on comparable sales or sales offers received 
in addition  write downs of  were recorded for other impairments in changes in current economic conditions  assumptions regarding the timing and amounts of cash flows  or fair market value estimates could result in additional write downs of these assets in the future

outlook the company s strategy is to profitably operate its refining  retail marketing and phoenix fuel operations 
the immediate strategic focus is to efficiently integrate the yorktown refinery  which was purchased by the company in  into the company s existing operations while maximizing the profitability of all the company s refineries  work with producers in the four corners area to augment crude oil supply  maximize the profitability of the retail group by increasing sales of high margin merchandise and continuing to reduce costs  maximize the profitability of phoenix fuel by increasing wholesale fuel volumes  expanding its service offerings  and broadening its wholesale customer base  increase cash flow by continuing to reduce operating expenses and eliminating non essential capital expenditures  rationalize the company s asset base by selling non strategic and underperforming assets and selectively pursuing acquisitions  and continue the company s debt reduction strategy implemented in the company s four corners refining operations continue to be affected by reduced crude oil production in the area and could further be affected by ongoing crude oil supply contract negotiations if such negotiations are not successful in retaining volumes 
additionally  pipelines bringing refined products into this area directly impact and may continue to impact the company s earnings 
further  completion of new pipeline projects could also have an impact on the company s profitability 
the company s refineries continue to run well with no significant operational problems and have the ability to respond to changing economic conditions in order to maximize refinery netbacks 
the yorktown refinery will undergo a crude unit and coker unit turnaround commencing at the end of march these units are expected to be down for approximately three weeks 
the refinery will be operating at a reduced production rate during these activities 
in anticipation of the turnaround  the company will maintain inventories sufficient to meet its contractual requirements during the turnaround 
refining margins in the fourth quarter of showed improvement over the previous three quarters and this trend has continued into the first quarter of as refining margins continue to show improvement 
tight crude oil and finished product inventories  coupled with strong finished product demand  have contributed to improved refining margins in early the company is currently working on a longer term crude oil supply transaction that if successful will put a new to the market crude oil into the yorktown refinery at very attractive pricing  with little to no detriment to high end product yields 
this transaction may be completed as early as the fall of the company will continue to evaluate and potentially dispose of non strategic and underperforming assets in its retail operations 
the company continues to face increased competition in the markets in which it operates from major oil companies  independent oil companies  and non traditional gasoline marketers 
the company has been  and expects to continue to be  competitive in these markets and to realize acceptable margins with the exception of the phoenix market 
the phoenix market has been  and continues to be  extremely competitive due to dealer pricing and the company continues to lose market share 
the company is actively marketing its remaining retail assets in the phoenix area 
the company s phoenix fuel operations continue to be affected by an economic downturn in its major markets 
this has resulted in reduced demand for finished products and lubricants  as well as having an affect on finished product margins 
in the fourth quarter of  volumes and margins improved over the three previous quarters 
the company expects this trend to continue into the first quarter of  but can provide no assurance that it will do so 
in order to maintain and improve its market position  phoenix fuel has implemented a number of operational and marketing strategies and is utilizing technological advances to attract and provide better service and information to its customers 
the company s future results of operations are primarily dependent on producing or purchasing  and selling  sufficient quantities of refined products at margins sufficient to cover fixed and variable expenses

these expenditures are primarily for operational and environmental projects at the company s existing refineries  including approximately  for a crude unit and coker unit turnaround at the yorktown refinery  and replacements and upgrades for the retail operations 
another  is budgeted for discretionary projects to sustain or enhance the current level of operations  increase earnings associated with existing or new business and to expand existing operations 
the remaining budget of  is for discretionary growth projects  including  for capital expenditure contingencies 
in future years  the company will be making substantial capital expenditures for certain government mandated environmental projects  including low sulfur fuel requirements 
see discussions under the caption regulatory  environmental and other matters included in items and for more details of these projects 
the company expects that maintenance capital expenditures will be approximately  and  annually over each of the next three years for its four corners refining operations and its retail group phoenix fuel operations  respectively  exclusive of any growth projects  acquisitions  and acquisition related capital expenditures

changes in the tax laws  changes in federal and state clean air and clean fuel requirements and other changes in environmental laws and regulations also may increase future capital and operating expenditure levels 
the company anticipates that working capital  including that necessary for capital expenditures and debt service  will be funded through existing cash balances  cash generated from operating activities  and  if necessary  future borrowings 
future liquidity  both short and long term  will continue to be primarily dependent on producing or purchasing  and selling  sufficient quantities of refined products at margins sufficient to cover fixed and variable expenses 
the company believes that it will have sufficient working capital to meet its needs over the next month period 
the company purchases crude oil and other feedstocks from a number of suppliers to operate its four corners and yorktown refineries 
the company acquires the feedstocks for its yorktown refinery from a number of domestic and international suppliers 
the company has not historically participated in these markets  and as such  has not had a credit relationship with these suppliers 
due to the weak economy and the poor profitability experienced by refiners and marketers  including the company  throughout  several suppliers to the yorktown refinery have required the company to provide letters of credit for either a portion or the full amount of the purchases 
at december  and february   the company had approximately  and  respectively  of letters of credit outstanding 
the company recently increased the availability of letters of credit under its credit facility from  to  the inability of the company to post satisfactory letters of credit could constrain the company s ability to purchase feedstocks on the most beneficial terms 
the company s cash flow from operations depends primarily on producing and selling quantities of refined products at refinery margins sufficient to cover fixed and variable expenses 
in recent years  crude oil costs and prices of refined products have fluctuated substantially 
these costs and prices depend on numerous factors beyond the company s control  including  among other things the supply of and demand for crude oil  gasoline and other refined products  changes in the economy  changes in the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products  worldwide political conditions  the marketing of alternative and competing fuels  the extent of government regulations  and local factors  including market conditions  pipeline capacity  and the level of operations of other refineries in the company s markets 
the company s crude oil requirements are supplied from sources that include major oil companies  large independent producers  and smaller local producers 
in general  crude oil supply contracts are relatively short term contracts with market responsive pricing provisions 
an increase in crude oil prices would adversely affect the company s operating margins if the company cannot pass along the increased cost of raw materials to customers 
the company s sale prices for refined products are influenced by the commodity price of crude oil 
generally  an increase or decrease in the price of crude oil results in a corresponding increase or decrease in the price of gasoline and other refined products 
the timing of the relative movement of the prices  however  as well as the overall change in product prices  could reduce profit margins and could have a significant impact on the company s refining and marketing operations  earnings  and cash flows 
in addition  the company maintains inventories of crude oil  intermediate products  and refined products  the values of which are subject to rapid fluctuation in market prices 
the company purchases its refinery feedstocks prior to selling the refined products manufactured from them 
price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the manufactured refined products could have a significant effect on the company s operating results 
any long term adverse relationships between costs and prices could impact the company s ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows to meet its working capital needs 
furthermore  because of the significantly greater volume of products produced and sold by the yorktown refinery  as compared to the company s other operations  the company has a much larger exposure to volatile refining margins than it had in the past 
moreover  the industry is highly competitive 
many of the company s competitors are large  integrated oil companies which  because of their more diverse operations  larger refineries  stronger capitalization and better brand name recognition  may be better able than the company is to withstand volatile industry conditions  including shortages or excesses of crude oil or refined products or intense price competition at the wholesale and retail levels 
because some of the company s competitors refineries are larger and more efficient than the company s refineries  these refineries may have lower per barrel crude oil refinery processing costs 
in addition  the company s ability to borrow funds under its current revolving credit facility could be adversely impacted by low product prices that could reduce the borrowing base tied to eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
the company s debt instruments also contain certain restrictive covenants that limit the company s ability to borrow funds if certain thresholds are not maintained 
at present  the company can only borrow additional amounts under its revolving credit facility as a result of the limitation on additional indebtedness contained in the indentures supporting the company s notes 
see the discussion below in capital structure for further information relating to these loan covenants 
the company presently has senior subordinated ratings of b from moody s investor services and b from standard poor s 
capital structure at december  and december   the company s long term debt was and of total capital  respectively  and the company s net debt long term debt less cash and cash equivalents to total capitalization percentages were and  respectively 
the increase in each percentage is primarily related to the increased debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the yorktown refinery 
at december  the company had long term debt of  net of current portion of  including   of senior subordinated notes due the notes and  of senior subordinated notes due the notes 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item for a description of these obligations 
repayment of the notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on an unconditional basis by the company s direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries  subject to a limitation designed to ensure that such guarantees do not constitute a fraudulent conveyance 
except as otherwise specified in the indentures pursuant to which the notes were issued  there are no restrictions on the ability of such subsidiaries to transfer funds to the company in the form of cash dividends  loans or advances 
general provisions of applicable state law  however  may limit the ability of any subsidiary to pay dividends or make distributions to the company in certain circumstances 
separate financial statements of the company s subsidiaries are not included herein because the aggregate assets  liabilities  earnings  and equity of the subsidiaries are substantially equivalent to the assets  liabilities  earnings  and equity of the company on a consolidated basis  the subsidiaries are jointly and severally liable for the repayment of the notes  and the separate financial statements and other disclosures concerning the subsidiaries are not deemed by the company to be material to investors 
as described in more detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item  the indentures supporting the company s notes and the company s credit facility and loan facility contain certain restrictive covenants  and other terms and conditions that if not maintained  if violated  or if certain conditions are met  could result in default  early redemption of the notes  and affect the company s ability to borrow funds  make certain payments  or engage in certain activities 
covenants associated with the notes and the notes currently restrict the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  other than under its credit facility  pay dividends  and purchase the company s common stock 
a default under any of the notes  the credit facility or the loan facility could cause such debt  and by reason of cross default provisions  the company s other debt to become immediately due and payable 
if the company is unable to repay such amounts  the lenders under the company s credit facility and loan facility could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that debt 
if those lenders accelerate the payment of the credit facility and loan facility  the company cannot provide assurance that its assets would be sufficient to pay that debt and other debt or that it would be able to refinance such debt or borrow more money on terms acceptable to it  if at all 
the company s ability to comply with the covenants  and other terms and conditions  of the indentures  the credit facility and the loan facility may be affected by many events beyond the company s control  and the company cannot provide assurance that its operating results will be sufficient to comply with the covenants  terms and conditions 
the company s high degree of leverage and these covenants may  among other things limit the company s ability to use cash flow  or obtain additional financing  for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  continue to restrict the company s ability to pay dividends if it so desired  require a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  limit the company s flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in business and industry conditions  place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors  and increase the company s vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions and  to the extent of the company s outstanding debt under senior credit facilities  the impact of increases in interest rates 
if the company is not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service its debt  or meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements  due to borrowing base restrictions  increased letter of credit requirements  or otherwise  it may be required to sell assets  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of its existing debt  or obtain additional financing 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to refinance its debt  sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to it  if at all 
in addition  the acquisition of the yorktown refinery could constrain the company s ability to borrow funds  make payments  or engage in other contemplated activities under the terms of the indentures supporting its notes  the credit facility  or the loan facility  particularly in the first three years of operations 
as described in more detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item  the company had loan covenant issues in the quarter ending september  amendments to the credit facility and the loan facility addressed these issues 
the company expects to be in compliance with the amended covenants going forward  and does not believe that any presently contemplated activities will be constrained 
a prolonged period of low refining margins  however  would have a negative impact on the company s ability to borrow funds and to make expenditures for certain purposes and would have an impact on compliance with the company s loan covenants 
included in the tables below are a list of the company s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts and under contingent commitments 
payments due all remaining contractual obligations total years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations excluding original issue discount 
amount of commitment expiration all remaining other commercial commitments total years in thousands lines of credit including standby letters of credit standby letters of credit standby letters of credit reduce the availability of funds for direct borrowings under the line of credit 
at december  there was  of direct borrowings under the line of credit 
the company is committed under a long term purchase contract that expires in august to purchase a minimum of  barrels per day of natural gasoline at market price plus an additional amount per gallon 
the company s board previously authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock  to be made from time to time as conditions permit 
shares could be repurchased through privately negotiated transactions  block share purchases and open market transactions 
the share repurchase program was discontinued in and no shares were repurchased in since the inception of the stock repurchase program  the company repurchased  shares for approximately  resulting in a weighted average cost of per share 
the repurchased shares are treated as treasury shares and are available for a number of corporate purposes including  among other things  for options  bonuses  and other employee stock benefit plans 
the board suspended the payment of cash dividends on common stock in the fourth quarter of at the present time  the company is unable to pay dividends under the terms of its indentures and has no plans to reinstate such dividends even if it could 
the payment of future dividends is subject to the results of the company s operations  declaration by the company s board of directors  and compliance with certain debt covenants

acridge  the company s former chairman  president and chief executive officer the former ceo 
certain of these transactions are summarized in the table below 
material related party transactions transaction purchase of jomax real property n a  n a purchase of jomax rights n a  n a purchase of artwork for corporate headquarters n a   purchase of stock n a   principal amount of loan receivable at the end of each year interest income on loan interest receivable at other receivables at other amounts classified as compensation n a  n a other receipts payments n a   for a discussion or the matters included in the above table  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item excluded from the above table are a number of immaterial transactions involving the company and the former ceo or entities controlled  or previously controlled  by the former ceo  including i amounts paid to the company for purchases of fuel  ii payments made to entities controlled  or previously controlled  by the former ceo for events held at facilities owned by such entities  iii reimbursements for certain landscaping and maintenance services provided for the former ceo and entities controlled  or previously controlled  by the former ceo  and iv the value of products and services provided to the company by the former ceo or entities controlled  or previously controlled  by him 
various immaterial amounts involving other related parties are also excluded from the table 
additionally  in  the company extended the period of time that the former ceo had to exercise  stock option grants for one year

it is unknown whether  and to what extent  creditors  including the company  will receive any recovery on their respective debts from any of the four bankruptcy estates 
risk management the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in certain commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these normal business exposures  the company  from time to time  uses commodity futures and options contracts to reduce price volatility  to fix margins in its refining and marketing operations and to protect against price declines associated with its crude oil and finished products inventories 
the company s policies for trading activities and the use of derivative financial instruments set limits on quantities  requires various levels of approval and requires certain review and reporting procedures 
in the second and third quarters of  the company entered into various crude oil futures contracts in order to economically hedge crude oil inventories and crude oil purchases for the yorktown refinery operations 
for the year ended december   the company recognized losses on these contracts of approximately  in cost of products sold 
these transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and accordingly were marked to market each month 
at december   the company had no open crude oil futures contracts or other commodity derivatives 
the company s credit facility is floating rate debt tied to various short term indices 
as a result  the company s annual interest costs associated with this debt may fluctuate 
at december   there were  of direct borrowings outstanding under this facility 
the potential increase in annual interest expense from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates on these borrowings at december   would be approximately  the company s loan facility is floating rate debt tied to various short term indices

at december   there was  outstanding under this facility 
the potential increase in annual interest expense from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates on these borrowings at december   would be approximately the company s operations are subject to normal hazards of operations  including fire  explosion and weather related perils 
the company maintains various insurance coverages  including business interruption insurance  subject to certain deductibles 
the company is not fully insured against certain risks because such risks are not fully insurable  coverage is unavailable or premium costs  in the judgment of the company  do not justify such expenditures 
credit risk with respect to customer receivables is concentrated in the geographic areas in which the company operates and relates primarily to customers in the oil and gas industry 
to minimize this risk  the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial position and requires collateral  such as letters of credit  in certain circumstances 
other federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment  health  and safety affect nearly all of the operations of the company 
as is the case with other companies engaged in similar industries  the company faces significant exposure from actual or potential claims and lawsuits brought by either governmental authorities or private parties  alleging non compliance with environmental  health  and safety laws or regulations  or property damage or personal injury caused by the environmental  health  or safety impacts of current or historic operations 
these matters include soil and water contamination  air pollution and personal injuries or property damage allegedly caused by substances manufactured  handled  used  released or disposed of by the company or by its predecessors 
applicable laws and regulations govern the investigation and remediation of contamination at the company s current and former properties  as well as at third party sites to which the company sent wastes for disposal 
the company may be held liable for contamination existing at current or former properties  notwithstanding that a prior operator of the site  or other third party  caused the contamination 
the company may also be held responsible for costs associated with contamination cleanup at third party disposal sites  notwithstanding that the original disposal activities were in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements at such time 
the company is currently engaged in a number of such remediation projects 
future expenditures related to compliance with environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations  the investigation and remediation of contamination  and the defense or settlement of governmental or private property claims and lawsuits cannot be reasonably quantified in many circumstances for various reasons 
these reasons include the speculative nature of remediation and cleanup cost estimates and methods  imprecise and conflicting data regarding the hazardous nature of various types of substances  the number of other potentially responsible parties involved  various defenses that may be available to the company and changing environmental  health  and safety laws  regulations and their respective interpretations 
the company cannot provide assurance that compliance with such laws or regulations  such investigations or cleanups  or such enforcement proceedings or private party claims will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operation 
for a further discussion of environmental  health  and safety matters affecting the company s operations  see the discussion of such matters contained in items and under the heading regulatory  environmental and other matters 
rules and regulations implementing federal  state and local laws relating to the environment  health  and safety will continue to affect the operations of the company 
the company cannot predict what new environmental  health  or safety legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or enforced with respect to products or activities to which they have not been previously applied 
compliance with more stringent laws or regulations  as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of the regulatory agencies  could have an adverse effect on the financial position and the results of operations of the company and could require substantial expenditures by the company for  among other things i the installation and operation of refinery equipment  pollution control systems and other equipment not currently possessed by the company  ii the acquisition or modification of permits applicable to company activities  and iii the initiation or modification of cleanup activities 
as of december  and  the company had environmental liability accruals of approximately  and  respectively  which are summarized in the table below 
environmental accruals are recorded in the current and long term sections of the company s consolidated balance sheets 
note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item contains a more detailed discussion of certain of these projects 
summary of environmental contingencies as of increase as of decrease payments in thousands farmington refinery ciniza land treatment facility bloomfield tank farm old terminal ciniza solid waste management units bloomfield refinery ciniza well closures retail service stations various yorktown refinery totals the company has a retirement plan  the giant yorktown cash balance plan the cash plan  and a retiree medical plan  the giant yorktown retiree medical plan the medical plan  for the employees of giant yorktown  inc these plans contain many of the same features of plans that were in place for the employees of bp 
as part of the acquisition  the company recorded a liability for future payments under these plans of approximately  for the cash plan and  for the medical plan 
the cash plan is a defined benefit plan 
the cash plan is a cash balance retirement plan fully funded by the company without employee contributions 
all employees of giant yorktown  inc meeting the eligibility requirements are automatically included in the cash plan 
yorktown employees who were covered by the bp retirement plan on july   are eligible for a grandfather provision that affects the calculation of the benefit under the plan 
employees who complete at least five years of vesting service  are at least years old  die while employed by giant yorktown  inc  or leave employment due to certain company actions are completely vested and eligible to receive the full value of their vested plan benefit 
the vested benefit will be paid at the employee s discretion when the employee leaves the company  regardless of age or service 
the company must make a lump sum payment to the cash plan each year 
the amount of the company s annual payment is based on various factors  including actuarial calculations linked to the potential retirement ages of yorktown employees 
the company s payment to the cash plan for the year ending december  will be  and will be made by august for the year ending december   the company estimates that the annual payment for the cash plan will be approximately  the medical plan is a defined post retirement benefit plan 
the medical plan will pay a percentage of the medical premium for coverage under the plan 
coverage is available to full time employees who are age or older with or more years of service 
the company will pay from to of the premium cost  depending on age and years of service 
unlike the cash plan  the company is not required to fund the medical plan on an annual basis 
the company did not make a payment to the medical plan for the year ending december  and does not anticipate making a payment to the medical plan for the year ending december  the company s ciniza and bloomfield refineries primarily process a mixture of high gravity  low sulfur crude oil  condensate and ngls 
the locally produced  high quality crude oil known as four corners sweet is the primary feedstock for these refineries 
the company s current projections of four corners crude oil production indicate that the company s crude oil demand will exceed the crude oil supply that is available from local sources for the foreseeable future 
the company expects to operate the ciniza and bloomfield refineries at lower levels than otherwise would be scheduled as a result of shortfalls in four corners crude oil production 
for a further discussion of raw material supply for the company s refineries  see the discussion contained in items and under the heading raw material supply 
the company is aware of a number of actions  proposals or industry discussions regarding product pipeline projects that could impact portions of its marketing areas 
the completion of some or all of these projects would result in increased competition by increasing the amount of refined products potentially available in these markets  as well as improving competitor access to these areas 
it also could result in new opportunities for the company  as the company is a net purchaser of refined products in some of these areas 
for a further discussion of the potential impact of pipeline projects on the company s four corners operations  as well as other competitive factors affecting these operations  see the discussion of competitive factors contained in items and under the heading competitive conditions 
the company s refining activities are conducted at its two refinery locations in new mexico and the yorktown refinery in virginia 
these refineries constitute a significant portion of the company s operating assets  and the two new mexico refineries supply a significant portion of the company s retail operations 
as a result  the company s operations would be subject to significant interruption if any of the refineries were to experience a major accident  be damaged by severe weather or other natural disaster  or otherwise be forced to shut down 
if any of the refineries were to experience an interruption in supply or operations  the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected
