f r s annual revenue  prior to the acquisition  was approximately million euro 
our december  consolidated balance sheet contains a purchase price allocation consistent with the guidelines in financial accounting standards board statement no 
 business combinations fas 
on july   we acquired adev electronic sa adev located in rosieres  france and its closely affiliated distributor  ek eminent ek eminent located in gothenburg  sweden for approximately million in cash less assumed net debt of million 
adev also has a low cost manufacturing facility located in tunisia 
adev manufactures and distributes electronic systems predominantly to the oem market 
their product lines include thermostats and controls for heating  ventilation and air conditioning  control systems for hydronic and electric floor warming systems  and controls for other residential applications 
eminent distributes electronic controls  mechanical thermostats and other electric control related products throughout the european nordic countries 
the two companies combined annual revenue preceding the acquisition was approximately million euro 
our december  consolidated balance sheet contains a purchase price allocation consistent with the guidelines in fas on may   we acquired hunter innovations of sacramento  california for million  of which approximately million was paid in cash at the closing and the balance in interest bearing notes  payable in equal installments over the next four years 
hunter innovations was founded in and has developed a line of large backflow prevention devices that represent a significant advance in technology 
the improved product features that are important to the backflow prevention markets include lighter weight  more compact design  better flow characteristics  improved serviceability and multiple end connection and shutoff valve options 
hunter innovations sales during the twelve months preceding the acquisition were approximately million 
unlike most of our acquisitions  hunter did not have significant historical revenues or earnings 
nonetheless  the purchase price was based on projected revenues and earnings as utilized in other acquisitions 
during the quarter ending september   we obtained a third party valuation to allocate the purchase price 
consistent with the guidelines in fas  the allocation for goodwill was approximately million and approximately million was for intangibles  which are classified in other assets other in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  of the million of acquired intangible assets  million was assigned to unpatented technology that is not currently subject to amortization and million to patents twenty year useful life 
the million of goodwill was assigned to the north american segment  none of which is deductible for tax purposes 
on march   we entered into a joint venture with the yuhuan county cheng guan metal hose factory cheng guan located in taizhou  zhejiang province of the people s republic of china 
cheng guan  with annual sales prior to the transaction of approximately million  is a manufacturer of a variety of plumbing products sold both into the chinese domestic market and export markets 
its product lines were contributed to the joint venture and include hose  hose connectors  multi layer tubing and stainless steel braided hose 
the joint venture is owned by us and by our chinese partner 
we will invest million to obtain this interest  million of which had been paid as of december  our december  consolidated balance sheet contains a purchase price allocation of the joint venture 
the allocation for goodwill was approximately million and approximately million was for other amortizable intangibles  which are classified in other assets other in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  as part of our million capital expenditure budget for fiscal  we expected to invest approximately million to establish a controlled bronze and brass manufacturing plant in tianjin  china 
we anticipate that the construction of the plant will be completed in early any remaining costs are expected to be disbursed over the next two quarters of fiscal as of december   we have spent approximately million 
we are in the process of implementing a plan to consolidate several of our manufacturing plants both in north america and europe 
at the same time we are expanding our manufacturing capacity in china and other low cost areas of the world 
the implementation of this manufacturing restructuring plan began during the fourth quarter of fiscal the projects for which charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal are essentially complete 
during  we decided to expand the scope of the manufacturing restructuring plan and transfer certain production to low cost manufacturing plants in tunisia and bulgaria 
the expanded plan is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal we anticipate that the pre tax cost of the manufacturing restructuring plan will be million 
we recorded pre tax manufacturing restructuring and other costs of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal and million for fiscal we anticipate recording additional pre tax costs of approximately million in fiscal as we continue to implement the program 
the manufacturing restructuring and other costs recorded in and consist primarily of severance costs  asset write downs and accelerated depreciation 
the severance costs  which have been recorded as restructuring  are for employees in manufacturing and administration groups  of whom have been terminated as of december  asset write downs consist primarily of write offs of inventory related to product lines that we have discontinued as part of this restructuring plan and they have been recorded in cost of goods sold 
accelerated depreciation is based on shorter remaining estimated useful lives of certain fixed assets and has been recorded in cost of goods sold 
other costs consist primarily of removal and shipping costs associated with relocation of manufacturing equipment and has been recorded in cost of goods sold 
the tax benefits of costs incurred and asset write downs will approximate the amount of cash outlays to implement this program  which would allow us to complete the restructuring plan with a minimum consumption of cash 
following the completion of the plan  we estimate an annual pre tax savings of approximately million at current production volume 
our annual report to shareholders discusses earnings as adjusted to exclude manufacturing restructuring and other costs and goodwill amortization for fiscal and management believes this information to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the operating performance of our company because it helps investors understand the impact of changes in accounting principles and the impact of our restructuring plan 
it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
a reconciliation of adjusted earnings to earnings as reported for the twelve months ended december   and is provided below 
adjusted earnings exclude restructuring  impairment and related costs for the twelve months ended december  and and also excludes goodwill amortization  based on the adoption of fas  for the twelve months ended december  and twelve months ended twelve months ended twelve months ended in thousands earnings as reported continuing operations    cost of restructuring   goodwill amortization   adjusted earnings continuing operations    the components of restructuring and other costs are outlined below

net sales for the twelve months ended december  increased  to  compared to  for the same period in the increase in net sales is attributable to the following in thousands internal growth  acquisitions  foreign exchange  total change  the increase in net sales from internal growth is primarily attributable to increased unit sales in the do it yourself diy market in north america 
the growth in net sales from acquired businesses is due to the inclusion of the net sales from powers process controls of skokie  illinois  acquired on september   premier manufactured systems of phoenix  arizona  acquired on june   fimet of milan  italy  acquired on june   cheng guan  our joint venture  which we established on march   adev and eminent  acquired on july   and f r acquired on july  the increase in foreign exchange is due primarily to the euro appreciating against the us dollar compared to the same period in we monitor our net sales in three geographical segments north america  europe and asia

the increase in net sales in europe is due to the inclusion of fimet  adev  eminent and f r and the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar 
the increase in net sales in asia is primarily due to the inclusion of our chen guan joint venture 
gross profit 
gross profit for the twelve months ended december  increased  from the comparable prior year period and increased as a percentage of net sales to from 
we charged  and  of costs associated with our manufacturing restructuring plan to cost of sales in and  respectively 
excluding the cost associated with the manufacturing restructuring plan in and  gross profit would have increased  and would have increased as a percentage of net sales to from 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to  from  for the comparable prior year period 
this increase is attributable to the inclusion of the selling  general and administrative expenses of acquired companies  an increase in the cost of product and general liability insurance and administrative start up costs associated with our new manufacturing plant in china 
we adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
goodwill and other intangibles fas on january   and accordingly did not record any goodwill amortization for fiscal we recorded goodwill amortization of  as part of our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges for the twelve months ended december  decreased  to  compared to  for the same period in these costs are primarily for severance costs 
the costs related to the twelve months ended december  were for employees  of which have been terminated as of december   compared to the costs related to december  which were for employees  all of which have been terminated as of december  operating income 
operating income for the twelve months ended december  increased  to  compared to  for the same period in due to increased gross profit and the cessation of goodwill amortization  partially offset by increased other selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income by segment for the twelve months ended december  and was as follows twelve months ended twelve months ended change in thousands north america    europe    asia   corporate    total    the increase in north america is due to increased gross profit  primarily due to the inclusion of operating results of acquired companies partially offset by increased premiums for product and general liability insurance 
the increase in europe is due to the inclusion of the operating results of acquired companies and the euro appreciating against the us dollar compared to the prior year 
the decrease in china is primarily due to increased bad debt and warranty expense 
corporate expenses are primarily for compensation expense  professional fees  including legal and audit expenses and product liability and general liability insurances 
the increase in corporate expenses is primarily due to increased legal and audit expenses and administrative start up costs associated with our new manufacturing plant in china 
interest expense 
interest expense for the twelve months ended december  decreased  to  compared to  for the same period in  primarily due to lower interest rates on variable rate indebtedness and capitalized construction period interest on our startup manufacturing plant in china  partially offset by the increased levels of debt incurred to fund acquisitions 
on september   we entered into an interest rate swap with respect to our  notes due december the swap converted the interest from fixed to floating 
on august   we sold the swap and received  in cash 
interest expense for the twelve months ended december  has been reduced by  from the benefit of the swap while active and by the amortization of the adjustment to the fair value subsequent to the sale of the swap 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate for continuing operations for the twelve months ended december   increased to from for the comparable prior year period 
the increase is primarily due to a change in our earnings mix to jurisdictions with higher tax rates 
also in  the costs for the manufacturing restructuring plan were recorded in tax jurisdictions with tax rates higher than our effective rate  which caused the overall effective rate for to be lower than would normally be expected 
excluding the impact of the after tax manufacturing costs and goodwill amortization in both and  the effective tax rate would have increased to from 
net income from continuing operations 
net income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended december  increased  to  or per common share compared to  or per common share  for the twelve months ended december  on a diluted basis 
twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  net sales 
net sales for the twelve months ended december  increased  to  compared to  for the same period in the increase in net sales is attributable to the following in thousands internal growth  acquisitions  foreign exchange  total change  the decrease in net sales from internal growth is attributable to decreased unit sales to north american and european plumbing and heating wholesalers resulting from the continued weakness in the north american plumbing market and the weakened european economy 
these decreases were partially offset by increased unit sales in the diy market 
the growth in net sales from acquired businesses is due to the inclusion of the net sales from powers process controls of skokie  illinois  acquired on september   premier manufactured systems of phoenix  arizona  acquired on june   fimet of milan  italy  acquired on june   dumser metallbau gmbh co  kg of landau  germany  acquired on january   the business acquired from chiles power supply and bask  llc of springfield  missouri  now doing business as watts radiant  acquired on august   and mccraney  inc of santa ana  california  doing business as spacemaker  acquired on may  the decrease in foreign exchange is due primarily to the devaluation of the euro against the us dollar compared to the same period in we monitor our net sales in three geographical segments north america  europe and asia 
as outlined below  north america  europe and asia accounted for  and of net sales  respectively  in the twelve months ended december  compared to   and  respectively  in the twelve months ended december  our net sales in each of these geographic segments for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows twelve months ended twelve months ended change in thousands north america    europe    asia   total    the increase in net sales in north america is due to the inclusion of powers process controls  premier manufactured systems  watts radiant  and spacemaker acquisitions  as well as increased unit sales to the diy market  partially offset by decreased unit sales to plumbing and heating wholesalers 
the increase in net sales in europe is due to the inclusion of fimet and dumser  partially offset by decreased unit sales to european plumbing and heating wholesalers and the euro s devaluation against the us dollar 
gross profit 
gross profit for the twelve months ended december  decreased  from the comparable prior year period and decreased as a percentage of net sales to from 
we charged  of costs associated with our manufacturing restructuring plan to cost of sales 
excluding these manufacturing restructuring costs  the gross profit would have increased  and declined as a percentage of sales to from 
this decreased percentage is primarily attributable to an unfavorable sales mix caused by the decreased sales to plumbing and heating wholesalers as well as the inclusion of the gross margin of acquired companies  which operated at a lower gross margin than the remainder of our business 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to  from  for the comparable prior year period 
this increase is attributable to the inclusion of the selling  general and administrative expenses of acquired companies  partially offset by the lower exchange rate of the euro relative to the us dollar and reduced spending levels 
restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges are primarily severance and related costs in the current year for employees  of which were terminated as of december  operating income 
operating income for the twelve months ended december  decreased  to  compared to the same period in due to reduced gross profit and manufacturing restructuring costs 
operating income by segment for the twelve months ended december  and was as follows twelve months ended twelve months ended change in thousands north america    europe    asia  corporate   total    the decrease in both north american and european operating income is due to decreased unit sales to plumbing and heating wholesalers and manufacturing restructuring plan costs 
these decreases were partially offset by the operating earnings of acquired companies 
the increase in china is primarily due to decreased bad debt expense due to the stabilization of the accounts receivable aging in the domestic chinese market 
corporate expenses are primarily for compensation expense  professional fees  including legal and audit expenses  product liability and general liability insurances 
interest expense 
interest expense for the twelve months ended december  decreased  to  compared to  for the same period in  primarily due to lower interest rates on variable rate indebtedness  partially offset by the increased levels of debt incurred for acquisitions 
on september   we entered into an interest rate swap with respect to our  notes due december the swap converted the interest from fixed to floating and reduced our interest expense by  during income taxes 
our effective tax rate for continuing operations decreased to from for the comparable prior year period 
the decrease is primarily due to statutory rate reductions affecting income tax in canada and other tax planning opportunities 
the costs for the manufacturing restructuring plan were recorded in tax jurisdictions with tax rates higher than the our effective rate  which lowered the overall effective rate for fiscal net income from continuing operations 
net income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended december  decreased  to  or per common share  compared to  or per common share for the twelve months ended december  on a diluted basis 
on a net of tax basis  the manufacturing restructuring plan costs accounted for per share of this reduction 
discontinued operations 
for the twelve months ended december   discontinued operations reported a net loss of  or per share  on a diluted basis 
we did not record any costs associated with discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  or see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources during the twelve month period ended december   we generated  of cash from continuing operations 
we spent  on capital equipment for the twelve months ended december   net of proceeds of  primarily from the sale of two facilities that were closed as part of our manufacturing restructuring plan 
the largest component of our capital expenditures was the establishment of a controlled bronze and brass manufacturing plant in tianjin  china  with an estimated total cost of  of which approximately  was invested in the twelve months ended december  the remaining capital expenditures were primarily for manufacturing machinery and equipment as part of our commitment to continuously improve our manufacturing capabilities 
in addition  during the twelve months ended december   we invested approximately  to establish our joint venture in china   to acquire hunter innovations  and approximately  for our three acquisitions in europe  adev  eminent and f r 
we had positive free cash flow of  defined as net cash provided by continuing operations minus capital expenditures and dividends plus proceeds from sale of assets during the twelve months ended december  versus positive free cash flow of  in the comparable prior year period 
we experienced an increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales volume  a change in industry wide payment terms from the home depot  inc  our largest customer  while remaining within normal industry standards  and the addition of accounts receivable from our cheng guan joint venture established in march this is offset by increased income from continuing operations and increased depreciation expense compared to the comparable period 
we believe free cash flow to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the operating performance of our company because it provides investors with a measure of our ability to repay debt and to fund acquisitions 
our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define free cash flow differently 
free cash flow does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our performance 
free cash flow should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities as defined by gaap 
a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by continuing operations is provided below twelve months ended twelve months ended in thousands net cash provided by continuing operations   less additions to property  plant  and equipment   plus proceeds from the sale of property  plant  and equipment  less dividends   free cash flow   on september   we received  of cash from zurich american insurance company for reimbursement of defense costs incurred by us in the james jones case since april  this cash  net of tax  is classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in addition on january   we received  of cash from zurich american insurance company for indemnification costs incurred in the james jones case 
see part i  item  product liability environmental and other litigation matters james jones case 
on february   we entered into a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks the revolving credit facility  which replaced our million us facility and our million euro facility 
the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million us  which includes a million tranche for us dollar borrowings and a million tranche for euro based borrowings and matures in february approximately million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to repay amounts outstanding under the prior facilities 
the revolving credit facility is being used to support our acquisition program  working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   long term debt included million outstanding on the revolving credit facility for both us dollar and euro based borrowings 
outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility bears interest at one of three customary rates plus a margin of basis points  depending on the applicable base rate and our bond rating 
the average interest rate for borrowings under the revolving credit facility was approximately at december  the revolving credit facility includes operational and financial covenants customary for facilities of this type  including  among others  restrictions on additional indebtedness  liens and investments and maintenance of certain leverage ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants related to the revolving credit facility 
working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities as of december  was million compared to million as of december  this decrease is primarily due to the classification of our million notes due december as current portion of long term debt partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
excluding the million notes  the working capital would have been million 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to as of december  compared to to as of december  cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  compared to million as of december  proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million for december   primarily due to the exercising of expiring options 
the increase in total debt to million as of december  from million as of december  was due to the funding of acquisitions  the increase in working capital exclusive of the current portion of long term debt impact and debt incurred to fund capital expenditures 
net debt to capitalization defined as short and long term interest bearing liabilities less cash and cash equivalents as a percentage of the sum of short and long term interest bearing liabilities less cash and cash equivalents plus total stockholders equity  including minority interest was as of december  compared to as of december  our net debt to capitalization is not computed in accordance with gaap 
management believes it to be an appropriate supplemental measure because it helps investors understand our ability to meet our financing needs 
our computation may not be comparable to other companies that may define debt to capitalization differently 
a reconciliation of net debt is provided below twelve months ended twelve months ended in thousands current portion of long term debt   plus long term debt  net of current portion   less cash and cash equivalents   net debt   a reconciliation of capitalization is provided below twelve months ended twelve months ended in thousands total stockholders equity   plus minority interest   capitalization   our net capital expenditure budget for fiscal is  which includes expected proceeds from the sale of a facility that was closed as part of our manufacturing restructuring plan 
in january  we contributed  to our pension plan and expect to contribute approximately  within the first six months of fiscal to fund the minimum contribution required 
we also intend to refinance our million notes prior to the stated maturity of december  we anticipate that available funds from current operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet current operating requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may have to consider external sources of financing for any large future acquisitions 
our long term financial obligations are presented in the following table total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt  including current maturities a   operating leases      capital leases  total      a as recognized in the consolidated balance sheet letters of credit are purchased guarantees that ensure our performance or payment to third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
amounts outstanding were approximately  as of december  and  as of december  these instruments may exist or expire without being drawn down 
therefore  they do not necessarily represent future cash flow obligations 
certain of our loan agreements contain covenants that require  among other items  the maintenance of certain financial ratios and limit our ability to enter into secured borrowing arrangements 
we from time to time are involved with environmental proceedings and other legal proceedings and incur costs on an ongoing basis related to these matters 
we have not incurred material costs in fiscal in connection with any of these matters 
during the twelve months ended december   we disbursed approximately million after tax of defense and settlement costs related to the james jones case 
in september  we received million after tax for reimbursement of defense costs related to the james jones case 
these amounts are recorded as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
in addition  on january   we received million after tax for indemnification incurred in the james jones case 
see part i  item  business product liability  environmental and other litigation matters james jones litigation 
critical accounting policies and key estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
a critical accounting estimate is an assumption about highly uncertain matters and could have a material effect on the financial statements if another  also reasonable  amount were used  or  a change in the estimate is reasonably likely from period to period 
we base our assumption on historical experience and on other estimates that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies utilized in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the estimates with our audit committee 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our most significant estimates and assumptions allowance for doubtful accounts we encounter risks associated with the collectibility of customer accounts 
management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable  historical bad debts and allowances  concentration of receivables by customer  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
these factors along with the aging of the accounts receivable are used in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
if circumstances relating to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market with costs determined on a first in  first out basis 
we utilize our historical experience as the basis for determining the value of our excess or obsolete inventories 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand or changes in technology or features could result in additional obsolete inventory that is not saleable and could require additional inventory reserve provisions 
legal contingencies we are a defendant in numerous legal matters including those involving environmental law and product liability as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as required by financial accounting standards board statement no 
accounting for contingencies we determine whether an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated  net of any applicable insurance proceeds 
we develop our estimates in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters  which involves an analysis of potential results 
final settlement of these matters could result in significant effects on the results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
goodwill and other intangibles we adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas on january   and as a result we no longer amortize goodwill 
the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets is reviewed for impairment annually in accordance with fas intangible assets such as purchased technology are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
in our larger  more complex acquisitions  the value assigned to intangible assets is determined by an independent valuation firm based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations of the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the assets to their realizable value 
the annual goodwill impairment test involves the use of estimates related to the fair market value of the business unit with which the goodwill is associated 
the value is estimated using the future cash flow valuation methodology 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge to goodwill which could have a material impact on the results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
business combinations in addition to the requirements set forth in fas regarding intangible assets  it is necessary to make other estimates relating to the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and assumptions of future growth of the acquired companies 
there are no assurances that such estimates or assumptions will be accurate 
pension benefits the calculation of employee pension benefit costs and obligations by actuaries are dependent on our assumptions 
these assumptions include salary growth  long term return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
the key factors utilized by the actuaries are discussed in further detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future consequences of events that have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
we present our financials in accordance with the rules of financial accounting standards board statement no 
accounting for income taxes fas 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on differences between the book values and tax bases of particular assets and liabilities  using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
certain factors affecting future results this annual report on form k contains statements which are not historical facts and are considered forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements contain projections of our future results of operations  our financial position or state other forward looking information 
in some cases you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will and would or similar words 
you should not rely on forward looking statements  because they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that might cause these differences are as follows we face intense competition and  if we are not able to respond to competition in our markets  our revenues may decrease competitive pressures in our markets could adversely affect our competitive position  leading to a possible loss of market share or a decrease in prices  either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits 
we encounter intense competition in all areas of our business 
additionally  customers for our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce the size and diversity of their inventories and their transaction costs 
to remain competitive  we will need to invest continuously in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments and we may be unable to maintain our competitive position 
in addition  we anticipate that we may have to reduce the prices of some of our products to stay competitive  potentially resulting in a reduction in the profit margin for  and inventory valuation of  these products 
some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices in foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our us dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products which are priced in other currencies 
implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful  which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or our profitability our growth through the last two years has been largely driven by acquisitions 
one of our strategies is to increase our revenues and profitability and expand our markets through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary water related products 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
also  companies acquired recently and in the future may not achieve revenues  profitability or cash flows that justify our investment in them 
we expect to spend significant time and effort in expanding our existing businesses and identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may result in higher acquisition prices  possibly leading to a decrease in our revenues and profitability 
in addition  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including  but not limited to adverse short term effects on our reported operating results  diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel at acquired companies  and unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities 
down economic cycles  particularly reduced levels of housing starts and remodeling  have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles 
the businesses of most of our customers  particularly plumbing and heating wholesalers and home improvement retailers  are cyclical 
therefore  the level of our business activity has been cyclical  fluctuating with economic cycles 
we also believe our level of business activity is influenced by housing starts and renovation and remodeling  which are  in turn  heavily influenced by mortgage interest rates  consumer debt levels  changes in disposable income  employment growth and consumer confidence 
if these and other factors cause a material reduction in housing and remodeling starts  our revenues and profits would decrease and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business and future operating results since we sell and manufacture our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our business and future operating results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  which could increase our costs of doing business internationally  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  which could have an adverse impact on our profits  hiring and retaining senior management in overseas operations  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  which could reduce our productivity  costs of compliance with differing labor regulations  especially in connection with restructuring our overseas operations  laws of some foreign countries  which may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  which may be costly and require significant time to implement  and political risks specific to foreign jurisdictions 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could materially affect our reported results we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies  as a significant portion of our sales and certain portions of our costs  assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
approximately of our sales during were from sales outside of the us for the twelve months ended december   the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar had a positive impact on sales of  for the twelve months ended december   the depreciation of the euro against the us dollar had an adverse impact on sales of  if our share of revenue in non dollar denominated currencies continues to increase in future periods  exchange rate fluctuations will likely have a greater impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
there are significant risks in expanding our manufacturing operations in china as part of our strategy  we are shifting a significant portion of our manufacturing operations to china to reduce our production costs 
this will subject a greater portion of our operations to the risks of doing business in china 
the chinese legal system is relatively new and lacks transparency  which gives the chinese central and local government authorities a higher degree of control over our business in china than is customary in developed economies and makes the process of obtaining necessary regulatory approval in china inherently unpredictable 
in addition  the protection accorded our proprietary technology and know how under the chinese legal system is not as strong as in the united states and  as a result  we may lose valuable trade secrets and competitive advantage 
although the chinese government has been pursuing economic reform and a policy of welcoming foreign investments for the past two decades  there can be no assurance that the chinese government will not change its current policies in the future  making continued business operations in china difficult or unprofitable 
reductions or interruptions in the supply of raw materials and increases in the prices of raw materials could reduce our profit margins and adversely impact our ability to meet our customer delivery commitments we require substantial amounts of raw materials  including bronze  brass and cast iron and substantially all raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources 
the availability and prices of raw materials may be subject to curtailment or change due to  among other things  new laws or regulations  suppliers allocations to other purchasers  interruptions in production by suppliers  changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels 
we are not currently party to any long term supply agreements 
our inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for our products at favorable prices  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations by decreasing our profit margins and by hindering our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
for example  in november one of a limited number of brass rod suppliers went on strike and simultaneously copper based metals prices increased dramatically 
the combination of these events caused an increase in our operating costs and adversely affected our financial results 
to the extent we are not successful in implementing our manufacturing restructuring plan  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected our manufacturing restructuring plan  which we began in and we expanded in  was implemented to reduce our manufacturing cost 
if our planned manufacturing plant consolidations in the united states and europe and our production capability expansion in china are not successful  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we cannot continue operating our manufacturing facilities at current or higher utilization levels  our results of operations could be adversely affected the equipment and management systems necessary for the operation of our manufacturing facilities may break down  perform poorly or fail  resulting in fluctuations in our ability to manufacture our products and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies 
we operate a number of manufacturing facilities  all of which are subject to this risk  and such fluctuations at any of these facilities could cause an increase in our production costs and a corresponding decrease in our profitability 
for example  in one of our manufacturing facilities was shut down for a period of time as a result of a fire and we were required to source products from external vendors at substantially higher costs 
we also have a vertically integrated manufacturing process 
each segment is dependent upon the prior process and any breakdown in one segment will adversely affect all later components 
fluctuations in our production process may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
our inability to meet our delivery obligations could result in a loss of our customers and negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve or maintain market acceptance  our revenues and our profitability may decrease failure to develop new and innovative products or to custom design existing products could result in the loss of existing customers to competitors or the inability to attract new business  either of which may adversely affect our revenues 
our industry is characterized by intense competition  changes in specifications required by our customers and or plumbing codes  technically complex products  and constant improvement to existing products and introductions of new products 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer  on a timely basis  products that meet customer demands 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing or other difficulties  such as an inability to attract a sufficient number of experienced engineers  that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products or enhancements and result in unexpected expenses 
such difficulties could cause us to lose business from our customers and could adversely affect our competitive position  in addition  added expenses could decrease the profitability associated with those products that do not gain market acceptance 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses or reduce our profitability our operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  including laws and regulations governing air emissions  water discharges  waste management and disposal and workplace safety 
such laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations and require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases 
we also could be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
we could also be liable for the costs of property damage or personal injury to others 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial 
under certain environmental laws  the current and past owners or operators of real property may be liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination  even if they did not know of or were not responsible for such contamination 
these laws also impose liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous waste at any site 
therefore  our ownership and operation of real property and our disposal of waste could lead to liabilities under these laws 
we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  costs relating to these environmental matters 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur additional costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be significant 
environmental litigation  enforcement and compliance are inherently uncertain and we may experience significant costs in connection with environmental matters 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
we have been limited from time to time from selling products because of existing patents 
we face risks from product liability and other lawsuits  which may adversely affect our business we may be subjected to various product liability claims or other lawsuits  including  among others that our products include inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation  or inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products 
in the event that we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification  damages from these claims would have to be paid from our assets and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
in particular  if we settle or conclude litigation in a quarterly or annual reporting period  there could be a material impact on our operating results for that quarter or year 
we  like other manufacturers and distributors of products designed to control and regulate fluids  face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims and other lawsuits in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury  property damage or business interruption to our customers 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect 
in addition  in certain cases  we rely on third party manufacturers for our products or components of our products 
although we have product liability and general insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost  or  if available  will be adequate to cover any such liabilities 
see part i  item  product liability  environmental and other litigation matters the requirements of fas may result in a write off of all or a portion of our goodwill  which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition if we are required to take an impairment charge to our goodwill in connection with the requirements of fas our operating results may decrease and our financial condition may be harmed 
as of december   we had goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  of million  or of our total assets and of our total stockholders equity 
under fas  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill and are required to perform annual impairment reviews thereafter 
we have concluded that no impairment existed at january   the time of adoption of fas and at october   the time of our annual review 
as required by fas  we will perform annual tests in october of each year for indications of goodwill impairment 
the loss of a major customer could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for the twelve months ended december   our largest customer  the home depot  inc  accounted for approximately million  or  of our total net sales 
our second largest customer represented approximately of our total net sales in our top ten customers accounted for approximately of our total net sales in our customers generally are not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of products from us and are able to terminate their relationships with us at any time 
a significant reduction in orders or change in terms from the home depot  inc could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations

horne  a member of our board of directors  beneficially owned of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and of our outstanding shares of class b common stock  which represents of the total outstanding voting power 
as long as mr

shares of our class a common stock eligible for public sale could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock as of march  there were  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our class b common stock outstanding 
all of the shares of class a common stock are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the federal securities laws  except for any shares held by our affiliates  sales of which will be limited by rule under the securities act of in addition  under the terms of a registration rights agreement with respect to outstanding shares of our class b common stock  shares  the holders of our class b common stock have rights with respect to the registration of the underlying class a common shares under the securities act of under these registration rights  these class b common stockholders may require on two occasions that we register their shares for public resale

if we elect to register any of our shares of common stock for any public offering  these class b common stockholders are entitled to include shares of common stock in the registration 
however  we may reduce the number of shares proposed to be registered in view of market conditions 
we will pay all expenses in connection with any registration  other than underwriting discounts and commissions 
pursuant to the exercise of these registration rights  we have registered the resale of  shares of our class a common stock underlying class b common stock on a form s shelf registration statement 
if mr 
horne were to sell all of the registered shares into the public market  or sell other shares owned by him  the trading price of our class a common stock could decline 
our class a common stock has insignificant voting power our class b common stock entitles its holders to ten votes for each share 
class b common stock constitutes of our total outstanding common stock and of the total outstanding voting power and thus is able to exercise a controlling influence over our business 
the class a common stock entitles its holders to one vote per share 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of our class a common stock our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include those that authorize the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series without a stockholder vote  limit stockholders ability to call special meetings  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
restrictions in our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt and make acquisitions and other investments our revolving credit facility contains operational and financial covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders  incur additional debt and make acquisitions and other investments unless we satisfy certain financial tests and comply with various financial ratios 
if we do not maintain compliance with these covenants  our creditors could declare a default under our revolving credit facility and our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable

new accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas which requires companies to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
the company must also record a corresponding increase in the carrying value of the related long lived asset and depreciate that cost over the remaining useful life of the asset 
the liability must be increased each period for the passage of time with the offset recorded as an operating expense 
the liability must also be adjusted for changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
companies must also recognize a gain or loss on the settlement of the liability

the principal difference between this statement and issue relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity

under issue  a liability for an exit cost as defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and prices of certain raw materials used in the manufacturing process 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging underlying economic exposure 
the derivatives we use are instruments with liquid markets 
our consolidated earnings  which are reported in united states dollars are subject to translation risks due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk is concentrated in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro  the us dollar and the canadian dollar  and the us dollar and the chinese rmb 
our foreign subsidiaries transact most business  including certain intercompany transactions  in foreign currencies 
such transactions are principally purchases or sales of materials and are denominated in european currencies or the us or canadian dollar 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage the risk related to intercompany purchases that occur during the course of a fiscal year and certain open foreign currency denominated commitments to sell products to third parties 
at december   we had no forward contracts to buy foreign currencies and no unrealized gains or losses 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have historically had a very low exposure to changes in interest rates 
interest rate swaps are used to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate debt instruments and reduce interest expense on certain fixed rate instruments 
information about our long term debt including principal amounts and related interest rates appears in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
we purchase significant amounts of bronze ingot  brass rod and cast iron  which are utilized in manufacturing our many product lines 
our operating results can be adversely affected by changes in commodity prices if we are unable to pass on related price increases to our customers 
we manage this risk by monitoring related market prices  working with our suppliers to achieve the maximum level of stability in their costs and related pricing  seeking alternative supply sources when necessary and passing increases in commodity costs to our customers  to the maximum extent possible  when they occur 
additionally  on a limited basis  we use commodity futures contracts to manage this risk  but we did not in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements
