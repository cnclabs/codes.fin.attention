item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in note  industry segment information  to the consolidated financial statements 
within the donnelley print solutions segment  our business is concentrated geographically in the us  where we have operating facilities as of december  that generated billion in net sales in within the logistics services segment  we have operating facilities within the us as of december  that generated million in net sales in within the other segment  financial services has six operating facilities as of december  that generated million in net sales in rrd direct  also in the other segment  has five operating facilities as of december  that generated million in net sales in in addition to our us facilities  we operate plants in latin america  europe and china 
information relating to our international operations is included in note  geographic area information  to the consolidated financial statements 
commercial printing remains a competitive industry 
consolidation among our customers and in the printing industry  as well as over capacity in the industry as a whole  has put pressure on prices and increased competition among printers 
our logistics businesses  which leverage the usps delivery system  face competition generally from smaller  regional carriers 
we will compete by leveraging our position and size  generating continued productivity improvements and enhancing the value we deliver to our customers by offering them products and services that improve their effectiveness and reduce their total delivered cost 
while we have contracts with many of our print customers as discussed below  there are many competing companies and renewal of these contracts is dependent  in part  on our ability to continue to differentiate ourself from the competition 
while our manufacturing and distribution facilities are well located for the global  national or regional distribution of our products  competitors in some areas of the us may have a competitive advantage in some instances due to such factors as freight rates  wage scales and customer preference for local services 
in addition to location  other important competitive factors are price and quality  as well as the range of available services 

table of contents demand in several of the end markets served by our print and logistics businesses is affected by advertising and consumer spending trends 
historically  our businesses which serve the magazines  catalogs and retail and book publishing services end markets generate higher revenues in the second half of the year  driven by increased advertising pages within magazines  and holiday catalog  retail and book volumes 
these same factors drive higher revenues in the second half of the year for both our print and package logistics businesses 
approximately of our total company sales are under contracts with customers  with the remainder on a single order basis 
for some customers  we print and provide related services for different publications under different contracts 
contracts with our larger customers normally run for a period of years usually three to five years  but longer in the case of contracts requiring significant capital investment or for an indefinite period subject to termination on specified notice by either party 
these sales contracts generally provide for price adjustments to reflect price changes for materials  wages and utilities 
no single customer had a relationship with the company that accounted for or more of our sales in the primary raw materials we use in our print businesses are paper and ink 
in  we spent approximately billion on raw materials 
we are a large purchaser of paper and our focus is to improve materials performance and total cost management for our customers  which we believe is a competitive advantage 
we negotiate with leading suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies  but we do not rely on any one supplier 
we have existing paper supply contracts at prevailing market prices to cover substantially all of our requirements through  and management believes extensions and renewals of these purchase contracts will provide adequate paper supplies in the future 
ink and related materials are currently available in sufficient amounts  and we believe that we will have adequate supplies in the future 
we also coordinate purchasing activity at the local facility and corporate levels to increase economies of scale 
our overriding objectives in the environmental  health and safety arenas are to create sustainable compliance and an injury free workplace 
we believe that estimated capital expenditures for environmental controls to comply with federal  state and local provisions  as well as expenditures  if any  for our share of costs to clean hazardous waste sites that have received our waste  will not have a material effect on our results of operations or our competitive position 
as of december   we had approximately  employees 
approximately  employees in our us workforce have been our employees for to years  and more than  have been our employees for years or longer 
as of december   we employed approximately  people in the united states  approximately  or  of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
in addition  we employed approximately  people in our international operations  approximately  or  of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we did not make any business acquisitions during or during  we made several business acquisitions to extend our geographic reach and expand our range of capabilities 
within the donnelley print solutions segment  in january  we acquired omega studios southwest  inc  a photography studio offering digital photography and creative services 
in february  we acquired iridio  inc  a seattle based full services premedia technologies company 
both of these acquisitions are included within our premedia technologies operations

during  we also closed several start up operations  including red rover digital  that were included in the other operating segment

item legal proceedings on november   a class action was brought against the company in federal district court in chicago  illinois  on behalf of current and former african american employees  alleging that the company racially discriminated against them in violation of section of the civil rights act of  as amended  and the us constitution jones  et al 
v 
us donnelley sons co the complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief  and asks for actual  compensatory  consequential and punitive damages in an amount not less than million 

table of contents although plaintiffs sought nationwide class certification  most of the specific factual assertions of the complaint relate to the closing by the company of its chicago catalog operations in other general claims brought by certain named individuals relate to other company locations 
on june   a class action was filed against the company in federal district court in chicago on behalf of current and former african american employees  alleging that the company racially discriminated against them in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of adams  et al 
v 
rr donnelley sons rr while making many of the same general discrimination claims contained in the jones complaint  the adams plaintiffs also claim retaliation by the company for the filing of discrimination charges or otherwise complaining of race discrimination 
on april   in an amended opinion  the district court judge in the jones and adams cases certified three plaintiff classes in the actions a class consisting of african american employees discharged in connection with the shutdown of the chicago catalog operations  a class consisting of african american employees of the chicago catalog operations after november who were other than permanent employees  and a class consisting of african americans subjected to an allegedly hostile working environment at the chicago catalog operations  the chicago financial  pontiac or dwight  illinois  manufacturing operations 
the judge also consolidated the jones and adams cases for pretrial purposes 
in a decision issued september   the seventh circuit court of appeals overturned a ruling by the trial court and held that a two year statute of limitations applies to the claims filed under section of the civil rights act 
the court of appeals remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion  and on november   the court of appeals denied plaintiffs petition for rehearing 
absent the trial court s adoption of plaintiffs theories tolling the statute of limitations  the ruling of the court of appeals  unless reversed on appeal  will bar the claims of the classes in the jones case 
on december   a class action was filed against the company in federal district court in chicago alleging that older workers were discriminated against in selection for termination upon the closing of the chicago catalog operations gerlib  et al 
v 
rr donnelley sons rr the suit also alleged that the company violated the employee retirement income security act erisa in determining benefits payable under its retirement benefit and separation pay plans to retiring or terminated employees 
the complaint sought recalculation of pension benefits and separation pay due plaintiffs since their termination dates  as well as actual damages for  and reinstatement to correct  the alleged discrimination 
on august   the court certified classes in both the age discrimination and erisa claims limited to certain former employees of the chicago catalog operations 
on december   a purported class action was brought against the company and certain of its benefit plans in federal district court in chicago on behalf of certain former employees of the chicago catalog operations jefferson  et al 
v 
rr donnelley sons co  et rr the suit alleged that enhanced pension benefits were not paid to plaintiffs and that plaintiffs are being required to contribute to the costs of retiree medical coverage  both allegedly in violation of plan documents and erisa 
the complaint sought recalculation of pension benefits due plaintiffs since their retirement dates  reimbursement of any amounts paid by plaintiffs for medical coverage  interest on the foregoing amounts  as well as a declaration as to the benefits due plaintiffs in the future 
the gerlib and jefferson cases raised many of the same claims for recalculation of benefits due employees and are before the same district court judge 
in an order dated october   further clarified in an order dated january   the district court judge ruled that permanent employees who were eligible and elected to receive special augmented separation pay in conjunction with the closure of the chicago catalog operations were not eligible to also receive regular separation pay  and that employees other than those considered permanent employees at the date of closure were not eligible to receive special augmented separation pay 
in the same order  the judge ruled that under the terms of the company s plans  permanent employees who were eligible and elected to receive enhanced retirement benefits were also entitled to receive regular separation pay 
in an order dated 
table of contents june   the district court judge found that employees who were otherwise not eligible to receive enhanced retirement benefits at the date of closure of the chicago catalog operations but whose combined age and service equaled years or more at the date of their termination were entitled to receive enhanced retirement benefits  and that employees of the chicago catalog operations in who were in surplus occupations were entitled to receive enhanced retirement benefits regardless of their age at the date of termination 
in the june order  the judge further ruled that members of the classes who elected to receive augmented separation pay in connection with the closure of the chicago catalog operations were not entitled to also receive enhanced retirement benefits 
as to other claims of the plaintiffs in the cases  by order dated january   the district court judge granted summary judgment on the jefferson claim relating to medical benefits  finding that retirees from the chicago catalog operations were not entitled to non contributory medical benefits for life 
following a two week trial on the age discrimination claim raised in gerlib  on august   a jury reached a verdict in the company s favor  finding that the company did not discriminate against older workers in the shutdown of the chicago catalog operations 
on august   plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a new trial on the age discrimination claim  alleging that the jury verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence 
that motion was denied on november  the jones  gerlib and jefferson cases relate primarily to the circumstances surrounding the closure of the chicago catalog operations 
the company believes that it acted properly and without discriminating in closing the operations  and that the adverse rulings of the district court judge are based on language contained in the company s plan documents rather than on wrongdoing of the company 
further  the company does not believe that it discriminated against any of the plaintiffs who have made allegations surrounding other operations of the company 
however  rather than continue to litigate the issues in gerlib and jefferson through the appellate process and begin the multiple trials required to decide the claims raised in the adams case  the parties reached agreement on the terms for settlement 
the settlements  which must be approved by the district court following fairness hearings  resolve all of the issues in the adams  gerlib and jefferson cases  and resolve the issues in jones which relate to claims arising in locations other than the chicago catalog operations  without any admission of wrongdoing by the company 
the total amount to be paid in connection with the settlements is million  of which million will be paid by the company s retirement benefit plan 
the total pretax charge during related to these settlements was million  and is included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income on f while the settlements described will dispose of the adams  gerlib and jefferson cases  and a portion of the jones litigation  the issue relating to the application of the statute of limitations to certain of the discrimination claims in the jones case has not been finally decided 
management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the overall loss that could result in the event of an unfavorable final determination of this matter 
in addition  the company is a party to certain litigation arising in the ordinary course of business which  in the opinion of management  will not have a material adverse effect on the operations or financial condition of the company

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in item of part iv of this form k 
significant accounting policies and critical estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the following critical accounting policies and judgments 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available when they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize print revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete 
approximately of our business is under contract 
contracts typically specify fob shipping point terms 
we recognize revenue upon final shipment for a print job and not on a partial shipment basis 
for most print jobs  it is common for customers to inspect the quality of the product at our facilities up to and including at the time of shipment 
our products are not shipped subject to any contractual right of return provisions 
absent specific contract terms  we recognize revenue upon final delivery of the product or upon completion of the service performed 
revenues related to our premedia technologies operations  which include digital content management such as photography  color services and page production  are recognized in accordance with the terms of the contract  typically upon shipment of the completed product if sold as a part of a final printed product  or once the service has been performed and accepted by the customer if sold separately eg  digital photography 
with respect to donnelley logistics  whose operations include the delivery of packages and printed material  we recognize revenue upon completion of the delivery services we provide 
accounting for goodwill and certain other intangibles in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and are required to assess goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at a minimum annually  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step is a screen for impairment  and the second step measures the amount of any impairment 
these tests utilize fair value amounts that are determined by discounting estimated future cash flows developed by management 
we completed the transitional test for impairment in the second quarter of and the annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of we did not record any goodwill impairment in conjunction with these reviews 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to environmental  employment and other matters 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess potential financial exposure 
if 
table of contents the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for a description of certain legal proceedings 
long lived assets we are required to assess potential impairments of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based upon the most recent information available 
estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows developed by management 
long lived assets that are held for disposal are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or the fair market value less the estimated cost to sell 
our long lived assets primarily include property  plant and equipment and other noncurrent assets primarily the costs of acquiring print contracts and volume guarantees that are amortized to net sales over the periods in which benefits will be realized 
investments in affordable housing  which are included in other noncurrent assets  are recorded at cost  as adjusted for any declines in the fair value of the underlying properties that are deemed to be other than temporary 
our basis for determining fair value of the underlying properties requires applying management s judgment using a significant number of estimates 
we derive our estimates of fair value using remaining future tax credits to be received and expected residual values upon sale or disposition of our ownership interests 
expected residual values are developed from industry assumptions and cash flow projections provided by the underlying partnerships  which include certain assumptions with respect to operating costs  debt levels and certain market data related to the properties such as assumed vacancy rates 
should these assumptions differ from actual results in the future  we may be required to further writedown our carrying value of these investments 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  acquisitions and investments  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
defined benefit retirement plans we present the status of our defined benefit obligations and related plan assets in note  retirement plans  to the consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and annual pension and postretirement benefit income are determined by actuaries using a number of key assumptions 
key assumptions include the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets  and the anticipated rate of future salary increases 
we determine the discount rate to be used for purposes of computing annual income or expense as of the beginning of the year using a measurement date of september  based on high quality corporate bond yields as of that date 
the weighted average discount rates assumed for determining annual pension and postretirement income in were and  respectively 
we expect to lower the discount rates for purposes of determining pension and postretirement income to and  respectively  in due to a decline in high quality corporate bond yields as of september  we determine the estimated return on plan assets primarily based on long term historical returns of equity and fixed income markets according to our respective plan allocations 
the weighted average expected asset 
table of contents return for our pension plans as of the end of was 
plan assets for our pension plans are generally allocated as follows domestic equity  non us equity and fixed income securities 
by assuming historic returns of for equity and for fixed income securities as a benchmark  the weighted average expected return based on our pension plan asset allocation would be compared with our assumed rate of 
while we have assumed no change in targeted asset allocation percentages for  we intend to lower our expected long term rate of return to based on declines in equity market performance  primarily over the last three years  versus long term historical averages 
the weighted average expected asset return for our postretirement benefit plans as of the end of was 
plan assets for our postretirement benefit plans are generally allocated as follows domestic equity  non us equity and fixed income securities 
by assuming historic returns of for equity and for fixed income securities  the weighted average expected return based on our postretirement benefit plan allocation would be  which is consistent with our assumptions 
while we have assumed no change in asset allocation percentages for  we intend to lower our expected long term rate of return to based on declines in equity market performance  primarily over the last three years  versus long term historical averages 
as a result of the expected assumption changes for as noted above  we anticipate pension and postretirement income to be reduced by approximately million in we do not expect to make any significant cash contributions to the plans during other matters other than non cancelable operating lease commitments  we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as special purpose entities 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its majority owned subsidiaries 
minority interests in the income or loss of consolidated subsidiaries are included in other income expense in the consolidated income statement 
intercompany items and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
financial review in the financial review that follows  we discuss our results of operations  financial condition and certain other information

the pretax charge included million to close our berea  ohio facility  which is included in the donnelley print solutions segment  as well as additional workforce reductions at several other facilities throughout the company

impact of goodwill amortization as discussed in note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as of january  under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized after the date of adoption of the standard 
sfas no 
does not permit the restatement of previously issued financial statements  but does require disclosure of the impact on prior results adjusted to exclude amortization expense related to goodwill and intangible assets which are no longer being amortized 
results included million million after tax  or per diluted share of goodwill amortization expense 
goodwill amortization expense by segment for was as follows donnelley print solutions million  logistics services million  and other million 

table of contents a summary analysis of expense trends is presented below change change in thousands cost of materials cost of transportation cost of manufacturing depreciation amortization selling and administrative expenses restructuring and impairment charges n a net interest expense excludes depreciation and amortization  which are shown separately 
includes write downs of affordable housing investments classified as other expense  net  of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
results of operations compared with consolidated net sales decreased million  or  to billion compared with billion in  driven by the decline in net sales of our donnelley print solutions segment of 
net sales of our logistics services segment were up between years  with an increase in net sales for the package logistics business partially offset by a decrease of in net sales from print logistics excluding expedited services 
for our print related businesses  value added revenue represents net sales less the cost of materials 
for some customers  we purchase paper used in the printing process and pass through this cost referred to as pass through material sales at a margin that is lower than print and related services  other customers furnish their own paper 
the value of customer furnished paper is not reflected in our financial results 
for our logistics services segment  value added revenue represents net sales less the cost of transportation and postage 
by measuring value added revenue  we eliminate the effect of material prices and transportation costs  as well as mix issues related to customer furnished versus donnelley furnished paper 
consolidated value added revenue decreased million  or  to billion compared with billion in  primarily driven by the decline in value added revenue of our donnelley print solutions segment of 
donnelley print solutions percentage decline in value added revenue was less than the decline in net sales  primarily due to higher customer furnished paper and improved material yield during in addition  value added revenue is affected by the price of by product paper we sell 
income from the sale of by products is recorded as a reduction in cost of materials 
during  we recognized a reduction in cost of materials of million from by product revenues  compared with million a year ago 
value added revenue of our logistics services segment increased between years  due to a increase in value added revenue for package logistics 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin was in compared with in  primarily due to higher gross margins within our donnelley print solutions segment  partially offset by the net effect of several significant items within the corporate segment 
donnelley print solutions gross margin in benefited from restructuring and productivity gains  the impact of lower goodwill amortization million  higher by product revenues million and gain on sale of assets million  which more than offset the gross margin impact from lower net sales

outlook the environment is highly competitive in most of our product categories and geographic regions 
competition is based largely on price  quality and servicing the special needs of customers 
industry analysts believe that there is overcapacity in most commercial printing markets exacerbated by recent drops in market demand 
therefore  competition is intense 
our intent is to differentiate our service offerings so that we are viewed by our customers as a partner that can help them deliver effective and targeted communications in the right format to the right audience at the right time 
we are a large user of paper  supplied to us by our customers or bought by us 
the cost and supply of certain paper grades used in the manufacturing process will continue to affect our financial results 
however  management currently does not foresee any disruptive conditions affecting prices or supply of paper in postal costs are a significant component of our customers cost structures and postal rate changes can influence the number of pieces that our customers are willing to mail 
any resulting decline in print volumes mailed could have an effect on our financial results 
postal rates increased in january  july and july postal rate increases can enhance the value of donnelley logistics to our customers  as we are able to improve the cost efficiency of mail processing and distribution 
this ability to deliver mail on a more precise schedule and at a lower relative cost should enhance our position in the marketplace 
the cost of energy affects our operating costs in the donnelley print solutions segment and transportation costs in donnelley logistics 
in donnelley logistics  increases in fuel costs can be offset by fuel surcharges passed on to customers  but continuing increases in these and other energy costs could affect our consolidated financial results 

table of contents consumer confidence and economic growth are key drivers of demand for our services 
the slowdown experienced in the us and international economies is continuing to affect demand across most of our businesses 
uncertainty in the economy has led customers across our end markets to indicate that they anticipate flat demand throughout in the longer term  technological changes  including the electronic distribution of information  present both risks and opportunities for us 
many of our businesses leverage distinctive capabilities to participate in the rapid growth in electronic communications 
our goal remains to help our customers succeed by delivering effective and targeted communications in the right format to the right audiences at the right time 
we believe that with our competitive strengths  including our comprehensive service offerings  technology leadership  depth of management experience  customer relationships and economies of scale  we can develop the most valuable solutions for our customers  which should result in increased shareholder value
