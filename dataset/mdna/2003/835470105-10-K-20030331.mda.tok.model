critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements  including those related to sales returns and allowances  bad debt  inventory reserves  warranty reserves  restructuring reserves  intangible assets  and deferred taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from primarily three sources i product revenue  which is comprised of hardware based appliances  ii licensing revenue for vpn upgrades  firewall and other software  and asic technology  and iii subscription and service revenues for products such as content filtering and anti virus protection  extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
we may experience material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
we recognize product and service revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
a and sab no 
b 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop no 
 as amended by statement of position sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
for hardware transactions where software is incidental  we do not apply separate accounting guidance to the hardware and software elements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
however  certain distributor agreements provide for rights of return for stock rotation 
these stock rotation rights are generally limited to of the distributor s prior quarter purchases or other measurable restrictions  and we estimate reserves for these return rights as discussed below 
our second largest distributor  ingram micro  has an unlimited stock rotation right  and therefore we do not deem delivery to have occurred for any sales to ingram micro until they sell the product to their customer  at which time their right of return expires 
in january  we amended our agreement with our largest distributor  tech data  and under the amended agreement tech data has the same unlimited stock rotation rights as ingram micro 
these return rights do not apply to any purchases made by tech data prior to january  prior to this amendment  tech data s stock rotation rights were limited to of their prior quarter purchases 
as a result of this amendment  for sales occurring after january   we do not deem delivery to occur for any sales to tech data until they sell the product to their customers  at which time their right of return expires 
we consider either a binding purchase order or signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors and oem partners are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the binding purchase order  including the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are generally to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  an appliance bundled with a year of free maintenance or content filtering  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement based on the objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements  which is generally the average selling price of each element when sold separately 
this means that we defer revenue from the arrangement an amount equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the amounts as revenue when the element is delivered 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize revenue for subscription services such as content filtering and anti virus protection services  extended warranty and service contracts  ratably over the contract term 
our training  consulting and engineering services are generally billed and recognized as revenue as these services are performed 
sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts and warranty reserve 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
we may experience material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
the amount of revenues reserved for returns and other allowances amounted to approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in addition  we must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  and million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  appliance products are generally covered by a warranty for a one to two year period 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services  including the cost of technical support  product repairs  and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired 
our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross profit 
our warranty accrual amounted to approximately million at each of the periods ended december  and valuation of inventory 
we continually assess the valuation of our inventory and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such estimates are difficult to make under current volatile economic conditions 
reviews for excess inventory are done on a quarterly basis and required reserve levels are calculated with reference to our projected ultimate usage of that inventory 
in order to determine the ultimate usage  we take into account forecasted demand  projected obsolescence and our current inventory levels 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
if actual demand is lower than our forecasted demand  and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative effect on our gross margin 
our inventory balance was million  net of allowance for excess and obsolete reserves of million  at december  and million  net of allowance for excess and obsolete reserves of million  at december  this decrease related primarily to the scrapping of inventory that was specifically reserved as of december  accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
deferred tax assets were million  net of a valuation allowance of million at december   and million  net of a valuation allowance of million at december  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the impairment review performed in accordance with sfas no 
involved a two step process as follows step a comparison of the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we will move to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
we currently operate in one reportable segment  which is also the only reporting unit for purposes of sfas no 
since we currently only have one reporting unit  all of the goodwill has been assigned to the enterprise as a whole 
the estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
we completed our annual review during the fourth quarter of upon our annual review  the carrying value of our goodwill exceeded the implied fair value 
as a result  we have recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges totaling million as of december  any further impairment charges recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 
acquisitions on november   we acquired phobos corporation phobos for million in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
phobos designed  developed and sold scaleable ssl solutions for internet service providers  application service providers  e commerce companies and web hosting and enterprise network operations centers 
under the terms of the merger  shares of our common stock were exchanged for each share of outstanding phobos common stock on november   the closing date of the merger 
in connection with the merger  we issued  shares of our common stock and options and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the total purchase price was based upon the average fair value of our common stock for five trading days surrounding the date on which the acquisition was announced 
in addition  we paid million in cash to the shareholders of phobos based upon their pro rata ownership percentage in phobos 
the merger agreement also provided for up to an additional million in cash to be payable upon achievement of certain quarterly revenue targets during  of which million was earned and recorded as additional goodwill 
payments in the amount of million and million were made in and  respectively 
during the quarter ended june   we received  shares of our common stock from phobos in connection with the settlement and termination of the escrow fund  which resulted in a reduction of goodwill of approximately million 
on march   we acquired ignyte technology  inc ignyte in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
ignyte provided in depth consulting  design and support for enterprise networking customers  as well as management of their internet security needs 
as of the acquisition date we recorded the fair value of ignyte s assets and liabilities 
the total purchase price of million was based upon the average fair value of our common stock for five trading days surrounding the date on which the acquisition was announced 
the purchase price consisted of  in cash consideration   in closing costs and  shares issued for common stock and options of ignyte valued at approximately million 
on october   we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of redcreek communications  inc redcreek in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
redcreek developed and sold standards based internet security products for corporate data communications networks that enable the secure transmission of data between offices over the internet 
at the closing of the acquisition  we paid million in cash  assumed certain current accounts payable and other liabilities of redcreek  and forgave repayment of bridge loan amounts payable by redcreek to us that were used by redcreek to fund its operating expense from the date the purchase agreement was signed until the closing of the acquisition 
we also assumed redcreek s stock option plan and  options valued at approximately million issued thereunder 
in the event redcreek products achieve certain quarterly sales targets during to  we are obligated to pay additional purchase consideration of up to million in cash  which payments would be recorded  if and when payable  as adjustments to goodwill 
as of december   no additional payments have been earned 
during the course of  we completed several minor transactions for the acquisition of certain technologies and personnel for an aggregate purchase consideration of  shares of common stock valued at approximately million and approximately million in cash consideration 
during the quarter ended december   we issued  in cash and  shares of our common stock related to one of our acquisitions in restructuring charges during the second quarter of  we approved and initiated a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and integrate certain company functions 
accordingly  we recognized a restructuring charge of approximately million during the second quarter of the restructuring charge consisted of workforce reduction costs across all geographic regions and functions  excess facilities consolidation costs related to lease commitments for space no longer needed to support ongoing operations  and fixed asset impairments 
the estimated facility costs were based on our contractual obligations  net of assumed sublease income  based on current comparable rates for leases in their respective markets 
if facilities operating lease rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease these facilities  the actual loss could exceed this estimate 
future cash outlays are anticipated through december  unless we negotiate to exit the leases at an earlier date 
asset impairments consist primarily of leasehold improvements  computer equipment and related software  and furniture and fixtures 
the restructuring plan resulted in the elimination of positions  all of which were eliminated as of december  activities associated with the restructuring action consist of the following in thousands total charges june  payments non cash charges accrual december  employee severance benefits facility costs asset impairments as a result of the restructuring  we expect to reduce compensation related expenses by approximately million per quarter 
we also expect to reduce facility related operating expenses in the amount of  per quarter  through the lease term expiring at the end of fiscal in the remaining portion of the year ended december   we realized the expected benefits of these efforts 
results of operations the following table sets forth financial data for the years indicated as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  revenue product license and service total revenue cost of revenue product license and service total cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative in process research and development amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets impairment of goodwill restructuring charges stock based compensation total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income and other expense  net income loss before income taxes benefit from provision for income taxes net income loss compared to product revenue 
revenue from sales of our products decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in product revenues was across all geographies  and related primarily to a decrease in revenues from our pro product line 
we believe the decrease in pro product line sales in related to increased competition in the mid tier of our market  which resulted in a lower unit market share and a decrease in the average selling price of this product line by in our small to medium enterprise sme products  including our tele  soho and pro product lines  represented approximately of product revenues in compared to of product revenues in our transaction security and large network access security products  including our ssl and gx product lines and vpn products acquired from redcreek  represented approximately of product revenues in compared to approximately in during  we generated approximately  or million  of product revenues from certain legacy products of acquired entities that have generally been brought to end of life within the first year of combined operations 
these revenues have been generated from network infrastructure products that are not part of our long term product strategy 
during  legacy products represented approximately of product revenues 
we anticipate going forward that a majority of our product revenues will continue to be generated from the sme access security market 
we will continue to reach this market through our distribution and oem channels 
we have established an enterprise sales team to address the needs of large enterprises 
in addition to selling our gx and global management products into central sites of these large networks  we believe that successful penetration of these accounts is a means of furthering our penetration of the sme market products  as the perimeter of these large networks are the branch office and telecommuter opportunities of the sme market 
our enterprise sales team and an oem partner are also selling our transaction security products into large enterprises 
our transaction security product sales into large enterprises represented of total product revenues in we do not expect transaction security revenues to represent more than of total product revenues in  because we believe the size of the transaction security market is much smaller than the sme access security market 
license and service revenue 
revenue from licenses and services decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  license and service revenue is comprised primarily of licenses and services such as vpn upgrades  node upgrades  anti virus protection  and content filtering services that are sold into the installed base of access security appliances 
in addition  we generate license and service revenues from extended service contracts  licensing of our global management software  licensing of our vpn asic  licensing of our firewall software  and professional services related to training  consulting and engineering services professional services and training revenue represents approximately and of service revenue during and  respectively 
we expect the market opportunity for subscription products sold to our installed base to increase as our installed base grows 
we are dedicating increased sales and marketing resources to sell into our installed base  and we are also focusing resources on marketing renewals for existing subscriptions 
during  revenues from our two primary subscription products  content filtering and anti virus  increased to approximately million from million in  primarily due to increased marketing efforts to our installed base 
in addition  in december  we introduced new subscription service offerings across our product lines to provide our customers maintenance releases of our firmware and technical support 
in  revenue from service contracts increased to approximately million from million in  primarily due to this expanded offering and increased marketing efforts to our installed base 
historically  a significant component of our license and service revenue has been vpn and node upgrades  which have been offered to our customers as a separately licensed product after their initial purchase of an appliance 
we continue to offer vpn upgrades to our customers that purchase products without bundled vpn functionality 
however  there has been a trend in our market to offer vpn functionality as a bundled feature in a firewall product  and in response to this trend we have offered our customers the opportunity to purchase our products with bundled vpn functionality 
products sold with bundled vpn generate a higher average selling price than the same product without the bundled vpn functionality 
the result of this trend has been a decline in our vpn upgrade license revenues  offset in part by an increase in our product revenues due to higher average selling prices realized from bundled vpn products 
vpn upgrades represented approximately and of license and service revenues during and  respectively 
we expect this trend to continue as more of our customers choose to purchase vpn functionality through our bundled offerings 
revenues from the licensing of our software and asic technology are more difficult to predict 
unlike our upgrade and subscription products marketed to our installed base  we do not have dedicated sales and marketing resources to pursue licensing transactions for our technology  but rather we pursue these opportunities as they arise 
revenues from the licensing of our software and asic technology decreased to approximately million in from million in this decrease related to a reduction in revenues generated from our oem agreement with netgear  under which they licensed our firewall software for integration into their products 
this decrease also related to the fact that we did not enter into any new license agreements for our asic technology in we do not believe that we will generate additional license revenues from our asic technology in the future due to the maturity of the underlying technology and competitive technologies available on the market 
additionally  we do not believe we will generate further license revenues from netgear during the remaining term of the oem agreement as the amount of revenues generated in the second half of declined to insignificant levels 
channel and geographic revenue data 
our sonicwall products are sold primarily through distributors who then resell our products to resellers and selected retail outlets 
these resellers and retail outlets then sell our products to end users 
two of our distributors  ingram micro and tech data  both of which are global computer equipment and accessory distributors  combined account for approximately and of our revenue in and  respectively 
in  sales to ingram micro and tech data accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
in  sales to ingram micro and tech data accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
distribution channels accounted for approximately and of total revenues in and  respectively 
during  we established an enterprise sales team to focus primarily on sales of our products to large enterprises 
while this sales team has direct contact with the end customer  we fulfill orders to these customers primarily through our indirect channels 
in addition to our distribution channels  we also sell our products to oems who sell our technologies under their brand name 
we have two primary oem partners  which are com and cisco 
neither of these customers represented more than of total revenues in and oem revenues represented approximately and of total revenues in and  respectively 
approximately of our total revenues were generated in domestic markets in compared to approximately in accordingly  international revenues were approximately and of total revenues in and  respectively 
international sales declined slightly to million in compared to million in  a decrease 
in europe  our headcount decreased to approximately employees at the end of from approximately employees at the end of in asia pacific  our headcount increased to approximately in from in we believe our international revenues will continue to represent to of total revenues in cost of product revenue  gross margin 
cost of product revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products  including cost of materials  manufacturing and assembly costs paid to contract manufacturers and related overhead costs associated with our manufacturing operations personnel 
additionally  warranty costs and inventory provisions or write downs are included in cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  primarily as a result of increased overall shipments 
we shipped approximately  total units in compared to  units in  which resulted in an overall average selling price per unit of in compared to in gross margin from product sales decreased to million  or of product revenue  in the year ended december  from million  or of product revenue  in the year ended december  the decrease in product gross margin is primarily attributable to lower average selling prices and unit shipments of our pro products 
cost of license and service revenue  gross margin 
cost of license and service revenue includes all costs associated with the production and delivery of our license and service products  including cost of packaging materials and related costs paid to contract manufacturers  technical support costs related to our service contracts  collection service costs related to certain subscription products and personnel costs related to the delivery of training  consulting and professional services 
cost of license and service revenue increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase related primarily to technical support costs that increased as a result of the introduction of new service contract offerings across our product line at the end of to deliver services under these contracts  we outsourced a significant portion of our technical support function to a third party service provider 
gross margin from license and service sales decreased from million  or of license and service revenues  in to million  or of license and service revenues  in this decrease related primarily to a decrease in sales of certain high gross margin products  including vpn upgrades and asic and firewall software licensing revenue  and increased sales of our lower gross margin service contract offerings 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including competition  the mix and average selling prices of products  new product introductions and enhancements  fluctuations in manufacturing volumes and the cost of components and manufacturing labor 
we must manage each of these factors effectively for our gross margins to remain at current levels 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract consultants  outside testing services and equipment and supplies associated with enhancing existing products and developing new products 
research and development expenses decreased by to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  these expenses represented and  respectively  of total revenue for such periods 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction of approximately million in fees paid to outside consultants  as we scaled these costs back in association with our cost reduction efforts in our restructuring plan implemented in the second quarter of in addition  we reduced our spending on prototype materials in by approximately  we plan to increase our absolute dollar investments in research and development in to expedite the development of certain key technologies that we believe are necessary for us to remain competitive 
in particular  we plan to increase our research and development headcount by approximately employees in to expedite the development of new pro products  new subscription services and a new generation of our firmware 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  including commissions  costs associated with the development of our business and corporate identification  costs related to customer support  travel  tradeshows  promotional and advertising costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  these expenses were and of total revenues for such periods  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to increased salaries and related benefits of approximately million in as a result of the acquisition of redcreek in october and the acquisition of two small resellers in september all of these transactions increased our sales and marketing headcount in the latter part of  and a significant amount of this cost infrastructure remained throughout however  a portion of this increase was offset by the termination of certain sales and marketing personnel in connection with our restructuring  which was implemented in the second quarter of in addition  we increased our public relations and co op advertising costs by approximately million in to improve our brand recognition 
we also incurred higher travel costs of approximately million associated with our enterprise sales efforts and our efforts to increase our international sales 
we expect to continue our sales and marketing expenses in an effort to expand domestic and international markets  introduce new products and establish and expand new distribution channels and oem relationships 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  these expenses represented and of total revenue for such periods  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to an increase of approximately million in executive compensation  including employment termination costs  paid to our former ceo and our former senior vice president of legal and corporate affairs  both of whom were hired in the latter part of in addition  we incurred approximately  of increased legal and other professional service fees related to  among other things  several small legal disputes and increased costs of corporate governance related to implementation of the sarbanes oxley act 
these increases were offset in part by a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  related to a reduction in accounts receivable of approximately million and the favorable resolution of certain specific accounts during we believe that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and remain relatively stable as a percentage of total revenue as we continue to build our infrastructure 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles represents the amortization of the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair market value of the net tangible assets acquired by us in a business acquisition accounted for by us as a purchase 
purchased intangible assets  including existing technology  are being amortized over the estimated useful lives of three to six year periods 
in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangibles related to acquired workforce are no longer being amortized effective january  amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles was million for the year ended december  compared to million as of december  the primary reason for the reduction was the discontinuation of the amortization of goodwill as of january  amortization for the year ended december  primarily consisted of million   and  relating to the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisitions of phobos  redcreek  and ignyte  respectively 
amortization for the year ended december  primarily consisted of million and million associated with the acquisitions of phobos and ignyte  respectively 
of the amortization expense in the year ended december   million related to the amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles related to acquired workforce 
impairment of goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge totaling million against goodwill and included the charge in operating expenses 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we performed a transition impairment analysis  which resulted in no impairment as of january  in addition as required by sfas no 
 we performed an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge totaling million 
the impairment review performed in accordance with sfas no 
involved a two step process as follows step a comparison of the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we will move to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this will derive an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we will then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess 
we currently operate in one reportable segment  which is also the only reporting unit for purposes of sfas no 
since we currently only have one reporting unit  all of the goodwill has been assigned to the enterprise as a whole 
the tests described above were performed with the assistance of independent valuation experts 
the discounted cash flow methodology was the primary method used to determine the fair values for sfas no 
impairment purposes 
in performing these analyses  we used the best information available under the circumstances  including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections of future operating results 
the discount rate used in the analysis was  which was based on historical risk premiums required by investors for companies of our size  industry and capital structure and included risk factors specific to the sectors in which we operate 
any further impairment charges recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations 
we did not record any write downs of goodwill or other long lived assets in restructuring charges 
as previously discussed  during the second quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan designed to reduce our cost structure and integrate certain company functions 
accordingly  we recognized a restructuring charge of approximately million during the second quarter of the restructuring plan consists of workforce reductions across all geographic regions and functions and excess facilities consolidations related to lease commitments for space no longer needed to support ongoing operations and fixed asset impairments 
the restructuring plan resulted in the elimination of approximately positions worldwide  all of which were eliminated as of december  stock based compensation 
stock based compensation was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the december  amortization amount includes   and  relating to deferred stock compensation associated with the employee stock options issued in connection with the phobos  ignyte and redcreek acquisitions  respectively

sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we classified our short term investments as available for sale 
consequently  investments are recorded on the balance sheet at the fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments included money markets securities  corporate bonds  municipal bonds and commercial paper which are subject to no interest rate risk when held to maturity  but may increase or decrease in value if interest rates changes prior to maturity 
as stated in our investment policy  we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio

we invoice substantially all of our foreign customers from the united states in us dollars and substantially all revenue is collected in us dollars 
for the year ended december   we earned approximately of our revenue from international markets  which in the future may be denominated in various currencies 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of some currencies in relation to the us dollar and diverging economic conditions in foreign markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not affect adversely our financial results in the future 
in addition  we have minimal cash balances denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies and do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
