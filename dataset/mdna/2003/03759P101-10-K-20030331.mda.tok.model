on march   we sold  shares of registered common stock at per share for gross proceeds of million 
because the shares of common stock were issued below per share  the anti dilution provision contained in the august purchase agreement was triggered and as a result  on april   we issued  unregistered shares of common stock to certain of our investors

in compliance with regulatory requirements  we intend to hold a shareholder s meeting to approve certain aspects of the transaction  in connection with the shareholder s meeting  we have already secured irrevocable proxies from certain of our existing shareholders to vote in favor of the transaction and believe that it will have a strong favorable majority vote 
the selected pro forma financial information summarized below shows the effect of the net proceeds from the equity financing transaction received on february  and february  and from the convertible debt financing completed on march  as if the closing of that transaction had occurred  and the net proceeds from those transactions had taken place  on december  balance sheet data pro forma december december  cash and current investments   total assets   convertible debentures   total liabilities   total stockholders equity deficit   weighted average shares outstanding   subject to certain conditions  including  without limitation  i our common stock continuing to be listed on the nasdaq and it not having been suspended from trading or having been threatened with delisting by the nasdaq  or having fallen below the minimum standards for continued listing  ii no event of default having occurred under the convertible debentures then outstanding  iii our performance of our obligation to deliver shares of our common stock upon the conversion of the then outstanding notes and warrants  iv payment of interest on a timely basis  and iv our share price remaining above a share  one investor will be obligated to purchase an additional million of convertible debentures

nasdaq listing on october  and on november   we received notices from the staff of the nasdaq national market that our common stock had failed to maintain certain minimum requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq national market and both of the notices suggested that we may want to consider applying to transfer our securities to the nasdaq smallcap market 
we were subsequently advised by nasdaq that we had regained compliance with certain minimum requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq national market and that our common stock would continue to be listed on the nasdaq national market  pending future review 
because our share price is below per share  we are currently not in compliance with the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq national market and as a result our common stock may be delisted 
in the event that our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  we would apply to list our common shares on the nasdaq smallcap market 
even if we had to move our securities from the nasdaq national market  we believe that we satisfy all the criteria for listing our common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market which  among others  requires that our share price not fall below there is no assurance  however  that our application for trading our common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market would be accepted or  if accepted  that we would be able to maintain eligibility for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if our common stock were to be delisted from the nasdaq national market and not accepted for listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  it could adversely affect our ability to raise funds through stock and debt issuances 
strategic outlook we intend to reduce our spending during the next twelve months by more than to less than million from approximately the million during the months of fiscal year we will pursue our primary objective of filing for approval to market gdt for monotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer patients in the european union  canada and australia by september we currently have a strategic alliance with aventis pasteur whereby aventis pasteur will exclusively promote  advertise  market  distribute and sell our anti gastrine vaccine gdt in north america and europe 
we intend to license gdt to third parties to treat human cancers in other markets worldwide  including japan 
we also intend to license  worldwide  products based on our monoclonal antibody platform targeting gastrin receptors on gastrointestinal system cancers and license  worldwide  gdt for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease 
we believe that our existing and anticipatec capital resources which are comprised primarily of cash and short term cash investments  including the proceeds of equity or other convertible debt financings or other financings and interest thereon  would enable us to maintain our currently planned operations through the year ending december  our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the following the progress of our research and development program  pre clinical testing and clinical trials  the timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  the levels of resources that we devote to product development  manufacturing and marketing capabilities  technological advances  competition  and collaborative arrangements or strategic alliances with other drug companies  including the further development  manufacturing and marketing of certain of our products  our ability to maintain our listing status at the nasdaq national market or  if necessary  the nasdaq smallcap market and our ability to obtain funds from such strategic alliances or from other sources 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
in the event that we require additional funds  we may be required to sell additional equity securities  convertible debt or otherwise  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners 
if we are unable to complete such transactions  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs 
we have incurred recurring operating losses since inception and have a negative working capital at december  of approximately million 
our independent auditors added a paragraph to its opinion on the consolidated financial statements for the year ending december  with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the financings completed subsequent to december  management believes that the receipt and application of proceeds from these financings  including the million financing completed on march   the second million tranche it expects to complete and our plan to reduce spending to less than million during the next months will allow us to operate into the first quarter of  without any additional funds 
accordingly  management believes that after the receipt of these funds  the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern will no longer exist 
critical accounting policies the sec has recently issued financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggesting companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
aphton believes the following represent the critical accounting policies of aphton as contemplated by frr for a summary of all aphton s significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see note to the accompanying financial statements 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  however management believes such differences are unlikely to be significant 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
these costs include internal research and development costs  the salaries of dedicated personnel  the allocated salaries of personnel who also perform general and administrative tasks  the costs of the dedicated research and development facilities and the costs of contracted researchers 
there is no allocation of administrative expense or corporate costs to research and development costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses represent expenses not clearly related to research and development expense 
a significant portion of these expenses are related to intellectual property patent legal costs and salaries  which are typically excluded from research and development according to statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for research and development costs 
equipment and improvements equipment and improvements are depreciated using accelerated methods over the estimated economic lives years of the assets 
improvements are amortized over the term of the lease  or the life of the asset  whichever is shorter  using the straight line method 
betterments that substantially extend the useful life of equipment and furniture generally reduce the accumulated depreciation of the respective asset 
income taxes aphton accounts for income taxes pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  the amount of deferred tax asset or liability is calculated by applying the provisions of enacted tax laws to the differences in the bases of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax purposes 
income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
aphton regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based upon historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  aphton has established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
investment securities investment securities consist principally of debt securities issued by the us treasury and other us government agencies and corporations and investment in other securities  including mutual funds 
investment securities are classified into three categories and accounted for as follows held to maturity securities are debt securities that aphton has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity 
these securities are reported at amortized cost 
trading securities are securities which are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
these securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in current earnings 
available for sale securities are debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities 
aphton does not have available for sale securities 
gains and losses realized on the sales of investment securities are determined using the specific identification method 
aphton s trading securities consist of mutual funds and relate to a company plan whereby certain individuals may forego immediate receipt of wages 
in connection therewith  aphton establishes a liability for accrued wages and records the related compensation expense as services are performed 
further  aphton segregates an amount of funds in investment accounts equal to the liability for accrued wages 
the investment accounts trading securities remain assets of aphton  and are subject to the general creditors of aphton 
upon transfer of the funds to the investment accounts  the employees direct the specific investment of the funds 
the changes in value in the investment accounts trading securities are recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the statements of operations  with a corresponding increase or decrease to research and development expense and the liability for employees wages and benefits 
concentrations of credit risk aphton s short term cash investments are held in several financial institutions and consist principally of insured money market accounts and cash management accounts that are collateralized by or invested in us government and us government agency securities 
aphton s held to maturity securities consist of marketable debt securities 
these securities are issued by a diversified selection of corporate and us government agencies with strong credit ratings 
aphton s investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution 
other than asset backed securities  these debt securities are generally not collateralized 
aphton has not experienced any material losses due to credit impairment on investments in marketable debt securities in any year 
unconditional supply commitment aphton has the unconditional right to receive supplies originally aggregating million from aventis pasteur 
aphton s policy is to review the current market prices of available supplies  if any  to assure that they remain above the stated aventis pasteur contract price of the materials and that the right to receive the supplies remains unimpaired 
aventis pasteur is one of the largest pharmaceutical vaccine manufacturers in the world 
aphton monitors the financial performance of aventis pasteur to assure that they will continue to be able to perform under the contract  wherein the special order supplies are to be provided from supplies manufactured by aventis pasteur in large quantities and sold to many customers  including the us government  as part of aventis pasteur s basic franchise business 
the contract allows for inflation based increases in the per unit costs of the supplies which aphton and aventis pasteur believe are sufficient to assure that there will be no future financial hardship incurred by aventis pasteur in the execution of the agreement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aphton s market risks are all immaterial 
investment securities consist principally of debt securities issued by the us treasury and other us government agencies and corporations and investment in other securities  including mutual funds
