critical accounting policies and estimates general 
our investments are generally made in office properties 
we are  therefore  generally subject to risks incidental to the ownership of real estate 
some of these risks include changes in supply or demand for office properties or tenants for such properties in an area in which we have buildings  changes in real estate tax rates  and changes in federal income tax  real estate and zoning laws 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of parkway properties  inc and its majority owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our significant accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies due to the increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following impairment or disposal of long lived assets and allowance for doubtful accounts impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in the supply or demand of tenants for our properties could impact our ability to fill available space 
should a significant amount of available space exist for an extended period  our investment in a particular office building may be impaired 
we evaluate our real estate assets upon the occurrence of significant adverse changes to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that affect the recovery of the carrying amount 
real estate assets are classified as held for sale or held and used in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
with respect to assets classified as held and used  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
in  the company recorded an impairment loss on its office property in greenville  south carolina in the amount of million and on acres of non earning land in new orleans  louisiana in the amount of  the loss on the greenville property was created largely by rental rate decreases and current conditions within the market 
the loss on the new orleans land was computed based on market research and comparable sales in the area and necessary to reflect the land at fair value less cost to sell 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of rents and operating expense recoveries due from tenants 
change in the supply of or demand for office properties could impact our tenants ability to honor their lease obligations  which could in turn affect our recorded revenues and estimates of the collectibility of our receivables 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized and accrued as earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the lease 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts considering such factors as credit quality of our tenants  delinquency of payment  historical trends and current economic conditions 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for tenant balances that are over days past due and for specific tenant receivables for which collection is considered doubtful 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
funds from operations and funds available for distribution management believes that funds from operations ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity reits and computes this measure in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
we believe ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure that enhances the comparability of our operations by adjusting net income for items not reflective of our principal and recurring operations 
in addition  ffo has widespread acceptance and use within the reit and analyst communities 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
in  nareit clarified that ffo related to assets held for sale  sold or otherwise transferred and included in results of discontinued operations should continue to be included in consolidated ffo 
this clarification is effective january   and calculation of ffo based on this clarification should be shown for all periods presented in financial statements or tables 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with the net income as presented in our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
funds from operations do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is not an indication of cash available to fund cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the computation of funds available for distribution fad is equal to ffo increased by amortization of restricted stock grants and reduced by rental income from straight line rents  non revenue enhancing capital expenditures for building improvements  tenant improvements and leasing costs 
adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated on the same basis 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the company s net income to ffo and fad for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december net income adjustments to derive funds from operations extraordinary items depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization discontinued operations adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures preferred dividends convertible preferred dividends gain loss on real estate and joint venture interest amortization of deferred gains and other funds from operations adjustments to derive funds available for distribution amortization of restricted stock grants straight line rents adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures building improvements tenant improvements new leases tenant improvements renewal leases leasing costs new leases leasing costs renewal leases funds available for distribution inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company s leases typically have three to seven year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base rent if rents on the existing leases are below the then existing market rate
