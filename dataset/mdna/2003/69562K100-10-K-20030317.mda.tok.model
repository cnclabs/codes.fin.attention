overview pain therapeutics  inc is developing a new generation of opioid painkillers with improved clinical benefits 
we believe our drugs will offer enhanced pain relief or reduced tolerance physical dependence or addiction potential compared to existing opioid painkillers 
we conduct our research and development programs through a combination of internal and collaborative programs 
we rely on arrangements with universities  contract research organizations and clinical research sites for a significant portion of our product development efforts 
our lead product candidate is oxytrex tm  a next generation version of immediate release oxycodone 
in the second quarter of we plan to complete enrollment of patients and announce results from a day phase ii study of oxytrex tm in patients with severe osteoarthritic pain and initiate a phase iii clinical trial to examine the safety and efficacy of oxytrex tm in patients with severe chronic low back pain 
we have several other opioid painkillers in various stages of clinical testing 
we have yet to generate any revenues from product sales 
we have not been profitable and  since our inception through december   we have incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately million 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  including costs of preclinical and clinical trials as well as clinical supplies associated with our product candidates  salaries and other personnel related costs  including the amortization of deferred compensation associated with options granted to employees and non employees  and general corporate 
table of contents expenses 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially from period to period as a result of the timing and enrollment rates of clinical trials for our product candidates and our need for clinical supplies 
we expect to incur significant additional operating losses for the next several years 
we also expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to undertake preclinical and clinical trials for our product candidates  seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates  develop  formulate  manufacture and commercialize our drugs  implement additional internal systems and develop new infrastructure  acquire or in license additional products or technologies  or expand the use of our technology  maintain  defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property  and hire additional personnel 
product revenue will depend on our ability to receive regulatory approvals for  and successfully market  our product candidates 
in the event that our development efforts result in regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our product candidates  we will generate revenue from direct sales of our products and or  if we license our products to future collaborators  from the receipt of license fees and royalties from licensed products 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and interest income in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to contract agreements  research collaborations and investments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following items in our financial statements require significant estimates and judgments expenses for clinical trials 
expenses for clinical trials are incurred from planning through patient enrollment to reporting of the underlying data 
we estimate expenses incurred for clinical trials that are in process based on patient enrollment and based on clinical data collection and management 
costs that are associated with patient enrollment are recognized as each patient in the trial completes enrollment 
costs that are based on clinical data collection and management are recognized based on estimates of unbilled goods and services received 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we accrue an amount based on estimates of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with winding down the trial 
stock based compensation 
we use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based awards granted to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and its related interpretations 
accordingly  we would recognize compensation expense in our financial statements in connection with stock options granted to employees with exercise prices less than fair value at the time the stock option is granted 
we record stock based compensation expense for non employees at the fair value of the options granted in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas and emerging issues task force no 
eitf 
the fair value of options granted to non employees is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the model considers a number of factors  including the market price and volatility of our common stock at the date of measurement 
we periodically re measure the compensation expense for options granted to non employees as the underlying options vest 
the compensation expense related to all grants is being 
table of contents amortized using the graded vesting method  in accordance with sfas  eitf and fasb interpretation no 
 over the vesting period of each respective stock option  generally four years 
the graded vesting method results in expensing approximately of the total award in year one  in year two  in year three and in year four 
results of operations years ended december  and research and development research and development expense consists primarily of drug development work associated with our product candidates  including costs of preclinical  clinical trials  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs and salaries and other personnel related expenses  as well as non cash stock based compensation 
research and development expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the million decrease from year to year was primarily due to a decrease in non cash stock based compensation 
at december  our research and development activities were primarily related to oxytrex tm 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a day  multi dose safety study for oxytrex tm 
we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as we expand our development efforts and as our product candidates progress through various stages of clinical trials including a phase iii trial of oxytrex tm 
this increase may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of these activities 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation  facilities expenses and other general corporate expenses as well as non cash stock based compensation 
the year to year decrease of million was primarily due to a decrease in non cash stock based compensation  partially offset by increases in depreciation and general corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expense to increase in future years in support of increased research and development or general corporate activities 
non cash stock based compensation we recognized non cash stock based compensation expense for options granted as a component of both research and development expense and general and administrative expense totaling million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease was principally the result of the lower market price of our common stock during as compared to  the impact of the reversal of previously expensed options returned to the company due to employee turnover as well as the accelerated amortization methodology utilized in accordance with fin interest income interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from the lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents and to a lesser extent from the decline in interest rates during years ended december  and research and development expenses research and development expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year to year decrease of million was primarily due to the decrease in non cash stock based compensation as described below partially offset by increases in preclinical and clinical development activities  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs  salaries and other personnel related costs associated with increases in staff to support these activities 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the year to year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in non cash stock based compensation as described below partially offset by increases in salaries and other personnel related costs associated with increased staffing  consulting and professional services expenses and other general corporate expenses 
non cash stock based compensation we recognized non cash stock based compensation expense for options granted as well as restricted stock purchase agreements as components of both research and development expense and general and administrative expense totaling million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was principally the result of the lower market price of our common stock during as compared to  the accelerated amortization methodology utilized in accordance with fin and the inclusion of million of compensation expense related to restricted stock purchase agreements in the period 
interest income interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents principally as a result of the completion of our initial public offering in july  partially offset by declining interest rates in the period 
return to series c preferred stockholders for beneficial conversion feature in february  we issued  shares of series c redeemable convertible preferred stock for million  net of issuance costs 
we determined that our series c redeemable convertible preferred stock was issued with a beneficial conversion feature 
the value of the beneficial conversion feature was recognized by allocating to additional paid in capital a portion of the preferred stock  limited to the net proceeds received 
as our series c redeemable convertible preferred stock was convertible into common stock at the option of the holder  at the issuance date of the preferred stock the entire million was allocated to the intrinsic value of that feature and has been treated as a dividend and recognized as a return to the preferred stockholders for purposes of computing basic and diluted loss per share for the year ended december  upon the closing of our initial public offering in july  all  shares of our series c redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into shares of common stock on a one to one basis 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private stock offerings 
we intend to continue to use these proceeds to fund research and development activities  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents were million net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million in and million in cash used in operating activities related primarily to the funding of operating losses partially offset by non cash charges related to equity related compensation 
our investing activities used cash of  in the year ended december  and million in each of the years ended december  and investing activities consisted of tenant improvements in conjunction with the build out of new office space in the and periods as well as the purchases of property and equipment 
we expect to continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our operations 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds 
our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million in the amount in the year 
table of contents consisted primarily of net proceeds of million from the issuance of our series c redeemable convertible preferred stock in february and net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in july we lease approximately  square feet of general office space 
in addition to office space we also lease equipment pursuant to operating leases 
our leases expire at various dates through under the terms of all of our leases  future minimum lease payments are million in each of the years through we have license agreements that require us to make milestone payments upon the successful achievement of milestones  including clinical milestones 
these agreements also require us to pay certain royalties to our licensors if we succeed in fully commercializing products under these license agreements 
none of these potential future payments are non cancelable as of december  since our inception we have incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately million  including a net loss of million in  and we expect to incur significant additional operating losses for the next several years 
since inception we have used million of cash in operating activities and million of cash in investing activities 
we expect our cash requirements to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to undertake preclinical and clinical trials for our product candidates  including the planned initiation of a phase iii trial of oxytrex tm  seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates  develop  formulate  manufacture and commercialize our drugs  implement additional internal systems and develop new infrastructure  acquire or in license additional products or technologies  or expand the use of our technology  maintain  defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property  and hire additional personnel 
the amount and timing of cash requirements will depend on regulatory and market acceptance of our products candidates and the resources we devote to researching and developing  formulating  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our products 
we believe that our current resources should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
we may seek additional future funding through public or private financing within this timeframe  if such funding is available and on terms acceptable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
during  which did not have any impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  an interpretation of sfas no 
  and and rescission of fin no 
the objective of this new guidance is to record the fair value of a guarantee at inception 
disclosures will be required for interim or annual financial statements for periods ending after december  the fair values of guarantees issued after december  must be recognized at inception 
we adopted the disclosure requirements of fin in  which did not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires that companies that control another entity through interests other than voting interests should consolidate the controlled entity 
fin applies to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest in after that date 

table of contents the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year of interim period beginning after june  certain disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the adoption of fin is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this form k 
risks and uncertainties  in addition to those we describe below  that are not presently known to us  or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks 
our brief operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess its future viability 
we were founded in may and are in the development stage 
our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company  acquiring  developing and securing our technology and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we have not yet demonstrated our ability to obtain regulatory approval  formulate and manufacture product or conduct sales and marketing activities 
consequently  any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history 
we have a history of losses and expect to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future 
we have incurred net losses each year since our inception 
as a result of ongoing operating losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our drugs  we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future  and we may never become profitable 
we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to undertake preclinical and clinical trials for our product candidates  including the planned initiation of a phase iii trial of oxytrex tm  seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates  develop  formulate  manufacture and commercialize our drugs  implement additional internal systems and develop new infrastructure  acquire or in license additional products or technologies  or expand the use of our technology  maintain  defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property  and hire additional personnel 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
if we cannot successfully develop and commercialize our products  we will not be able to generate such revenues or achieve profitability in the future 
our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
if we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms  we may be unable to complete planned additional clinical trials of any or some of our product candidates 
we have funded all of our operations and capital expenditures with the proceeds from public and private stock offerings 
we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds sooner and additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
even if 
table of contents we succeed in selling additional equity or convertible debt securities to raise funds  our existing stockholders ownership percentage would be reduced and new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
if we do not succeed in raising additional funds  we may be unable to complete planned clinical trials or obtain fda approval of our product candidates  and we could be forced to discontinue product development  reduce sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities 
if outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs  or if their performance is substandard  our regulatory submissions and our product introductions may be delayed 
we depend on independent investigators and collaborators  such as universities and medical institutions  to conduct our clinical trials under agreements with us 
these collaborators are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs 
these investigators may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves 
if outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs  or if their performance is substandard  the approval of our regulatory submissions and our introductions of new drugs will be delayed 
our collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities  some of which may compete with us 
if outside collaborators assist our competitors to our detriment  the approval of our regulatory submissions will be delayed and the sales from our products will be less than expected 
if we are unable to design  conduct and complete clinical trials successfully  we will not be able to submit a new drug application to the fda 
in order to obtain fda approval of any of our product candidates  we must submit to the fda a new drug application  or nda  which demonstrates that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its intended use 
this demonstration requires significant research and animal tests  which are referred to as preclinical studies  as well as human tests  which are referred to as clinical trials 
we have several drug candidates in various stages of clinical testing 
we are currently enrolling patients in a day phase ii study of oxytrex tm in patients with severe osteoarthritic pain 
we expect to complete patient enrollment in this study in the second quarter of clinical data from this study is expected to support further clinical studies of oxytrex tm 
if clinical data from the day phase ii study does not support further clinical studies of oxytrex tm  we may also elect to discontinue further development of drug candidates that utilize technology we licensed from albert einstein college of medicine 
we have designed and plan to initiate in the second quarter of a phase iii clinical trial of oxytrex tm to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of oxytrex tm in non malignant  documented severe chronic low back pain 
in addition  in october we announced a pilot program directed at the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with low dose opioid antagonist 
we will have to commit substantial time and additional resources to conducting further preclinical and clinical studies in several types of pain before we can submit ndas with respect to any of our product candidates 
clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement  in part because they are subject to rigorous requirements 
the clinical trial process is also time consuming 
furthermore  if we or the fda believe that participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  we will have to suspend our clinical trials 
failure can occur at any stage of the trials  and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat clinical studies 
success in early trials may not predict success of future trials 
success in pre clinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful 
results of later clinical trials may not replicate the results of prior clinical trials and pre clinical testing 

table of contents even if our clinical trials are completed as planned  their results may not support our product claims 
the clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe for humans and effective for indicated uses 
such failure would cause us to abandon a product candidate and could delay development of other product candidates 
clinical trial designs that were discussed and agreed upon with authorities prior to their commencement may subsequently be considered insufficient for approval at the time of application for regulatory approval 
we discuss with and obtain guidance from regulatory authorities on certain of our clinical trials 
over the course of conducting our clinical trials  circumstances may change  such as standards of safety or efficacy  that could affect regulatory authorities perception of the adequacy of any of our trial designs 
even with successful clinical safety and efficacy data  we may be required to conduct additional  expensive trials to obtain regulatory approval 
developments by competitors may establish standards of care that affect our ability to conduct our clinical trials as planned 
we have conducted clinical trials of our products comparing our products to both placebo and other approved drugs 
changes in standards related to clinical trial design could affect our ability to design and conduct clinical trials as planned 
for example  regulatory authorities may not allow us to compare our drug to placebo in a particular clinical indication where approved products are available 
in that case  both the cost and the amount of time required to conduct a trial could increase 
if we fail to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  we will not be allowed to commercialize our drugs  and we will not generate product revenues 
satisfaction of all regulatory requirements typically takes many years  is dependent upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product candidate  and requires the expenditure of substantial resources for research and development and testing 
our research and clinical approaches may not lead to drugs that the fda considers safe for humans and effective for indicated uses 
the fda may require us to conduct additional clinical testing  in which case we would have to expend additional time and resources 
the approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation  future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may delay commercialization of  and product revenues from  our product candidates  impose costly procedures on us  and diminish the competitive advantages that we would otherwise enjoy 
even if we comply with all fda requests  the fda may ultimately deny one or more of our ndas  and we may never obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
if we fail to achieve regulatory approval of any of our leading product candidates we will have fewer saleable products and corresponding product revenues 
even if we receive regulatory approval of our products  such approval may involve limitations on the indicated uses or marketing claims we may make for our products 
further  later discovery of previously unknown problems could result in additional regulatory restrictions  including withdrawal of products 
the fda may also require us to commit to perform post approval studies  for which we would have to expend additional resources  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in foreign jurisdictions  we must receive marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize our drugs 
foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the aforementioned requirements and risks associated with fda approval 

table of contents government agencies may establish and promulgate guidelines that directly apply to us and our products that may affect the use of our drugs 
government agencies  professional societies  and other groups may establish guidelines that apply to our drugs 
these guidelines could address such matters as usage and dose  among other factors 
application of such guidelines could mitigate the use of our drugs 
if physicians and patients do not accept and use our drugs  we will not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer 
even if the fda approves our drugs  physicians and patients may not accept and use them 
acceptance and use of our drugs will depend on a number of factors including perceptions by members of the healthcare community  including physicians  about the safety and effectiveness of our drugs  cost effectiveness of our drugs relative to competing products  availability of reimbursement for our products from government or healthcare payers  and effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors  if any 
because we expect to rely on sales generated by our current lead product candidates for substantially all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future  the failure of any of these drugs to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing 
if third party manufacturers of our product candidates fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our concerns  or if their performance is substandard  our clinical trials and product introductions may be delayed and our costs may be higher than expected 
we have no manufacturing facilities and have limited experience in drug product development and commercial manufacturing 
we lack the resources and expertise to formulate  manufacture or test the technical performance of our product candidates 
we currently rely on a limited number of experienced personnel and a small number of contract manufacturers and other vendors to formulate  test  supply  store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials 
our reliance on a limited number of vendors exposes us to the following risks  any of which could delay our clinical trials  and  consequently  fda approval of our product candidates and commercialization of our products  result in higher costs  or deprive us of potential product revenues contract commercial manufacturers  their sub contractors or other third parties we rely on  may encounter difficulties in achieving the volume of production needed to satisfy clinical needs or commercial demand  may experience technical issues that impact quality  and may experience shortages of qualified personnel to adequately staff production operations 
our contract manufacturers could default on their agreements with us to provide clinical supplies or meet our requirements for commercialization of our products 
the use of alternate manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers that have the necessary governmental licenses to produce narcotic products is limited 
additionally  the fda must approve any alternative manufacturer of our product before we may use the alternative manufacturer to produce our supplies 
it may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer on acceptable terms quickly  or at all 
our contract manufacturers and vendors may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to successfully produce  store and distribute our products 
if any third party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products  we may not own  or may have to share  the intellectual property rights to such innovation 

table of contents we rely on third party commercial drug manufacturers for drug supply 
approved third party commercial drug manufacturers may subsequently be stopped from producing  storing  shipping or testing our drug products due to their non compliance with federal  state or local regulations 
drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the fda  the dea and corresponding state and foreign government agencies to ensure strict compliance with good manufacturing practice and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
we do not have control over third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
our collaborative agreements may not succeed or may give rise to disputes over intellectual property 
our strategy to focus on drug discovery of novel drugs discovered by third parties requires us to enter into collaborative agreements from time to time 
collaborative agreements are generally complex and contain provisions that could give rise to legal disputes 
such disputes can delay the development of potential new drug products  or can lead to lengthy  expensive litigation or arbitration 
collaborative agreements often take longer to conclude and may be more expensive to conduct than originally expected 
other factors relating to collaborative agreements may adversely affect the success of our potential products  including the development of parallel products by our collaborators or by a competitor  arrangements with collaborative partners that limit or preclude us from developing certain products or technologies  premature termination of a collaborative agreement  or failure by a collaborative partner to devote sufficient resources to the development of our potential products 
if we are unable to develop our own sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or if we are not successful in contracting with third parties for these services on favorable terms  our product revenues could be disappointing 
we currently have no sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
in order to commercialize our products  if any are approved by the fda  we will either have to develop such capabilities internally or collaborate with third parties who can perform these services for us 
if we decide to commercialize any of our drugs ourselves  we may not be able to hire the necessary experienced personnel and build sales  marketing and distribution operations which are capable of successfully launching new drugs and generating sufficient product revenues 
in addition  establishing such operations will take time and involve significant expense 
if we decide to enter into co promotion or other licensing arrangements with third parties  we may be unable to locate acceptable collaborators because the significant number of recent business combinations among pharmaceutical companies has resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators 
even if we are able to identify one or more acceptable collaborators  we may not be able to enter into any collaborative arrangements on favorable terms  or at all 
in addition  due to the nature of the market for pain management products  it may be necessary for us to license all or substantially all of our product candidates to a single collaborator  thereby eliminating our opportunity to commercialize other painmanagement products independently 
if we enter into any collaborative arrangements  our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we marketed and sold our products ourselves 
in addition  any revenues we receive would depend upon the our collaborators efforts which may not be adequate due to lack of attention or resource commitments  management turnover  change of strategic focus  further business combinations or other factors outside of our control 
depending upon the terms of our collaboration  the remedies we have against an under performing collaborator may be limited 
if we were to terminate the relationship  it may be difficult or impossible to find a replacement collaborator on acceptable terms  or at all 

table of contents if we cannot compete successfully for market share against other drug companies  we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer 
the market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances 
if our products receive fda approval  they will compete with a number of existing and future drugs and therapies developed  manufactured and marketed by others 
existing or future competing products may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products  or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost 
if our products are unable to capture and maintain market share  we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer 
we will compete for market share against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies or other companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations 
many of these competitors have opioid painkillers already approved or in development 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  operate larger research and development programs and have substantially greater financial resources than we do  as well as significantly greater experience in developing drugs  undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of drugs  formulating and manufacturing drugs  and launching  marketing  distributing and selling drugs 
developments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
alternative technologies and products are being developed to improve or replace the use of opioids for pain management  several of which are in clinical trials or are awaiting approval from the fda 
in addition  companies that sell generic opioid drugs represent substantial competition 
many of these organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities  greater experience in drug development and in obtaining regulatory approvals and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do 
these organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and partners for acquisitions  joint ventures or other collaborations 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property our competitors could develop and market products with similar features that may reduce demand for our products 
our success  competitive position and potential future revenues will depend in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
if either we  albert einstein college of medicine or our other collaborators fail to file  prosecute or maintain certain patents  our competitors could market products that contain features and clinical benefits similar to those of our products  and demand for our products could decline as a result 
in january  the us patent and trademark office disclosed that a law firm for an unidentified third party filed requests for an ex parte reexamination related to certain claims on patents we exclusively licensed from albert einstein college of medicine 
an adverse outcome of the reexamination process could result in loss of claims of these patents that pertain to certain drugs we have currently under development 
we intend to file additional patent applications relating to our technology  products and processes 
we may direct albert einstein college of medicine or our collaborators to file additional patent applications relating to the licensed technology or we may do so ourselves 
however  our competitors may challenge  invalidate or circumvent any of our current or future patents 
these patents may also fail to provide us with meaningful competitive advantages 

table of contents we may become involved in expensive litigation or other legal proceedings related to our existing intellectual property rights  including patents 
we expect that we will rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or know how or require us to license such information and pay significant fees or royalties in order to produce our products 
our technology could infringe upon claims of patents owned by others 
if we were found to be infringing on a patent held by another  we might have to seek a license to use the patented technology 
in that case  we might not be able to obtain such a license on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if a legal action were to be brought against us or our licensors  we could incur substantial defense costs  and any such action might not be resolved in our favor 
if such a dispute were to be resolved against us  we could have to pay the other party large sums of money and our use of our technology and the testing  manufacture  marketing or sale of one or more of our proposed products could be restricted or prohibited 
competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical industry is intense  and if we are not successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel  we could experience delays in completing necessary clinical trials and the regulatory approval process or in formulating  manufacturing  marketing and selling our potential products 
we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in clinical research  preclinical testing  government regulation  formulation and manufacturing and sales and marketing 
we compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies  universities and other research institutions 
competition for such individuals  particularly in the san francisco bay area  is intense  and our search for such personnel may not be successful 
attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success 
the dea limits the availability of the active ingredients in our current product candidates and  as a result  our quota may not be sufficient to complete clinical trials  meet commercial demand or may result in clinical delays 
the dea regulates chemical compounds as schedule i  ii  iii  iv or v substances  with schedule i substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and schedule v substances the lowest risk 
the active ingredients in our current product candidates  including morphine  hydrocodone and oxycodone  are listed by the dea as schedule ii or iii substances under the controlled substances act of consequently  their manufacture  shipment  storage  sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation 
for example  all schedule ii drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician  physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription 
furthermore  the amount of schedule ii substances we can obtain for clinical trials and commercial distribution is limited by the dea and our quota may not be sufficient to complete clinical trials or meet commercial demand 
there is a risk that dea regulations may interfere with the supply of the drugs used in our clinical trials  and in the future  our ability to produce and distribute our products in the volume needed to meet commercial demand 
conducting clinical trials of our product candidates exposes us to expensive product liability claims and we may not be able to maintain product liability insurance on reasonable terms or at all 
the risk of product liability is inherent in the testing of medical products 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or terminate testing of one or more of our products 
our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products 
we currently carry clinical trial insurance but do not carry product liability insurance 
we may not be able to obtain such insurance at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle us to indemnification against product liability losses  such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise 

table of contents our ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or an adequate level of reimbursement for our products from healthcare payers 
our ability to commercialize our drugs  alone or with collaborators  will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement will be available from government and health administration authorities  private health maintenance organizations and health insurers  and other healthcare payers 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products 
healthcare payers  including medicare  health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations  are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and or are seeking pharmacoeconomic data to justify formulary acceptance and reimbursement practices 
government and other healthcare payers increasingly are attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for drugs  and by refusing  in some cases  to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the fda has or has not granted labeling approval 
third party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any products we discover and develop  alone or with collaborators 
if government and other healthcare payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products  market acceptance of them could be limited 
law enforcement concerns over diversion of opioids and social issues around abuse of opioids may make the regulatory approval process very difficult for our drug candidates 
media stories regarding the diversion of opioids and other controlled substances are commonplace 
law enforcement agencies or regulatory agencies may apply policies that seek to limit the availability of opioids 
such efforts may adversely affect the regulatory approval process for our drug candidates 
our stock price has been volatile and could experience a sudden decline in value 
our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and may continue to experience volatility in the future 
you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our stock is not active or the volume is low 
the following factors  in addition to other risk factors described in this section  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or others  results of our preclinical and clinical trials  developments in patent or other proprietary rights by us or others  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by us or others  comments or opinions by securities analysts or major stockholders  future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders  regulatory developments or changes in regulatory guidance  litigation or threats of litigation  economic and other external factors or other disaster or crises  the departure of any of our officers  directors or key employees  period to period fluctuations in financial results  and limited daily trading volume 

table of contents volatility in the stock prices of other companies may contribute to volatility in our stock price 
the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
further  there has been particular volatility in the market prices of securities of early stage and development stage life sciences companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
the nasd and the securities and exchange commission have proposed certain new rules which  if adopted in their current form  may require us to make changes to the membership of our board of directors and audit and compensation committees 
if we were unable to continue to comply with the new rules within the time frame prescribed by the nasd  we could be delisted from trading on such market  and thereafter trading in our common stock  if any  would be conducted through the over the counter market or on the electronic bulletin board of the national association of securities dealers  inc as a consequence of such delisting  an investor would likely find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain quotations as to the price of  our common stock 
delisting of our common stock could also result in lower prices per share of our common stock than would otherwise prevail 
our share ownership is concentrated  and our officers  directors and principal stockholders can exert significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval 
due to their combined stock holdings  our officers  directors and principal shareholders shareholders holding greater than of our common stock acting collectively may have the ability to exercise significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
in addition  this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of the company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible to complete without the support of these shareholders 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and this fluctuation may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future 
factors contributing to these fluctuations include  among other items  the timing and enrollment rates of clinical trials for our product candidates  our need for clinical supplies and the re measurement of certain deferred stock compensation 
thus  quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not indicative of what we might expect in the future 
as a result  in some future quarters our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors which could result in a decline in the price of our stock 
business interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business 
our operations as well as those of our collaborators on which we depend are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses  human error  natural disasters  telecommunication failures  international acts of terror and similar events 
we have not established a formal disaster recovery plan and our back up operations and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses we may suffer 
a significant business interruption could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require us to cease or curtail our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates 
table of contents may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  government and non government debt securities and or money market funds that invest in such securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments  and as of december  all of our cash and cash equivalents were in money market and checking funds with variable  market rates of interest
