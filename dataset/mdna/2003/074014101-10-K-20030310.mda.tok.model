item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
the advertising rates that a radio station is able to charge and the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels largely determine those revenues 
advertising rates are primarily based on three factors a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  and the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time 
in  we generated of our revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual radio station s local sales staff 
we generated of our revenues from national advertising in  which is purchased through independent  national advertising sales representatives by customers that want to advertise nationwide 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from promotional events  brokered programming and sales to broadcasting networks that purchase commercial airtime 
our operations are divided into three reportable segments  radio group one  radio group two  and radio group three 
total assets  net revenue and other financial information for these segments are contained in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
we generally incur advertising and promotional expenses to increase listenership and arbitron ratings 
however  because arbitron reports ratings quarterly in most of our markets  any increased ratings  and therefore increased advertising revenues  tend to lag behind the incurrence of advertising and promotional spending 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services 
in order to maximize cash revenue from our inventory  we minimize our use of trade agreements and during the year ended december   barter revenue was million or of our net revenue and barter expenses were million or of our station operating expenses 
we calculate same station results by comparing the performance of radio stations owned or operated at the end of a relevant period to the performance of those same stations in the prior year s corresponding period  including the effect of barter revenues and expenses 
these results exclude two stations that were sold in the new orleans market during the first quarter of and one station that was sold in the new orleans market during the first quarter of in addition  for the comparison of to only  these results also exclude the operating results of wptp fm in the philadelphia market from january to october in and due to a major format change on november  we excluded the operating results of wptp fm because the implementation of this major format change resulted in a significant decrease in net revenue and a significant increase in promotional expenses during the period from january  to october   which were not comparable to the same period in under the previous format 
broadcast cash flow consists of net revenue less station operating expenses 
station operating expenses include program and production  sales and advertising  and station general and administrative expenses 
same station broadcast cash flow is the broadcast cash flow of the radio stations included in our same station 
table of contents calculations 
as you review the information contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should note that although broadcast cash flow and same station broadcast cash flow are not financial measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we believe that these measures are useful to an investor in evaluating our performance because we believe they reflect a measure of the performance of our radio stations before considering costs and expenses related to our specific corporate and capital structure including our corporate overhead  depreciation and amortization and interest expense 
in addition  we believe same station broadcast cash flow provides a useful measure of performance because it presents broadcast cash flow before the impact of any acquisitions or dispositions completed during the relevant periods which allows us to measure only the performance of radio stations that we have owned and operated for the entire relevant periods 
broadcast cash flow and same station broadcast cash flow are measures widely used in the broadcast industry to evaluate a radio company s operating performance and are used by management for internal budgeting purposes and to evaluate the performance of our radio stations 
however  you should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining our operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in addition  because broadcast cash flow and same station broadcast cash flow are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  they are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies restatement of financial information on february  we announced that we had restated our financial statements for the years ended december  and  and for the three months ended march  during the first quarter of  we recorded an adjustment to our deferred tax assets and deferred income tax expense as a result of the completion of our income tax returns 
however  during the fourth quarter of  it was determined that the adjustment should have been recorded in prior periods 
as restated  the adjustment corrects our deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded upon conversion from a series of subchapter s corporations  partnerships and limited liability companies to a subchapter c corporation at the time of our initial public offering of common stock on february  as a result of these restatements  the reported net loss for the year ended december  was decreased by  or per share  while deferred tax assets were increased by  and other receivables were increased by  for the year ended december   the reported net loss was increased by  or per share  while deferred tax assets and stockholders equity were increased by  for the three months ended march   the reported net loss was increased by  or per share 
these adjustments had no impact on operating income loss from continuing operations or other income expense as originally reported during  and  except for other non operating income for the year ended december  the following information presents the impact of these adjustments on the company s financial information as originally reported during  and

in march  we completed the sale of two radio stations in the new orleans market 
as of november   the purchaser began operating these stations under a time brokerage agreement until their disposition on march   which resulted in lower net revenue and station operating expenses during the year ended december  we also completed our barter agreements with etour  inc in may and findwhat 
com in october  both of which contributed to lower net revenue during the year ended december  in addition  we also completed our radio broadcast rights contract with the florida marlins in october 
table of contents on april   we began a one year extension to our radio broadcast rights contract with the florida marlins on more favorable terms for the season 
currently  we do not have a contract to broadcast the florida marlins during the season 
on october   we entered into a definitive agreement with abc  inc to sell wbyu am in the new orleans market for million  subject to certain adjustments 
on february   we completed the sale of wbyu am to abc  inc for million 
the proceeds from the sale were used to reduce the outstanding balance of the revolving credit loan under our credit facility 
upon completion of this sale we no longer have operations in the new orleans market  therefore the results of operations for wbyu am have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas implementation of this standard resulted in lower amortization expense for the year ended december  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  as of january   we tested our fcc broadcasting licenses  which were identified as intangible assets having indefinite useful lives  and goodwill for impairment 
to determine the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill  we obtained appraisals from an independent appraisal company 
as a result of the testing  we recognized an impairment of million related to fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill in the radio group three segment and recorded the loss as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the cumulative effect of the accounting change  net of income taxes  decreased net income million and earnings per share  of which million or per share is reported in discontinued operations

our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow and our credit facility 
our liquidity needs have been  and for the next twelve months and thereafter are expected to continue to be  for working capital  debt service  radio station acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures

purchase obligations include contracts for rating services  sports programming rights  and on air personalities 
other long term liabilities include the estimated fair value of three interest rate collar agreements and one interest rate swap agreement 
the estimated fair value of each agreement is based on the amounts we would expect to pay to terminate the agreement 
these amounts could become due and payable prior to the expiration of the agreements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions we consider reasonable at the time of making those estimates 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or using different assumptions 
we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers inability to make payments to us 
we review specific accounts by station  the current financial condition of our customers and historical write off experience when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances may be required 
we have recorded certain deferred tax assets  which we consider realizable due to the existence of certain deferred tax liabilities that are anticipated to reverse during similar future periods  however  we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets related to net operating losses in certain states 
if we were to determine that we would be unable to fully realize some or all of our remaining deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would be recorded as an expense in the period such determination was made 
we have significant amounts of property and equipment recorded in our financial statements 
we assess the recoverability of our property and equipment on an on going basis using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows that we expect to generate from these assets 
our radio stations operate in competitive markets and as such could experience adverse changes in listenership and cash flows 
these adverse changes may result in an impairment of our property and equipment in the future 

table of contents on january   we adopted sfas  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas to estimate the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill for our initial impairment test as of january   we obtained appraisals from an independent appraisal company 
subsequent estimates of fair value  whether by appraisal or management estimates of future discounted cash flows  may result in an impairment of our fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill in the future 
in addition  the use of different underlying assumptions by an appraisal company or management  such as determining future cash flows and discount rates  could result in materially different estimates of fair value and therefore could result in a material impairment of our fcc broadcasting licenses and goodwill

the interpretation also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees 
the interpretation requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the non contingent component of the guarantee  which is the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception 
the recognition of the liability is required even it is not probable that payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements 
as noted above  we have adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation and will apply the recognition and measurement provisions for all applicable guarantees entered into after december  to date  we have not entered into guarantees  which would require recognition and measurement pursuant to the provisions of the interpretation 
in december  fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas amends sfas to provide alternative 
table of contents methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas upon issuance with no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities the interpretation  which clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the interpretation is effective for variable interest entities created after january  at the present time  the adoption of the interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors our radio stations may not be able to compete effectively in their respective markets for advertising revenues  which could adversely affect our revenue and cash flow 
we operate in a highly competitive business 
a decline in our audience share or advertising rates in a particular market may cause a decline in the revenue and cash flow of our stations located in that market 
our radio stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues within their respective markets directly with other radio stations  as well as with other media 
these media include newspapers  magazines  network and cable television  outdoor advertising and direct mail and emerging media such as satellite radio 
our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings or advertising revenue and could incur increased promotional and other expenses if another radio station in a market were to convert its programming to a format similar to one of our stations  or if a new station were to adopt a comparable format or if an existing competitor were to improve its audience share 
other radio broadcasting companies may enter into markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we have 
our radio stations may not be able to maintain or increase their current audience ratings and advertising revenues 
a downturn in the performance of our miami ft 
lauderdale or philadelphia radio stations could adversely affect our revenue and broadcast cash flow 
a ratings decline or other operating difficulty in the performance of our radio stations in miami ft 
lauderdale or philadelphia could have a disproportionately adverse affect on our total revenue and broadcast cash flow 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net revenue and of our broadcast cash flow came from our radio stations in the miami ft 
lauderdale market 
for the same period approximately of our net revenue and of our broadcast cash flow came from our radio stations in the philadelphia market 
we have greater exposure to adverse events or conditions affecting the economy in these markets than would be the case if we were more geographically diverse 
we have substantial debt that could have important consequences to you 
we have debt that is substantial in relation to our stockholders equity 
as of december   we had long term debt of million and stockholders equity of million 
our long term debt is substantial in amount and could have an impact on you 
for example  it could 
table of contents require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for other purposes  including ongoing capital expenditures and future acquisitions  impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  limit our ability to compete  expand and make capital improvements  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns  limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and limit or prohibit our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions 
as of december   we had million in remaining commitments available under our credit facility  however  as of december  our maximum total leverage covenant would have limited additional borrowings to million 
our ability to reduce our total leverage ratio by increasing operating cash flow and or decreasing long term debt will determine how much  if any  of the remaining commitments under our credit facility will be available to us in the future 
poor financial results or unanticipated expenses could result in our failure to maintain or lower our total leverage ratio and we may not be permitted to make any additional borrowings under our credit facility 
moreover  we may need to modify or enter into a new credit facility to close on future acquisitions 
we also may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing for any of the following transactions the acquisition of radio stations  and or the full or partial redemption of our outstanding debt and or the payment of a dividend 
we have no assurances that we will be able to obtain other funding  additional financing or the approvals  if necessary  for any of these transactions 
any additional borrowings would further increase the amount of our debt and the associated risks 
the covenants in our credit facility restrict our financial and operational flexibility  which could have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
our credit facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to borrow  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  swap or sell assets  issue equity or merge or consolidate 
an event of default under our credit facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure the debt under our credit facility 
if the amounts outstanding under our credit facility were accelerated  the lenders could proceed against that collateral 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse affect on our business 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
a failure to meet these financial ratios could result in an event of default 
an event of default under our credit facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable 
we also may incur future debt obligations which might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility or subject us to other events of default 
the radio broadcasting industry faces many unpredictable business risks that could have a material adverse affect on our advertising revenues 
our future operations are subject to many business risks  including those risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse affect on our business including  but not limited to  shifts in population  demographics or audience tastes  the level of competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations  television stations and other entertainment and communication media  and 
table of contents changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the internal revenue service  united states department of justice  the federal trade commission and the federal communications commission 
in addition  we believe that advertising is a discretionary business expense  meaning that spending on advertising tends to decline disproportionately during economic recession or downturn as compared to other types of business spending 
consequently  a recession or downturn in the united states economy or the economy of an individual geographic market in which we own or operate radio stations would likely adversely affect our advertising revenues and  therefore  our results of operations 
we may not be successful in identifying  financing  consummating and integrating future acquisitions  an element of our business strategy  which could significantly impair our future growth 
radio broadcasting is a rapidly consolidating industry  with many companies seeking to consummate acquisitions and increase their market share 
if we are unable to identify and consummate future acquisitions in markets where we have the opportunity to purchase additional stations  our ability to compete in those markets could be impaired 
moreover  to the extent securities analysts and investors anticipate that we will continue to grow through acquisitions  and we do not do so  our stock price could decline  perhaps substantially 
we compete and will continue to compete with many other buyers for the acquisition of radio stations 
our acquisition strategy is subject to a number of risks  including competitors may be able to outbid us for acquisitions because they have greater financial resources  required regulatory approvals may result in unanticipated delays in completing acquisitions  we may not be successful in integrating acquisitions we may make  and we may be required to raise additional financing to consummate future acquisitions and that financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our chairman of the board and chief executive officer effectively controls beasley broadcast group  and members of his immediate family also own a substantial equity interest in beasley broadcast group 
their interests may conflict with yours 
george g 
beasley  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  generally is able to control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders 
without the approval of mr 
beasley  we will be unable to consummate transactions involving an actual or potential change in control  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over then current market prices 
shares of class b common stock  which mr 
beasley beneficially owns  represent approximately of the total voting power of all classes of our common stock 
mr 
beasley also has employee stock options  which are currently exercisable  to purchase  shares of class a common stock 
members of his immediate family also own significant amounts of class b common stock and  through employee stock options  class a common stock 
mr 
beasley will be able to direct our management and policies  except with respect to those matters requiring a class vote under the provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation  third amended and restated bylaws or applicable law 
historically  we have entered into significant transactions with george g 
beasley  members of his immediate family and affiliated entities 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
for example  prior to our initial public offering on february   beasley broadcast group owned a number of radio towers used in the operations of our stations 
these towers and related real estate assets were transferred to a company owned by george g 
beasley and members of his immediate family 
we currently lease these towers pursuant to twenty year leases and therefore these operating assets will not be under our direct control 
future related party transactions may not be on terms as favorable to us as could be obtained from unaffiliated parties 

table of contents our business depends on the efforts of key personnel and the loss of any one of them could have a material adverse affect on our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees  including george g 
beasley  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
mr 
beasley is years old 
we believe the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by mr 
beasley would be difficult to replace and that the loss of mr 
beasley s or other key executives expertise could impair our ability to execute our operating and acquisition strategies 
we may not remain competitive if we do not respond to the rapid change in technology  standards and services that characterize our industry 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services 
we may not have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
competition arising from new technologies or regulatory change may have a negative effect on the radio broadcasting industry or on our company 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approval for our acquisitions  our future growth may be impaired 
an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional radio stations 
we may not be able to complete all the acquisitions that we may agree to make 
radio station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
also  the fcc has interim procedures to review radio advertising concentration levels in proposed radio broadcasting transactions even if the proposed acquisition otherwise complies with the fcc s ownership limitations 
additionally  since the passage of the telecommunications act of  the justice department has become more involved in reviewing proposed acquisitions of radio stations and radio station networks 
the justice department is particularly concerned when the proposed buyer already owns one or more radio stations in the market of the station it is seeking to buy 
historically  the justice department has challenged a number of radio broadcasting transactions 
some of those challenges ultimately resulted in consent decrees requiring  among other things  divestitures of certain stations 
in general  the justice department has more closely scrutinized radio broadcasting acquisitions that result in local market shares in excess of of radio advertising revenue 
we are dependent on federally issued licenses to operate our radio stations and are subject to extensive federal regulation 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act 
we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our radio stations 
licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable 
although the vast majority of fcc radio station licenses are routinely renewed  we cannot assure you that the fcc will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications 
the non renewal  or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications  of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must comply with extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some radio stations 
the fcc also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations 
if the fcc relaxes these technical requirements  it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  these fcc regulations and others may change over time and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents future sales of our class a common stock could adversely affect its market price 
the market for our class a common stock could fall substantially if our stockholders who hold restricted shares of common stock sell large amounts of shares of class a common stock in the public market 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future 
it may be difficult to take over beasley broadcast group and that could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock 
george g 
beasley effectively controls the decision whether a change of control of beasley broadcast group will occur 
moreover  some provisions of our certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change of control could be beneficial to you 
in addition  the communications act and fcc rules and policies limit the number of stations that one individual or entity can own  directly or by attribution  in a market 
fcc approval for transfers of control of fcc licensees and assignments of fcc licenses are also required 
because of the limitations and restrictions imposed on us by these provisions and regulations  the trading price of our class a common stock could be adversely affected 
there may not be an active market for our class a common stock  making it difficult for you to sell your stock 
our stock may not be actively traded 
an illiquid market for our stock may result in price volatility and poor execution of buy and sell orders for investors 
our stock price and trading volume have fluctuated widely for a number of reasons  including some reasons that may be unrelated to our business or results of operations 
this market volatility could depress the price of our class a common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the market price of our class a common stock could decrease  perhaps significantly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facility 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility incur interest at the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus additional basis points depending on the outstanding principal balance under the credit facility 
as of december   million was outstanding under our credit facility 
we evaluate our exposure to interest rate risk by monitoring changes in interest rates in the market place 
to manage interest rate risk associated with our credit facility  we have entered into three interest rate collar agreements  one cap agreement  and one swap agreement 
under the collar agreements  our base libor cannot exceed the cap interest rate and our base libor cannot fall below our floor interest rate 
under the cap agreement  our base libor cannot exceed the cap interest rate 
under the swap agreement  we pay a fixed interest rate of and the other party pays us a variable amount based on libor 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts 
as of december  and  the aggregate notional amount upon maturity of these collar  cap and swap agreements was million and million  respectively 
our collar  cap and swap agreements as of december  are summarized in the following table agreement notional amount floor cap swap expiration date estimated fair value interest rate collar october interest rate cap may interest rate collar november interest rate collar november interest rate swap november
