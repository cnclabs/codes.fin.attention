her consists of music category management and distribution operations  principally in north america and the united kingdom uk 
nce encompasses the company s proprietary operations  which markets video titles on dvd and vhs formats 
business segment revenues discussed herein include intercompany sales which are eliminated in consolidation 
the company has determined that  as a category manager of music product wherein it coordinates freight service for product purchased by its customers with the assumption of risk effectively remaining with the company until its customers receive the product  it was appropriate to change its method for revenue recognition from recognition at the time of shipment to recognition upon delivery 
as a result of this change  product shipments during the last one to three days of a fiscal quarter will now be recognized as revenues in the next fiscal quarter 
in addition  the company  through its independent audit committee  has completed an internal review resulting from a formal sec investigation involving a subsidiary of the company 
the focus of the internal review involved the accounting treatment for two separate contracts with non music vendors negotiated by the subsidiary during the fiscal year ended april  fiscal  these contracts were approximately million each 
based on this internal review  the company has determined that these two contracts should have been reflected as financing transactions in its financial statements 
the company has also reclassified costs associated with acquiring and preparing inventory for distribution from selling  general and administrative expenses to direct product costs for the fiscal years ended april  fiscal and  to conform to the presentation adopted for the fiscal year ended may  fiscal

the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience and other various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates and assumptions described above 
the company believes that the following are its critical accounting policies recognition of revenues and future returns the company recognizes revenues upon delivery of product to customers fob destination 
as a category manager of music product  the company coordinates freight service for product purchased by its customers with the assumption of risk effectively remaining with the company until its customers receive the product 
customer inspection of merchandise is not a condition of the sale 
the company also manages product returns which includes both salable and non salable product  as well as damaged merchandise  and provides credits for such customer returns 
the company reduces revenues and direct product costs for estimated future returns at the time of revenue recognition 
the estimate for future returns includes both salable and non salable product 
on a quarterly basis  the company reviews the estimates for future returns and records adjustments as necessary 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on reported income before income taxes and minority interest 
deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes 
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  consideration is given to estimates of future taxable income  the character of income needed to realize future benefits and all available evidence 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
the company accounts for inventories using the full cost method which includes costs associated with acquiring and preparing inventory for distribution 
substantially all of the company s inventory is comprised of compact discs and audio cassettes which are not substandard from a functional standpoint 
typically  the company s suppliers offer return privileges for excess inventory quantities 
therefore  inventory reserves are provided for the risk that exists related to the carrying value of non returnable slow moving inventory that may exceed market value  although the effect of markdowns is minimized since the company s vendors offer some level of return allowances and price protection 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews the company s carrying value of inventory from a lower of cost or market perspective and makes any necessary carrying value adjustments 
acquired rights the company  principally in its proprietary products business  acquires rights to video licenses  giving it the exclusive privilege to manufacture and distribute such products 
the costs of acquired rights include advances paid to licensors and costs to create a master to be used for duplication 
the acquired rights are amortized based upon the sales volume method over a period which is the lesser of the terms of the agreements or the products estimated useful lives 
on a regular basis  the company performs analyses comparing the carrying values of its acquired rights with the expected future economic benefit of these assets 
based upon such analyses  the company adjusts  if necessary  the value of its acquired rights 
long lived assets at each balance sheet date  the company evaluates the carrying value and remaining estimated lives of long lived assets for potential impairment by considering several factors  including management s plans for future operations  recent operating results  market trends and other economic facts relating to the operation to which the assets apply 
recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of such assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets were deemed to be impaired as a result of this measurement  the impairment that would be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets
