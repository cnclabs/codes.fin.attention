item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
you should read this section in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
significant accounting policies are discussed in footnote to the consolidated financial statements  item inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
as such  materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operation and financial position include the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenues  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model

the minimum preferred return to be distributed to us by the joint venture during each of the years in the period ending december  is million per year 
we expect our aggregate return over the remaining term of the license agreement ending december  to be significantly in excess of this amount  although we cannot predict with certainty that expected levels of return will be achieved and  in any case  we anticipate substantial fluctuations in the amount of the preferred return distributed to us from year to year

quarterly fluctuations and seasonality we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate these fluctuations in the future 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
our first quarter is typically expected to be the least profitable as a result of lower net sales but substantially similar fixed operating expenses 
this is consistent with the performance of many companies in the toy industry

recent accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
the objective of sfas is to establish an accounting standard for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation on certain long lived assets 
the retirement obligation must be one that results from the acquisition  construction or normal operation of a long lived asset 
sfas requires the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset to be recognized at fair value as a liability when incurred  and the cost to be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
sfas will be effective for the company s fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of this statement will have no material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supersedes statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas and retains the 
table of contents basic requirements of sfas regarding when and how to measure an impairment loss 
sfas provides additional implementation guidance on accounting for an impairment loss 
sfas is effective for all fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted sfas beginning in fiscal  the adoption of which did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical correction sfas 
sfas eliminates extraordinary accounting treatment for reporting gains or losses on debt extinguishments  and amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the provisions of this sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after may   however  early application of sfas is encouraged 
debt extinguishments reported as extraordinary items prior to scheduled or early adoption of this sfas would be reclassified to other income in most cases following adoption 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas would have on its consolidated results of operations subject to the evaluation in accordance with apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which changes the accounting for costs such as lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity initiated after december  the standard requires companies to recognize the fair value of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the company anticipates that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

in october  we secured a syndicated line of credit totaling million with a consortium of banks led by bank of america  na line of credit 
the line of credit will be available for future acquisitions and working capital and is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and contains customary financial and non financial covenants which require us to maintain a minimum net worth and limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay cash dividends or make distributions  sell assets and enter into certain mergers or acquisitions 
we are required to not have any outstanding borrowings in excess of million for a period of at least consecutive days during the first fiscal quarter of each year of the agreement 
amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at plus the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  subject to adjustment based on certain financial ratios 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings 
in february  our board of directors approved a buyback of up to million of our common stock 
as of march   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for a total of approximately million 

table of contents we believe that our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand and the availability under the line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next months 
although operating activities are expected to provide cash  to the extent we grow significantly in the future  our operating and investing activities may use cash and  consequently  this growth may require us to obtain additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
exchange rates sales from our united states and hong kong operations are denominated in us dollars and our manufacturing costs are denominated in either us or hong kong dollars 
domestic sales from our united kingdom operations and operating expenses of all of our operations are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong kong dollar or british pound us dollar exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the united states and hong kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate fluctuations between the united states and hong kong and united kingdom currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or remain vulnerable to an economic downturn  such as china 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from companies in china  and  therefore  we are subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while we believe that  if such an event were to occur we would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at competitive prices  we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize our market risk 
interest rate risk as of december   we do not have any outstanding balances on our line of credit  and we have only nominal interest bearing obligations 
accordingly  we are not generally subject to any direct risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in hong kong and the united kingdom 
sales from our united states and hong kong operations are denominated in us dollars 
however  domestic sales from the united kingdom  purchases of inventory and operating expenses are typically denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong 
table of contents kong dollar or british pound us dollar exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we do not believe that near term changes in exchange rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows  and therefore  we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
with respect to the british pound  we will monitor its volatility frequently throughout the coming year 
while we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging  we may in the future use hedging programs to reduce financial market risks if it is determined that such hedging activities are appropriate to reduce risk 
we cannot assure you that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of these currencies
