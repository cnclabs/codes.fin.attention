item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general as of december   we operated o charley s restaurants in alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  kentucky  louisiana  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  ohio  south carolina  tennessee and virginia and operated six stoney river restaurants in georgia  illinois  kentucky and tennessee 
in addition  on january   we acquired ninety nine restaurant and pub 
as of january   there were ninety nine restaurant and pub restaurants in connecticut  maine  massachusetts  new hampshire  rhode island and vermont 
the financial results for the ninety nine concept will be included in our results of operations and financial condition beginning january  o charley s are casual dining restaurants that are intended to appeal to mainstream casual dining customers as well as upscale casual dining and value oriented customers by offering high quality  freshly prepared food at moderate prices with friendly and attentive customer service 
our growth strategy for the o charley s concept is to continue penetrating existing and new major metropolitan areas while opening new units in smaller secondary markets in close proximity to our metropolitan markets 
stoney river restaurants are upscale steakhouses that are intended to appeal to both upscale casual dining and fine dining customers by offering hand cut  premium mid western beef along with fresh seafood and other gourmet entrees with attentive service in a warm  friendly and relaxed environment 
our growth strategy for stoney river is to concentrate on major metropolitan markets in the southeast and midwest with disciplined  controlled development and the potential to accelerate development over the next several years 
total revenues for stoney river were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the loss before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for stoney river was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in  the company adopted sfas no 
and wrote off million of goodwill related to the stoney river acquisition completed in may of ninety nine are casual dining restaurants that have earned a reputation for providing high quality food at moderate prices in a comfortable  relaxed atmosphere 
the menu features a wide selection of appetizers  salads  sandwiches  burgers  entrees and desserts  all served in generous portions 
we plan to operate ninety nine as a stand alone concept  while providing strategic oversight and support 
our growth strategy for ninety nine  which is similar to the o charley s growth strategy  includes continuing to penetrate existing markets while adding new restaurants in the same general geographic areas where ninety nine currently operates 
we operate two commissaries for the primary purpose of providing our restaurants with consistent quality food products that meet our specifications while obtaining lower prices for those items through volume purchasing 
a substantial majority of the food products served in our o charley s and stoney river restaurants are distributed to the restaurants by our nashville commissary 
the commissary for ninety nine restaurant and pub distributes primarily the center of the plate items including red meat  poultry and seafood 
in addition to purchasing food and other non food products  the nashville commissary manufactures certain proprietary products and both of our commissaries cut red meat into steaks in usda approved and inspected facilities 
we believe our commissaries give us a competitive advantage in servicing our restaurants and a financial advantage 
we attribute the decreases in food cost as a percentage of our restaurant sales over the past four years  in part  to the operating leverage generated from the increased purchasing volumes and efficiencies achieved at our nashville commissary 
the following tables reflect changes in the number of restaurants we operated during the years presented o charley s restaurants in operation  beginning of year restaurants opened restaurants closed in operation  end of year stoney river restaurants in operation  beginning of year restaurants acquired restaurants opened in operation  end of year 
table of contents net earnings in and each were impacted by certain charges 
in  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as a result of our evaluation of the goodwill carrying value of the stoney river reporting unit 
we were required to perform this evaluation upon our adoption of sfas no 
 which dictates how companies must account for goodwill  and which we adopted on december  we determined the goodwill was impaired based upon our valuation of the fair value of the stoney river reporting unit and the fair value of its net assets  exclusive of goodwill 
the write off represented the total goodwill associated with the stoney river acquisition 
additionally  in accordance with sfas no 
 beginning in  we no longer amortize goodwill 
in  we incurred charges of approximately million  or approximately per diluted share  related to the closing of five stores 
these closings were the result of a comprehensive review of the past and expected performance of all locations  taking into consideration the difficult economic environment 
we closed one of the five restaurants in fiscal we closed three additional stores in fiscal we closed the fifth store during the first quarter of we are pursuing franchising our o charley s restaurant concept and expect to have our first franchise agreement in place in we will continue to incur certain legal and administrative expenses during the development stage of this program  which will not necessarily be offset by franchising revenue 
the establishment of franchising operations could have an adverse effect on our operating results until such time  if ever  as those operations begin to generate revenues in excess of their related expenses 
we anticipate approximately  in expenses for this program in fiscal revenues consist of restaurant sales and  to a lesser extent  commissary sales 
restaurant sales include food and beverage sales and are net of applicable state and local sales taxes 
commissary sales represent sales to outside parties consisting primarily of sales of o charley s branded food items  primarily salad dressings  to retail grocery chains  mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs 
cost of food and beverage primarily consists of the costs of beef  poultry  seafood  produce and alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages 
we believe our menus offer a broad selection of menu items and as a result there is not a high concentration of our food costs in any one product category 
the overall food cost environment has been positive during  which has had a positive effect on our earnings 
we believe food costs have benefited from the slowing economy and other factors 
although we currently believe there will be nominal food cost inflation in  there can be no assurance that favorable food costs trends will continue 
various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather  cause periodic fluctuations in food and other costs 
generally  temporary increases in these costs are not passed on to customers  however  we have in the past generally adjusted menu prices to compensate for increased costs of a more permanent nature 
payroll and benefits include payroll and related costs and expenses directly relating to restaurant level activities including restaurant management salaries and bonuses  hourly wages for restaurant level employees  payroll taxes  workers compensation  various health  life and dental insurance programs  vacation expense and sick pay 
we have an incentive bonus plan that compensates restaurant management for achieving and exceeding certain restaurant level financial targets and performance goals 
in  we have made improvements to the insurance benefits offered to our hourly employees 
the cost associated with these improvements is projected to be approximately million in fiscal this amount may vary from our estimate based upon a number of factors  including the number of employees that enroll in the new plan 
we believe these improvements will result in an increase to our payroll and related costs and expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales in restaurant operating costs include occupancy and other expenses at the restaurant level  except property and equipment depreciation and amortization 
supplies  rent  supervisory salaries  bonuses and related expenses  management training salaries  general liability and property insurance  property taxes  utilities  repairs and maintenance  outside services and credit card fees account for the major expenses in this category 

table of contents advertising  general and administrative expenses include all advertising and home office administrative functions that support the existing restaurant base and provide the infrastructure for future growth 
advertising  executive management and support staff salaries  bonuses and related expenses  data processing  legal and accounting expenses and office expenses account for the major expenses in this category 
depreciation and amortization primarily includes depreciation on property and equipment calculated on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life 
for periods prior to december   depreciation and amortization also includes amortization of goodwill  which related primarily to the acquisition of the stoney river concept 
in accordance with sfas no 
 beginning december   we no longer amortize goodwill 
preopening costs include operating costs and expenses incurred prior to a new restaurant opening 
our current practice of expensing preopening costs may cause fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on when those costs are incurred 
the amount of preopening costs incurred in any one year includes costs incurred during the year for restaurants opened and under development 
we incurred average preopening costs of approximately  for each new restaurant opened during

the following table reflects our operating results for   and as a percentage of total revenues unless otherwise indicated

see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for net earnings and earnings per share for fiscal and as if sfas no 
had been adopted at the beginning of fiscal 
table of contents fiscal year compared with fiscal year total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in primarily as a result of an increase in restaurant sales of million  or 
the increase in restaurant sales was attributable to the net addition of o charley s restaurants  three new stoney river restaurants opened in and a same store sales increase for the stoney river concept  partially offset by a same store sales decline at our o charley s restaurants 
our overall check average for the o charley s concept was in compared to in our guest traffic at our o charley s restaurants decreased approximately during fiscal during the second quarter of  we implemented a value menu promotion in response to the slowing economy  which lowered the price of certain entrees 
we believe this promotion generated positive guest traffic and lowered our average check in we believe our guest traffic was lower in  in part  as a result of not having a similar value promotion in during the third quarter of  we increased menu prices by approximately in approximately two thirds of our o charley s restaurants 
during the fourth quarter of  we introduced a new menu in all of our o charley s restaurants that included a menu price increase of approximately for the remaining one third of our stores that had not taken the menu price increase during the third quarter of we believe the increase in our check average is the result of the combination of the menu price increase taken in and the absence of a value promotion in similar to the one in additionally  we believe consumer spending patterns have vacillated due to the uncertain us economy and geopolitical environment  causing a negative effect on our guest traffic 
the increase in same store sales at our stoney river restaurants resulted from an increase in check average  partially offset by a decrease in guest traffic 
we expect that the uncertain us economy  the possible outbreak of war or other hostilities and adverse winter weather in many of our markets may adversely effect restaurant sales in cost of food and beverage in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  cost of food and beverage decreased to in from in we attribute the lower food cost percentage in primarily to an overall reduction in the cost of certain food items and continued improvements in operating efficiencies at our stores and commissary 
we experienced lower costs in red meat  pork  poultry and dairy costs  partially offset by increases in certain produce costs 
we anticipate a nominal increase in commodity prices in there can be no assurance that events outside of our control will not result in increases in food costs as a percentage of restaurant sales 
payroll and benefits increased million  or  to million in from million in payroll and benefits  as a percentage of restaurant sales  declined to in from in the slight decline was attributable to lower restaurant level bonuses and workers compensation expenses  offset by a modest increase in hourly wage rates and increased salaries for restaurant management in we have implemented improvements to the insurance benefits offered to our hourly employees for  and believe the cost associated with these improvements will be approximately million in this amount may vary based upon a number of factors  including the number of employees that enroll in the new plan 
we believe these improvements will result in an increase to our payroll and related costs and expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales in restaurant operating costs in increased million  or  to million from million in restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales  remained relatively flat at in compared to in  we experienced higher overall store occupancy and operating costs due primarily to increases in repair and maintenance cost  general liability insurance and credit card fees partially offset by lower utility costs compared to we also experienced a decrease in supervisory expenses in as a percentage of total restaurant sales due primarily to lower management training salaries 
we anticipate higher natural gas costs in due to increased usage as a result of lower average temperatures to date in compared to advertising  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of total revenues  advertising  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in advertising expenditures increased to million in from million in and  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in the increase in advertising expenditures was in response to the continued weakness of the us economy 
an increase in television costs represented the primary share of the overall increase in advertising expenditures 
stoney river restaurants rely primarily on word of mouth to attract new customers rather than media advertising 
general and administrative expenses increased 
table of contents to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased bonus expenses and integration costs associated with the acquisition of ninety nine partially offset by lower legal costs 
depreciation and amortization in increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization increased to in from in the increase in depreciation expense was primarily attributable to new restaurants opened in and capital expenditures for improvements to existing restaurants  which offset the lack of goodwill amortization in see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
pre opening costs in declined  or  to million from million in as a percentage of total revenues  pre opening costs declined to in from in the decrease in pre opening costs was primarily attributable to lower average cost per store opening this year versus last year 
income from operations increased million  or  to million in from million in excluding the effect of the asset impairment and exit costs recorded in  income from operations increased million  or in interest expense  net decreased million in to million from million in this decrease is the result of overall lower interest rates in the weighted average interest rate on our revolving credit facility decreased to in as compared with in due to lower short term libor rates in we anticipate higher interest expense in due to the increased borrowings incurred to finance the acquisition of ninety nine restaurant and pub coupled with higher average interest rates under our new credit facility 
earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for increased million  or  to million from million in excluding the effect of the asset impairment and exit costs recorded in  earnings before income taxes increased million  or  in income taxes for increased million  or  to million from million in this increase was primarily the result of the increase in earnings before income taxes 
our effective tax rate remained relatively flat at of pre tax earnings 
in  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as a result of our evaluation of the goodwill carrying value of the stoney river reporting unit 
the number of diluted weighted shares outstanding was million shares in  compared with million shares in this increase is attributable primarily to the effect of the sale of common shares in april and a higher number of dilutive stock options in fiscal year compared with fiscal year total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in primarily as a result of an increase in restaurant sales to million 
the increase in restaurant sales was attributable to the addition of new o charley s restaurants  the inclusion of the two original stoney river restaurants 
table of contents for the entire year following their acquisition in may  one new stoney river restaurant opened in  and an increase in same store sales at our o charley s restaurants of 
our overall check average for the o charley s concept was in and in the increases in revenue were partially offset by us having weeks of operations in as compared to weeks in in january  we increased menu prices at our o charley s restaurants by approximately 
we believe we realized the majority of that price increase during the first quarter of  but by the end of the first quarter  we began to see slowing consumer spending which resulted in a lower than expected check average 
in response to the slowing consumer spending patterns  we increased our marketing efforts and began to promote lower priced entrees and lowered certain daily entree specials 
as a result of this effort  we believe we maintained our increases in customer traffic but lowered our overall check average 
near the end of the third quarter of  we began to see increases in consumer spending which raised our check average but we continued to promote lower priced entrees through the end of cost of food and beverage in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  cost of food and beverage remained flat at in and although we experienced an increase in the cost of food and beverage in due to significantly higher cost for certain commodity food items  including red meat  dairy and baby back ribs  we continued to experience improved purchasing and operating efficiencies in our restaurants and commissary offsetting the higher commodity prices 
additionally  food cost were impacted by our stoney river restaurants in where the food costs are higher than o charley s due primarily to a higher percentage of red meat sales 
food costs were also impacted by the promotion of lower priced entrees in payroll and benefits increased million  or  to million in from million in payroll and benefits  as a percentage of restaurant sales  increased to in from in the increase was attributable to increasing salaries for restaurant management along with higher employee benefit costs  including workers compensation and health insurance costs in restaurant operating costs in increased million  or  to million from million in restaurant operating costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales  increased to in from in in  we experienced higher utility costs  primarily natural gas  and higher insurance expenses  primarily general and liquor liability insurance

asset impairment and exit costs were million during during the third quarter of  we made the decision to close five restaurants 
the decision followed a review of historical and projected cash flows of our stores in view of the difficult economic environment in which we were operating 
as a result of this decision  we recognized a 
table of contents charge during the third quarter of for asset impairment of approximately million and exit costs of approximately  primarily associated with certain related lease commitments 
pre opening costs in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of total revenues  pre opening costs increased to in from in this increase is attributable primarily to the cost incurred for the new o charley s restaurants in addition to higher pre opening costs incurred for the new stoney river restaurant

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash have historically been cash provided by operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  capitalized lease obligations and sales of our common stock 
our cash needs arise primarily from the purchase and development of new restaurants  equipment replacement  improvements to existing restaurants and the repayment of debt 
our working capital historically has had current liabilities in excess of current assets due to cash reinvestments in long term assets  mostly property and equipment additions  and does not indicate a lack of liquidity 
we expect to meet our obligations as they come due through available cash  internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at december   our working capital deficiency was million 
the total net increase in cash was million in 
table of contents net cash provided by operations was million in  million in  and million in other sources of cash in came from net borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility  million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and approximately million from the sale of assets 
additionally  we financed million in new restaurant equipment through capitalized lease obligations 
in  we received million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock 
in  we invested million in property and equipment expenditures  including million of equipment acquired under capital leases 
these expenditures were made primarily for new o charley s restaurants opened during the year  three new stoney river restaurants opened during the year  restaurants under construction at december   and improvements to existing restaurants and commissary facilities 
other primary uses of cash were million in principal payments on capitalized lease obligations and other long term debt 
the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility was million on december   an increase of approximately million from december  the credit facility required monthly interest payments at a floating rate based on the bank s prime rate plus or minus a certain percentage spread or the libor rate plus a certain percentage spread 
the interest rate spread basis points at december  was based on certain financial ratios and was recomputed quarterly 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the facility during was  as compared with during on december   the average interest rate on the outstanding balance of the facility was  as compared with at the end of from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swap agreements with certain financial institutions for the purpose of fixing the amount of interest we pay over a certain period of time at varying notional amounts 
at december   there were million in aggregate amounts of interest rate swap agreements outstanding that carried a weighted average interest rate of 
the effective amount of interest we pay on the notional amounts of these swap agreements is calculated using the interest rate of the swap plus the percentage spread on our revolving credit facility 
the swap agreements outstanding at december  expire as follows million in january  and million in january on january   we consummated the acquisition of ninety nine restaurant and pub for million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock  plus the assumption of certain liabilities of ninety nine 
of the stock portion of the purchase price  we delivered approximately  shares at closing  and will deliver approximately  shares on each of the first  second and third anniversaries of the closing and  shares on each of the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the closing 
in conjunction with the acquisition of ninety nine  we entered into a new million senior secured credit facility to fund the purchase price for ninety nine  repay our previous revolving credit facility and provide capital for future growth 
the new credit facility is comprised of a revolving credit facility with a maximum principal amount of million and a term loan in the original principal amount of million 
the revolving credit facility matures on january  and the term loan matures on january  the term loan provides for scheduled quarterly principal amortization of million commencing june  and ending march  and quarterly principal amortization of million commencing june   with a final payment of million due at maturity 
amounts outstanding under the new revolving credit facility bear interest  at the company s option  at either libor plus a specified margin ranging from to based on certain financial ratios or the base rate  which is the higher of the lender s prime rate and the federal funds rate plus  plus a specified margin ranging from to based on certain financial ratios 
amounts outstanding under the term loan bear interest  at the company s option  at either libor plus or the base rate plus 
at february   the effective interest rate was on the revolving credit facility and on the term loan 
our new credit facility imposes restrictions on us with respect to the incurrence of additional indebtedness  sales of assets  mergers  acquisitions  joint ventures  investments  repurchases of stock and the payment of dividends 
in addition  the credit facility requires us to comply with certain specified financial covenants  including covenants relating to maximum adjusted debt to ebitdar earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent ratio  maximum leverage  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum asset coverage ratio and minimum capital expenditures ratio 

table of contents during and  ninety nine restaurant and pub entered into a sale leaseback facility under which it sold properties and leased the properties back from the buyer 
the total proceeds from the transaction were million 
the future obligations under this facility are reflected under operating leases in the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table below 
we have budgeted approximately million to million in for capital expenditures for the planned to new o charley s restaurants  approximately ten new ninety nine restaurants  improvements to existing restaurants  approximately two new stoney river restaurants  expansion of our commissary facilities  and information systems improvements 
there can be no assurance that actual capital expenditures in will not vary significantly from budgeted amounts based upon a number of factors  including the timing of additional purchases of restaurant sites 
we intend to continue financing the furniture  fixtures and equipment for our new restaurants primarily with capitalized lease obligations 
on may   we purchased two existing stoney river legendary steaks restaurants and all associated trademarks and intellectual property for approximately million in cash 
the transaction includes an earn out provision for the benefit of the former owners of up to million at the end of  million at the end of  and million at the end of the potential earn out is based on the stoney river legendary steaks concept achieving certain performance thresholds income before taxes and pre opening costs for such year 
the performance thresholds were not satisfied as of the end of and  accordingly  no earnout was paid in in the event that these performance thresholds are met in future years  we would recognize an expense related to the earn out provision as all of the goodwill related to the acquisition has been written off 
based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe that available cash flow from operations  combined with the available borrowings under our new credit facility and capitalized lease arrangements  will be adequate to meet our anticipated future requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and scheduled payments under our new term loan facility through at least december we have historically produced sufficient cash flow from operations to supplement our capital needs each year 
our ability to meet our capital needs are highly dependent on us continuing to generate sufficient cash from operations and there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so 
we continually review our capital structure to determine the optimum structure to fund our operations and anticipated growth 
this may result in our repaying from time to time amounts outstanding under our credit facility through public or private issuances of debt or equity securities or through a sale leaseback of certain o charley s properties 
in addition  our growth strategy includes possible acquisitions or strategic joint ventures 
any acquisitions  joint ventures or other growth opportunities may require additional external financing 
there can be no assurances that such sources of financing will be available to us or that any such financing would not negatively impact our earnings

critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows property and equipment excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill impairment of long lived assets property and equipment as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line method over the following estimated useful lives building and improvements years  furniture  fixtures and equipment to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset s estimated useful life or the expected lease term 
equipment under capital leases is amortized to its expected value at the end of the lease term 
gains or losses are recognized upon the disposal of property and equipment  and the asset and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are expensed as incurred 
inherent in the policies regarding property and equipment are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including useful life  residual value to which the asset is depreciated  the expected value at the end of the lease term for equipment under capital leases  and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of assets 
these significant estimates and judgments  coupled with the fact that the ultimate useful life and economic value at the end of a lease are typically not known until the passage of time  through proper maintenance of the asset  or through continued development and maintenance of a given market in which a store operates can  under certain 
table of contents circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate depreciation and amortization or  in some cases result in a write down of the value of the assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see critical accounting policy impairment of long lived assets below 
we believe that our accounting policy for property and equipment provides a reasonably accurate means by which the costs associated with an asset are recognized in expense as the cash flows associated with the asset s use are realized 
excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  as of december   we no longer amortize goodwill 
beginning in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangibles 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we incurred an after tax charge of million  or per diluted share  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of fiscal associated with the adoption of ssfas no 
the charge was related to the goodwill associated with the stoney river acquisition 
on january   we acquired ninety nine restaurant and pub for million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock 
we are required to complete a valuation of the assets and liabilities of ninety nine and to allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities with the remaining amount being allocated to goodwill 
we anticipate that a substantial majority of the purchase price will be allocated to goodwill and trademarks  which we will be required to test for impairment under sfas no 
on an annual basis 
impairment of long lived assets as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the judgments made related to the ultimate expected useful life and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying value of an asset are affected by such issues as ongoing maintenance of the asset  continued development and sustenance of a given market within which a store operates  including the presence of traffic generating businesses in the area  and our ability to operate the store efficiently and effectively can cause us to realize an impairment charge 
we assess the projected cash flows and carrying values at the restaurant level  which is the level where identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the long lived assets associated with a restaurant may not be recoverable 
we believe that our accounting policy for impairment of long lived assets provides reasonable assurance that any assets that are impaired are written down to their fair value and a charge is taken in earnings on a timely basis 

table of contents other accounting matters as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we account for our stock option plans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas encourages all entities to adopt a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock compensation plans  whereby compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
however  sfas no 
also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost for those plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principle board opinion no 
apb  whereby compensation cost is the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock on the grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we currently apply the provisions of apb to account for our stock option plans 
stock options issued to date pursuant to our stock options plans have had no intrinsic value at the grant date  and under opinion no 
 no compensation cost is recognized for them 
we have provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements pro forma net earnings and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants made in and subsequent years as if the fair value based method defined in sfas had been applied 
as of december   we had options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock outstanding at an average exercise price of per share 
in january  we issued options to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock   of which were granted to the management of ninety nine restaurant and pub 
in the event that accounting rules associated with stock options were to change to require all entities to use the fair value based method of accounting prescribed by sfas no 
 or were we to voluntarily elect to apply such methods  our consolidated statement of earnings would be impacted

impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  equipment  land and construction costs could adversely affect our operations 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
as a result of increased competition and the low unemployment rates in the markets in which our restaurants are located  we have continued to increase wages and benefits in order to attract and retain management personnel and hourly employees 
in addition  most of our leases require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  repairs and utility costs  and these costs are subject to inflationary pressures 
we attempt to offset the effect of inflation through periodic menu price increases  economies of scale in purchasing and cost controls and efficiencies at our restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing  and cash management activities 
we currently utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of capitalized leases and our variable rate debt consists of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term loan 
as an additional method of managing our interest rate exposure on our credit facility  at certain times we enter into interest rate swap agreements whereby we agree to pay over the life of the swaps a fixed interest rate payment on a notional amount and in exchange we receive a floating rate payment calculated on the same amount over the same time period 
the fixed interest rates are dependent upon market levels at the time the swaps are consummated 
the floating interest rates are generally based on the monthly libor rate and rates are typically reset on a monthly basis  which is intended to coincide with the pricing adjustments on our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had in effect million in swaps at an average fixed rate of  million of which matures in january and million of which matures in january
