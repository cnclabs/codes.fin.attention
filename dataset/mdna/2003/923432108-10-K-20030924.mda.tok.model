from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company

the company s fiscal year is the or week period ending on the friday nearest to june fiscal  and each consisted of weeks 
overview verilink corporation the company provides telecommunications products that address the wireless infrastructure  voice and data integrated access  and wireline service delivery markets 
the company develops  manufactures  and markets integrated access devices  centralized access systems  and infrastructure service enabling equipment for network service providers  enterprise customers  and original equipment manufacturer oem partners

the company s customers include regional bell operating companies rbocs  interexchange carriers ixcs  incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs  competitive local exchange carriers clecs  international post  telephone  and telegraph ptt administrations  wireless service providers  equipment vendors  enterprise customers  and various local  state  and federal government agencies 
the company s performance in fiscal reflects the results of its efforts to respond to the unstable economic environment and downturn in the telecommunication industry that negatively impacted fiscal and beginning in the second of half of fiscal  the company focused on achieving a return to profitability and generating positive cash flow 
fiscal was the first year since fiscal that the company achieved income from operations 
additionally  fiscal was the first year since fiscal that the company achieved a year over year increase in net sales 
on january   the company acquired the netengine integrated access devices iads from polycom  inc the netengine family of iads and routers enable enterprise customers to access broadband and voice over broadband vob services 
netengine products support a wide range of broadband transmission standards and end user requirements  and are interoperable with the products of a variety of leading broadband equipment vendors 
on july   the company acquired the miniplex product line from terayon communication system  inc 
this product line gives telephone companies the capability of providing multiple plain old telephone services pots connections over a single copper pair a more cost effective alternative to resolving copper exhaust problems than the installation of new copper cable 
utilization of the miniplex product as a pair gain solution also saves companies the time and expense involved in the system turn up of a traditional digital loop carrier dlc system 
the majority of sales in fiscal continued to be provided by the company s legacy products  primarily the as product line that provided of net sales 
net sales of the wansuite product family decreased to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the company anticipates that net sales from legacy products will decline over the next several years  with significant quarterly fluctuations possible 
the company s results from operations have and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period in the future 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
results of operations sales fiscal year ended june  june  june  thousands net sales    percentage change from preceding year net sales for fiscal increased to  from net sales of  in fiscal the largest factor leading to this increase was the acquisition of the netengine product line that added sales of  from the acquisition date on january  to june  see acquisition of netengine product line below 
net sales of carrier and carrier access products  primarily as products  increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to the increase in sales to the company s largest customer  which can fluctuate based on the timing of its projects and demand from its customers 
shipments of the as product line in fiscal accounted for approximately of net sales compared to during fiscal and in fiscal enterprise access products  including netengine products  increased slightly to  in fiscal from  in fiscal excluding netengine sales  sales of enterprise access products decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  which we believe to be the lingering impact of both economic and industry wide factors  as well as the overall decline in demand for legacy products 
the company anticipates that the current reduced capital spending levels by our customers will continue to affect sales until an overall recovery in the telecommunications market begins  which is not expected to change in in any event  it remains challenging to forecast future revenue trends in the current environment 
net sales for fiscal decreased from fiscal to  and net sales in fiscal decreased from fiscal to  the company believes these decreases were attributable to reduced capital spending by our large telecommunication infrastructure and enterprise customers alike that began in fiscal due to economic and industry wide factors  including financial constraints affecting our customers and over capacity in our customers markets 
the company s business is characterized by a concentration of sales to a limited number of key customers 
sales to the company s top five customers accounted for  and of sales in fiscal   and  respectively 
the company s five largest customers in fiscal were alcatel  communication network services a division of british telecom  interlink communications systems  nortel networks and verizon  with nortel and interlink representing an aggregate of of the company s sales in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and factors affecting future results customer concentration 
the company sells its products primarily in the united states through a direct sales force and through a variety of resellers  including original equipment manufacturers  system integrators  value added resellers  and distributors 
sales to value added resellers and distributors accounted for approximately of sales in fiscal  as compared to approximately in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  direct sales outside of north america were not significant  but we expect international sales to increase due to the acquisition of the netengine products 
gross profit fiscal year ended june  june  june  thousands gross profit    percentage of sales gross profit  as a percentage of sales  in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in gross profit margin in fiscal year was attributable to a more favorable product sales mix  increased sales volume  and the benefit from cost reduction measures enacted during fiscal and  including productivity gains and lower fixed manufacturing and facilities costs  and the benefit from consolidation of manufacturing in madison  alabama from san jose  california 
additionally  the provision for excess and obsolete inventories decreased to  for fiscal as compared to  for fiscal due to excess inventories in fiscal as a result of the decline in sales 
the decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to less favorable product sales mix  additional excess and obsolete inventory reserves of  and approximately  related to severance costs and the impact to depreciation expense from the reduced lives of it assets associated with out sourcing activities 
in future periods  the company s gross profit will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the mix of products sold  the cost of products manufactured at subcontract facilities  the channels of distribution  the price of products sold  discounting practices  price competition  increases in material costs and changes in other components of cost of sales 
as the company introduces new products  it is possible that such products may have lower gross profit margins than other established products in high volume production 
accordingly  gross profit as a percentage of sales may vary 
research and development fiscal year ended june  june  june  thousands research and development    percentage of sales research and development r d expenses decreased to  or of sales in fiscal as compared to  or of sales in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to staff reductions in fiscal and fiscal in addition to other cost reduction measures implemented by the company in its efforts to return to profitability 
the decrease in r d expense in fiscal as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal was due to reduced spending on higher sales volume 
the decrease in spending and the decrease in r d as a percentage of sales in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the suspension of the optical network access development project in october and the impact of cost reduction measures that resulted in a decrease in other product development 
in october  the company terminated its agreements associated with the optical network access development project 
research and development expenditures in fiscal and related to the optical network access development project were  and  respectively 
see note capitalization  stock warrants and related agreements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the specific agreements related to this optical network access project 
the company considers product development expenditures to be important to future sales  and expects research and development expenditures to increase in fiscal there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will result in commercially successful new technology and products in the future  and those efforts may be affected by other factors as noted below 
see factors affecting future results dependence on legacy and recently introduced products and new product development 
selling  general and administrative fiscal year ended june  june  june  thousands selling  general and administrative    percentage of sales the company s selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to  or of sales in fiscal from  or of sales in fiscal the decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to reduced headcounts between the two years  accrued severance costs in fiscal  and other cost reduction measures implemented by the company from march until august the significant decrease as a percentage of sales was due to lower spending on increased sales dollars 
sg a decreased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal due primarily to reduced headcount between the two periods  lower variable sales compensation on lower sales volume and other cost reduction programs  offset by a charge for bad debts related to amounts outstanding from worldcom in june of approximately  the increase in sg a as a percentage of sales in fiscal was due to lower sales volume 
the company expects that sg a expenses will stabilize in fiscal and decrease as a percentage of sales with higher sales volumes 
in process research and development the in process research and development expense of  for fiscal was a non recurring charge for the acquisition costs of the netengine product line attributable to in process technologies

interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to net rental income related to property held for lease  offset by lower interest income on lower average investment balances during the year and lower interest rates 
rental income  net of expenses  was  in fiscal interest and other income  net decreased to  in fiscal from  in as a result of lower average invested cash and short term investment balances  an increase in early payment discounts taken by customers  and lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense declined to  for fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of lower interest rates and lower principal balances on the company s debt obligations 
interest expense increased in fiscal from  in fiscal due to the fact that interest payments were capitalized during the first six months of fiscal while the facility at explorer boulevard in huntsville  alabama was undergoing renovations 
provision for income taxes no tax provision or tax benefits were provided in fiscal due to the valuation allowance provided against the net change in deferred tax assets

the company s overall gross margins in future periods can be expected to decline as a result of the acquisition 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods might be based upon amounts that differ from those estimates 
the following represent what the company believes are among the critical accounting policies most affected by significant management estimates and judgments impairment of long lived assets and goodwill

s and  respectively 
the company s long lived assets include  but are not limited to  the property held for lease  furniture and equipment  software licenses  and goodwill and intangible assets related to acquisitions 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s long lived assets during fiscal  the company obtained a third party appraisal for the property held for lease  and made assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on june   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and completed the analysis of its goodwill for impairment 
the company recorded an impairment charge of  during the three months ended september   related to goodwill 
inventories 
the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
inventory quantities on hand are reviewed on a quarterly basis and a provision for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand for the next twelve months 
management s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may increase or decrease the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory in future periods 
inventory reserves totaled  and  as of june  and june   respectively 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes a sale when the product has been shipped  no material vendor or post contract support obligations remain outstanding  except as provided by a separate service agreement and collection of the resulting receivable is probable

the reserve for future product returns was  and  as of june  and june   respectively 
warranty provision 
the company records a warranty provision at the time of the sale based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future claims on products sold 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  actual product failure rates  material usage or other rework costs could differ from our estimates  which could result in revisions to our warranty liability  which totaled  and  as of june  and june   respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company estimates losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for amounts billed 
the collectability of outstanding invoices is continually assessed 
assumptions are made regarding the customer s ability and intent to pay  and are based on historical trends  general economic conditions and current customer data 
should our actual experience with respect to collections differ from these assessments  there could be adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which totaled  and  as of june  and june   respectively 
valuation of notes receivable 
the company continually assesses the collectability of assets classified as outstanding notes receivable 
assumptions are made regarding the counter party s ability and intent to pay and are based on historical trends and general economic conditions  and current data

the allowance for notes receivable was  and  as of june  and june   respectively 
deferred tax assets 
the company has provided a full valuation reserve related to its deferred tax assets 
in the future  if sufficient evidence of the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions becomes apparent  the company may be required to reduce its valuation allowances  resulting in income tax benefits in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for the valuation allowance each year 
the valuation allowance related to the company s deferred tax assets was  and  as of june  and june   respectively

the company has in the past experienced delays in the introduction of new products  product applications and enhancements due to a variety of internal factors  such as reallocation of priorities  difficulty in hiring sufficient qualified personnel and unforeseen technical obstacles  as well as changes in customer requirements 
such delays have deferred the receipt of revenue from the products involved 
if the company s products have performance  reliability or quality shortcomings  then the company may experience reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable and additional warranty and service expenses 
risks associated with acquisitions  potential acquisitions and joint ventures 
an important element of the company s strategy is to consider acquisition prospects and joint venture opportunities that could complement its existing product offerings  augment its market coverage  enhance its technological capabilities or offer revenue and profit growth opportunities 
as noted above  on january   the company acquired the net assets used in and directly relating to polycom  inc s line of netengine integrated access devices iads for up to  plus the assumption of service and warranty obligations for existing netengine customers as of the closing of the acquisition 
transactions of this nature by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  use of cash and or the incurring of debt and the assumption of contingent liabilities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results and or the price of the company s common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has limited or no prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
joint ventures entail risks such as potential conflicts of interest and disputes among the participants  difficulties in integrating technologies and personnel  and risks of entering new markets 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to successfully integrate the businesses  products  technologies or personnel acquired in the netengine acquisition or those of other entities that may be acquired in the future or to successfully develop any products or technologies that might be contemplated by any future joint venture or similar arrangement 
the failure of the company to integrate the netengine product line acquisition  the miniplex product line acquired in july or to integrate future potential acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
customer concentration 
a small number of customers have historically accounted for a majority of the company s sales  with nortel networks accounting for a majority of sales in fiscal see item business sales  marketing and customer support 
on a quarterly basis in fiscal  net sales to nortel networks of legacy products has accounted for as much as  and as little as  of the company s net sales in that particular quarter 
there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders with the company  that orders by existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods  or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
the economic climate and conditions in the telecommunication equipment industry are expected to remain unpredictable in fiscal  and possibly beyond 
worldcom  inc filed a bankruptcy petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code in july a bankruptcy filing by one or more of the company s other major customers could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future success will depend to a large extent on the continued contributions of its executive officers and key management  sales  and technical personnel 
the company is a party to agreements with its executive officers to help ensure the officer s continual service to the company in the event of a change in control 
each of the company s executive officers  and key management  sales and technical personnel would be difficult to replace 
the company implemented significant cost and staff reductions during fiscal  and  which may make it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers or key personnel  or the inability to attract qualified personnel  could delay product development cycles or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key suppliers and component availability 
the company generally relies upon contract manufacturers to buy finished goods for certain product families and component parts that are incorporated into board assemblies used in its products 
on time delivery of the company s products depends upon the availability of components and subsystems used in its products 
currently  the company and its third party sub contractors depend upon suppliers to manufacture  assemble and deliver components in a timely and satisfactory manner 
the company has historically obtained several components and licenses for certain embedded software from single or limited sources 
there can be no assurance that these suppliers will continue to be able and willing to meet the company and its third party sub contractors requirements for any such components 
the company and its third party sub contractors generally do not have any long term contracts with such suppliers  other than software vendors 
any significant interruption in the supply of  or degradation in the quality of  any such item could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
any loss in a key supplier  increase in required lead times  increase in prices of component parts  interruption in the supply of any of these components  or the inability of the company or its third party sub contractor to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of any of the company s outside contractors could cause a delay in the company s ability to fulfill orders while the company identifies a replacement contractor 
because the establishment of new manufacturing relationships involves numerous uncertainties  including those relating to payment terms  cost of manufacturing  adequacy of manufacturing capacity  quality control  and timeliness of delivery  the company is unable to predict whether such relationships would be on terms that the company regards as satisfactory 
any significant disruption in the company s relationships with its manufacturing sources would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
purchase orders from the company s customers frequently require delivery quickly after placement of the order 
as the company does not maintain significant component inventories  delay in shipment by a supplier could lead to lost sales 
the company uses internal forecasts to manage its general materials and components requirements 
lead times for materials and components may vary significantly  and depend on factors such as specific supplier performance  contract terms  and general market demand for components 
if orders vary from forecasts  the company may experience excess or inadequate inventory of certain materials and components  and suppliers may demand longer lead times  higher prices or termination of contracts 
from time to time  the company has experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in fulfillment of customer orders 
such shortages and allocations may occur in the future  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s sales are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors resulting in more variability and less predictability in the company s quarter to quarter sales and operating results 
for example  sales to nortel networks during fiscal varied between quarters by as much as million  and order volatility by this customer had an impact on the company in the current and prior fiscal years 
most of the company s sales are in the form of large orders with short delivery times 
the company s ability to affect and judge the timing of individual customer orders is limited 
the large fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter could be due to a wide variety of factors  such as delay  cancellation or acceleration of customer projects  and other factors discussed below 
the company s sales for a given quarter may depend to a significant degree upon planned product shipments to a single customer  often related to specific equipment or service deployment projects 
the company has experienced both acceleration and slowdown in orders related to such projects  causing changes in the sales level of a given quarter relative to both the preceding and subsequent quarters 
delays or lost sales can be caused by other factors beyond the company s control  including late deliveries by the third party subcontractors the company is using to outsource its manufacturing operations as well as by other vendors of components used in a customer s system  changes in implementation priorities  slower than anticipated growth in demand for the services that the company s products support and delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new services and products 
delays and lost sales have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
the company believes that sales in the past have been adversely impacted by merger activities by some of its top customers 
in addition  the company has experienced delays as a result of the need to modify its products to comply with unique customer specifications 
these and similar delays or lost sales could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see customer concentration and dependence on key suppliers and component availability 
the company s backlog at the beginning of each quarter typically is not sufficient to achieve expected sales for that quarter 
to achieve its sales objectives  the company is dependent upon obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter 
furthermore  the company s agreements with certain of its customers typically provide that they may change delivery schedules and cancel orders within specified timeframes  typically up to days prior to the scheduled shipment date  without significant penalty 
the company s customers have in the past built  and may in the future build  significant inventory in order to facilitate more rapid deployment of anticipated major projects or for other reasons 
decisions by such customers to reduce their inventory levels could lead to reductions in purchases from the company in certain periods 
these reductions  in turn  could cause fluctuations in the company s operating results and could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations in the periods in which the inventory is reduced 
operating results may also fluctuate due to a variety of factors  particularly delays in new product introductions by the company  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in the product or customer mix of sales  changes in the level of operating expenses  competitive pricing pressures  the gain or loss of significant customers  increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses associated with new product introductions  and general economic conditions 
all of the above factors are difficult for the company to forecast  and these or other factors can materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations regarding future sales and are fixed in the short term to a certain extent 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in sales 
any significant decline in demand relative to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  the company has had  and in some future quarter may have operating results below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
see potential volatility of stock price 
potential volatility of stock price 
the trading price of the company s common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general conditions in the telecommunication network access and equipment industries  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many technology companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
company specific factors or broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the company has experienced significant fluctuations in its stock price and share trading volume in the past and may continue to do so 
competition 
the market for telecommunications network access equipment addressed by the company s netengine  as  and wansuite product families can be characterized as highly competitive  with intensive equipment price pressure 
this market is subject to rapid technological change  wide ranging regulatory requirements  and the entrance of low cost manufacturers 
the market for the company s prism  isnp  and miniplex product lines can be characterized as declining with a small number of highly competitive firms 
the technology is not considered new and the market has experienced decline in recent years 
industry consolidation could lead to competition with fewer  but stronger competitors 
in addition  advanced termination products are emerging  which represent both new market opportunities  as well as a threat to the company s current products 
furthermore  basic line termination functions are increasingly being integrated by competitors  such as cisco  lucent technologies  inc and nortel networks  into other equipment such as routers and switches 
to the extent that current or potential competitors can expand their current offerings to include products that have functionality similar to the company s products and planned products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater technical  financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  many of the company s competitors have long established relationships with network service providers 
there can be no assurance that the company will have the financial resources  technical expertise  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
rapid technological change 
the network access and telecommunications equipment markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the rapid development of new technologies increases the risk that current or new competitors could develop products that would reduce the competitiveness of the company s products 
the company s success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to respond to changes in technology and customer requirements 
this will require the timely selection  development and marketing of new products and enhancements on a cost effective basis 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring high levels of innovation 
the company may need to supplement its internal expertise and resources with specialized expertise or intellectual property from third parties to develop new products 
the development of new products for the wan access market requires competence in the general areas of telephony  data networking  network management and wireless telephony as well as specific technologies such as dsl  isdn  frame relay  atm and ip 
furthermore  the communications industry is characterized by the need to design products that meet industry standards for safety  emissions and network interconnection 
with new and emerging technologies and service offerings from network service providers  such standards are often changing or unavailable 
as a result  there is a potential for product development delays due to the need for compliance with new or modified standards 
the introduction of new and enhanced products also requires that the company manage transitions from older products in order to minimize disruptions in customer orders  avoid excess inventory of old products and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer orders 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  introducing or managing the transition to new or enhanced products  or that any such products will be responsive to technological changes or will gain market acceptance 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if the company were to be unsuccessful  or to incur significant delays in developing and introducing such new products or enhancements 
see dependence on recently introduced products and new product development 
compliance with regulations and evolving industry standards 
the market for the company s products is characterized by the need to meet a significant number of communications regulations and standards  some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed 
in the united states  the company s products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and standards established by underwriters laboratories and bell communications research 
for some public carrier services  installed equipment does not fully comply with current industry standards  and this noncompliance must be addressed in the design of the company s products 
standards for new services such as frame relay  performance monitoring services and dsl have evolved  such as the g 
shdsl standard 
as standards continue to evolve  the company will be required to modify its products or develop and support new versions of its products 
the failure of the company s products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry standards could delay introduction of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with entry into international markets 
the company to date has had minimal direct sales to customers outside of north america 
the company has little experience in the international markets  but with the acquisition of the netengine products in january  intends to expand sales of its products outside of north america and to enter certain international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
conducting business outside of north america is subject to certain risks  including longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent any company sales are denominated in foreign currency  the company s sales and results of operations may also be directly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to sell its products internationally  the company must meet standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries  as well as recommendations of the consultative committee on international telegraph and telephony 
a delay in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  certification of its products in countries outside the united states could delay or preclude the company s marketing and sales efforts in such countries  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of third party claims of infringement 
the network access and telecommunications equipment industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company 
the company has not conducted a formal patent search relating to the technology used in its products  due in part to the high cost and limited benefits of a formal search 
in addition  since patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the related patent is issued and foreign patent applications generally are not publicly disclosed for at least a portion of the time that they are pending  applications may have been filed which  if issued as patents  could relate to the company s products 
software comprises a substantial portion of the technology in the company s products 
the scope of protection accorded to patents covering software related inventions is evolving and is subject to a degree of uncertainty which may increase the risk and cost to the company if the company discovers third party patents related to its software products or if such patents are asserted against the company in the future 
patents have been granted recently on fundamental technologies in software  and patents may be issued which relate to fundamental technologies incorporated into the company s products 
the company may receive communications from third parties asserting that the company s products infringe or may infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
in its distribution agreements  the company typically agrees to indemnify its customers for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in favor of the company  could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  the company might be required to discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses from third parties 
there can be no assurance that licenses from third parties would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim against the company and the failure of the company to develop or license a substitute technology  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
limited protection of intellectual property 
the company relies upon a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright  and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in its products and technologies 
the company has been issued certain us and canadian patents with respect to limited aspects of its single purpose network access technology 
the company has not obtained significant patent protection for its access system or wansuite technologies 
there can be no assurance that third parties have not or will not develop equivalent technologies or products without infringing the company s patents or that a court having jurisdiction over a dispute involving such patents would hold the company s patents valid  enforceable and infringed 
the company also typically enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with its employees and independent contractors  and non disclosure agreements with its suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of its proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these statutory and contractual arrangements will deter misappropriation of the company s technologies or discourage independent third party development of similar technologies 
in the event such arrangements are insufficient  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus  make the possibility of misappropriation of the company s technology and products more likely 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at june   the company s investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
additionally  the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and therefore  the company would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in income or cash flows 
the company invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
the company is subject to interest rate risks on its long term debt 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   the additional interest expense would not be material 
the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material
