overview general 
hines is one of the largest commercial green goods operations in north america  producing one of the broadest assortments of container grown plants in the industry 
the company sells its green goods products primarily to the retail segment  which includes premium independent garden centers  as well as leading home centers and mass merchandisers  such as home depot  lowe s  wal mart and target 
seasonality 
the company s green goods business  like that of its competitors  is highly seasonal 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant variability in net sales  operating income and net income on a quarterly basis 
acquisitions 
in the three years ended december   the company completed  in connection with its green goods business  two acquisitions in  both of which have been accounted for under the purchase method 
accordingly  the purchase prices were allocated to certain assets and liabilities based on their respective fair market values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of the net assets acquired relating to each transaction was accounted for as goodwill 
beginning january   goodwill will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to a periodic test for impairment as discussed below in critical accounting policies 
tax matters 
the company derives significant benefits under the us federal tax code by qualifying to use the cash method of accounting for federal income tax purposes 
under the cash method  sales are included in taxable income when payments are received and expenses are deducted as they are paid 
the primary benefit the company receives is the ability to deduct the cost of inventory as it is incurred 
if the company s ability to use the cash method of accounting for federal income tax purposes was limited or eliminated  the company s cash income tax payments could increase significantly 
as a result of the company s ability to deduct its growing costs under the farming exception  the company has historically not been required to pay cash income taxes and has generated net operating losses for federal income tax purposes 
at december   the company had approximately million in net operating loss nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
as a result of the sale of the sun gro business  the company estimates that it will utilize approximately million of these net operating loss carryforwards in for federal income tax purposes 
because of this nol utilization and the company s projections of future earnings  the company anticipates it will begin paying cash income taxes for federal purposes in the company is currently paying cash income taxes for state income tax purposes in certain states due to the differing rules regarding the carryforward of net operating losses 
at december   the company has a current liability for deferred income taxes of million 
because the majority of the items to which this liability relates are comprised of current assets and current liabilities in the balance sheet such as inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable  etc  this deferred tax item is also characterized as current 
the classification of this liability as a current item does not mean that it will be paid within the next year 
recent developments on february   the board of directors accepted the resignation of stephen p 
thigpen as chairman and ceo and appointed douglas d 
allen as chairman and robert a 
ferguson as chief operating officer 
pursuant to his employment agreement with the company  dated as of august   the company made a lump sum cash payment to mr 
thigpen of two times his annual base salary totaling million which will be recorded as compensation expense in the three months ending march  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the following areas represent its most critical accounting policies related to actual results that may vary from those estimates 
revenue recognition hines records revenue  net of sales discounts and allowances  when all of the following have occurred  an agreement of sale exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
sales returns and allowances amounts accrued for sales returns and allowance are maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses in the trade receivable due to sales discounts and allowances 
the provision rate is established by management using the following criteria past sales returns experience  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the rate is re evaluated on a quarterly basis 
provisions for sales discounts and allowances charged against income increase the allowance 
the company records revenue  net of sales discounts and allowances  when the risk of ownership is transferred to the customer 
allowances are provided at the time revenue is recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for bad debts is maintained at a level believed by management to adequately reflect the probable losses in the trade receivable due to customer defaults  insolvencies or bankruptcies 
the provision is established by management using the following criteria customer credit history  customer current credit rating and other relevant factors 
the provision is re evaluated on a quarterly basis 
provisions to bad debt expense charged against income increase the allowance 
all recoveries on trade receivables previously charged off are credited to the accounts receivable recovery account charged against income  while direct charge offs of trade receivables are deducted from the allowance 
accounting for goodwill impairment on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

in accordance with this standard  goodwill has been classified as indefinite lived assets no longer subject to amortization 
indefinite lived assets are subject to impairment testing upon adoption of sfas no 
and at least annually thereafter 
in accordance with sfas no 
 this involves a two step process 
first  the company must determine if the carrying amount of equity exceeds the fair value based upon the quoted market price of the company s common stock 
if the company determines that goodwill may be impaired  the company compares the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas no 
 to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
the initial impairment analysis was completed in the fourth quarter of the company recorded a one time  non cash charge of million  net of tax  to reduce the carrying value of its goodwill 
the company has recognized this impairment charge as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
accrued liabilities the accrued liabilities include amounts accrued for expected claims costs relating to the company s insurance programs for workers compensation and auto liability 
the company has large deductibles for these lines of insurance  which means it must pay the portion of each claim that falls below the deductible amount 
the company s expected claims costs are based on an actuarial analysis that considers the company s current payroll and automobile profile  recent claims history  insurance industry loss development factors and the deductible amounts 
the company accrues its expected claims costs for each year on a ratable monthly basis with a corresponding charge against income 
management reviews the adequacy of the accruals at the end of each quarter 
the accruals for the expected costs relating to the company s insurance programs for workers compensation and auto liability are maintained at levels believed by management to adequately reflect the company s probable claims obligations 
results of operations the following discussion reflects only the results of operations from continuing operations of the green goods business 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales of million for the fiscal year ended december  increased million  or  from net sales of million for the comparable period in the increase was due primarily to increased sales volume resulting from strong sales generated by the company s west coast operations  successful in store service programs in the northeast markets and strong sales of perennials 
sales generated by the company s west coast operations were strong because of product line changes  while increased sales in the northeast were driven by the expansion of successful in store service programs 
these programs enable us to offer a broader selection of green goods and streamline ordering and in store merchandising activities with our customers 
this was somewhat offset by sluggish sales in arizona  texas and the southeast  which resulted primarily from overcapacity of green goods in the market 
in addition  given kmart s uncertain financial situation  the company reduced its sales to the large retailer for the year ended december  by approximately million from the previous year 
the company s management believes that the trend of overcapacity in the market is likely to continue until the retail lawn and garden channels can effectively absorb the sales volume formerly serviced by kmart 
gross profit 
gross profit of million for the year ended december  decreased million  or  from million for the comparable period in as a percent of net sales  gross margins decreased to from mainly due to the lower sales in our southeast markets  which typically carry higher margins  and increased scrap rates primarily related to the lower kmart sales and higher unit production costs in the nursery operations 
selling and distribution expenses 
selling and distribution expenses of million for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily attributable to the higher sales  additional sales and merchandising personnel and higher distribution costs 
distribution costs increased by million  or  from due mainly to the company s transition to a unitized delivery mode for many of its nursery products 
the company anticipates that the distribution costs related to this unitized delivery mode will remain at a consistent level in future years 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million for the comparable period in the change was due mainly to an increase in bad debt expense relating to the kmart pre chapter receivable  higher costs associated with the company s continued implementation of its oracle system and severance costs associated with the elimination of certain administrative positions somewhat offset by the reduction in salary costs related to the elimination of these positions 
other operating income 
other operating income of million for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily due to the net gain from the sale of the company s property in hillsboro  oregon and the gain on sale of fixed assets  partially offset by the write off of software the company no longer uses 
amortization of goodwill goodwill amortization for the year ended december  of decreased million  or  from million for the comparable period in the decrease was entirely due to the adoption of sfas no 
 which discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
operating income 
operating income of million for the year ended december  decreased million  or  from million for the comparable period in as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased to from

other expenses 
other expenses of million for the year ended december  decreased million  or  from million for the comparable period in the decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest expenses and a mark to market charge of million relating to the company s million interest rate swap agreement as compared to a charge of million for the comparable period in this adjustment results from the quarterly change in the swap s valuation  which is based on long term interest rate expectations 
interest expense was million lower in  which resulted from using the net proceeds from the sale of the sun gro business and the sale of the oregon land to reduce debt

as discussed above 
loss income from discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  includes a loss of million  net of tax  from the sale of the sun gro business and a gain of million from the operations of sun gro through the date of sale 
the loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  is comprised entirely of a loss from the operations of sun gro 
extraordinary item 
the extraordinary item of million  net of tax  represents the write off of unamortized financing costs resulting from the early extinguishment of debt which occurred as a result of using the net proceeds received from the sale of the sun gro business to pay down outstanding debt before its maturity 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million for the year ended december  represents the goodwill impairment charge  net of tax  resulting from the company s adoption of sfas no 
the company valued both the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as of january  the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the book value goodwill led to a pre tax charge of million 
a million tax benefit was recorded in connection with the loss 
our measurement of the fair value of the goodwill was based on the market capitalization of the company s common stock over a reasonable period of time  including a control premium 
accordingly  the primary factor contributing to the impairment charge was the overall deterioration in the company s stock price and the company s substantial leverage 
net loss income 
the net loss of million for the year ended december  decreased million from net income of million for the comparable period in the decrease was primarily due to the loss from discontinued operations  extraordinary item and the goodwill impairment charge discussed above

other operating income 
other operating income of million for the year ended december  represents the net gain from the sale of fixed assets 
no such sales occurred in amortization of goodwill goodwill amortization for the year ended december  of million increased million  or  from million for the comparable period in the increase was primarily due to the acquisitions in having an entire year of amortization expense in operating income 
operating income of million for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million for the comparable period in primarily as a result of the higher sales 
as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased to from due primarily to a decrease in gross margins and higher total operating expenses as described above 
other expenses 
other expenses of million for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million for the comparable period in the increase was due to higher interest expenses  increased amortization of deferred financing expenses and a mark to market charge of million relating to the company s million interest rate swap agreement

management had not previously provided for deferred taxes due to their belief that the investment in sun gro canada was previously expected to be permanent in nature 
net loss income 
net income of million for the year ended december  decreased million  or  from million for the comparable period in the decrease was primarily due to lower gross margins  higher operating expenses  increased interest expenses and the loss from discontinued operations as described above 
liquidity and capital resources on march   the company completed the sale of the sun gro business and received net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  the company completed the sale of acres of land located in hillsboro  oregon in march  and received net proceeds of approximately million 
the company used million of the aggregate proceeds from the sale of the sun gro business and the sale of the oregon land to reduce long term debt with the remaining amount of million used to reduce the amount outstanding under its working capital revolver 
consequently  the company s net debt position short term and long term debt at december  was million compared to net debt of million at december   which included long term debt from its discontinued operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable period in mainly due to increased cash generated from working capital changes and lower interest costs 
the improvement in working capital was mainly due to an improvement in days sales outstanding and lower inventory volume growth 
this was somewhat offset by a smaller increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities compared to the same period in the smaller increase was expected because the company obtained extended payment terms from a significant number of vendors at the beginning of  which caused a one time improvement in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the period 
the seasonal nature of the company s operations results in a significant increase in certain components of working capital primarily accounts receivable and inventory during the growing and selling cycles 
as a result  operating activities during the first and fourth quarters use significant amounts of cash  and in contrast  operating activities for the second and third quarters generate substantial cash as the company ships inventory and collects accounts receivable

the company s capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million 
the company typically draws under its revolving credit facilities in the first and fourth quarters to fund its seasonal inventory buildup of green goods products and seasonal operating expenses 
approximately of the company s sales occur in the first half of the year  generally allowing the company to reduce borrowings under its revolving credit facilities in the second and third quarters 
on march   the company had unused borrowing capacity of million under its million working capital revolver facility and had no unused borrowing capacity under its million seasonal revolver facility that can only be utilized between february and june the company s primary sources of liquidity are funds generated by operations and borrowings under its amended senior credit facility as amended  which matures on december  as of december   this facility is comprised of a million working capital revolver  a million seasonal revolving loan commitment  which can only be utilized for the period between february and june  a new term loan in the amount of million and a tranche b term loan in the amount of million 
borrowings under the amended senior credit facility are secured by substantially all the company s assets 
the amended senior credit facility places various restrictions on the company  including  but not limited to  limitations on the company s ability to incur additional debt  limitations on capital expenditures and limitations on dividends the company can pay to shareholders 
the amended senior credit facility requires the company to meet specific covenants and financial ratios 
at the company s option  the interest rate on the loans under the amended senior credit facility may be base rate loans  which is the higher of the prime rate or the rate which is of in excess of the federal funds effective rate  or eurodollar rate loans 
effective march   the company obtained a fourth amendment to its amended senior credit facility to i allow the company to add back to ebitda for and specific charges related to certain one time events for purposes of its financial covenants that establish minimum ebitda levels  minimum interest coverage ratios  and maximum leverage ratios  and ii allow the company to add back to ebitda fees and expenses associated with the fourth amendment

base rate loans under the seasonal working capital revolver bear interest at the base rate plus and under the tranche b term loan at the base rate plus an additional amount between and  depending on the company s consolidated leverage ratio

the warrant is exercisable at any time prior to december  if mdcp is required to make any payment with respect to its guarantee on the seasonal revolving loan commitment  the company would be required to issue to mdcp an additional warrant to purchase a number of shares of the company s common stock equal to the amount of such payment divided by the then current market price of the company s common stock 
in addition  hines nurseries the issuer of the notes and our wholly owned subsidiary has outstanding million of senior subordinated notes the notes due october of the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the issuer s obligations under the notes and the notes are redeemable  in whole or in part  at the option of the company  on or after october  at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest  if any  to the date of redemption 
the notes contain an embedded derivative in the form of a put option whereby the holder has the right to put the instrument back to the company at if a change in control of the company should occur 
this put option will be marked to market quarterly and any effect will be shown in the statement of operations 
the company does not anticipate that the derivative will have significant value because no change of control is currently contemplated 
the notes currently bear interest at per annum  and the indenture pursuant to which the notes were issued imposes a number of restrictions on our operating subsidiaries  including their ability to incur additional indebtedness  to make certain restricted payments including dividends to the company  to make certain asset dispositions  to incur additional liens and to enter into significant transactions 
a breach of a material term of the indenture for the notes or other material indebtedness that results in the acceleration of the indebtedness under the notes also constitutes an event of default under the amended senior credit facility 
in addition  the company is obligated to pay a premium at maturity equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repaid 
the company is accreting this premium over the term of the maturity of the notes as additional interest expense 
at december   the amount of the premium was million and  based on the million of notes outstanding  is expected to be million upon maturity 
at december   the company had the following contractual obligations payments due by period  in millions payments due by period less than contractual cash obligations total year years years after years tranche b term loan new term loan senior subordinated notes other obligations operating leases total hines does not have any off balance sheet financing or any financial arrangements with any related parties  except for operating leases  which are disclosed under note to the consolidated financial statements 
in our opinion  cash generated by operations and from borrowings available under the amended senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements through a total of million will become due under the senior credit facility during the senior credit facility requires the company to maintain compliance with various financial covenants 
failure to comply with any of the covenants of the senior credit facility during would require the company to seek waivers or an amendment to the senior credit facility 
the company has been successful in negotiating amendments to its bank agreements  including the amendment to the senior credit facility  effective march  if the company is unable to obtain such waivers  all debt under the senior credit facility would become due and payable at december  
the company was in compliance with these covenants during and  based upon management s operating plan  expects to remain in compliance with these covenants during actual results of operations will depend on numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot ensure that the company will comply with its financial covenants during if this occurs  management believes that it will be able to successfully renegotiate its covenants to ensure compliance throughout a total of million will become due under the senior credit facility during the company expects to refinance this debt with existing financial institutions or others  or extend its maturity prior to maturity 
there can be no assurance that management will be successful in refinancing this debt or extending its maturity 
forward looking statements and risk factors we have made and will make forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in our annual report  forms k and q and in other contexts relating to our future prospects  our operations and our strategies 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  information regarding our future economic performance and financial condition  the plans and objectives of our management and our assumptions regarding our performance and these plans and objectives 
the forward looking statements that we make in our annual report  forms k and q and in other contexts represent challenging goals for our company  and the achievement of these goals and our operations are subject to a variety of risks and assumptions and numerous factors beyond our control 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make are described below 
the following risk factors should not be considered a definitive list of all risks associated with our operations and should be read in conjunction with the risks and uncertainties contained in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
weather  general agricultural risks adverse weather or production difficulties occurring at a time of peak production or sales in the first half of the calendar year  particularly on weekends during the peak gardening season  could cause declines in net sales and operating income that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s operations may also be adversely affected by disease  freezing conditions  snow  drought or other inclement weather 
there can be no assurance that future weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
agricultural production is highly dependent upon the availability of water 
the company s facilities receive their water from a variety of sources  including on site wells  reservoirs and holding ponds  municipal water districts and irrigation water supplied to local districts by facilities owned and operated by the united states acting through the department of interior bureau of reclamation 
the loss or reduction of access to water at any of the company s facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company 
irvine land lease the company s acre nursery facility and headquarters in irvine  california is entirely on leased land 
the lease on the majority of the acreage does not expire until december  however  the lessor of the irvine land has the option to terminate the lease on two specific parcels at an earlier date 
the lessor has exercised this option and has provided written notice to the company that it must vacate a acre parcel by september  and must vacate an additional acre parcel by august  the company is actively pursuing an extension of these exit timelines with the lessor in order to allow the company the time necessary to transition the product that is grown on this acreage to other facilities 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining these extensions 
the failure of the company to obtain these extensions could cause declines in net sales and operating income that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
sudden oak death sudden oak death sod is caused by a fungus like pathogen recently identified by university of california scientists and named phytophthora ramorum 
since its appearance in  sod has killed tens of thousands of coast live oak  black oak  tan oak and shreve oak in northern california 
it can also infect leaves and branches of rhododendron  buckeye  madrone  manzanita  bigleaf maple  bay laurel and evergreen huckleberry 
most recently  both saplings of redwood and douglas fir trees have been found to be susceptible 
to date  sod has been identified in california counties and has been confirmed in a small town in southwest oregon 
restrictive regulation of soil media containing redwood and or douglas fir sawdust by the us department of agriculture or california department of forest agriculture could cause declines in net sales and operating income that could have a material adverse effect on the company given that our california nursery operations utilize soil media containing redwood and or douglas fir sawdust 
at this point in time  it is not clear how the usda cdfa will regulate soil media 
currently  there is no scientific data that indicates that p 
ramorum is present in sawdust  but redwoods and douglas firs are on the host list as discussed above 
we are currently undergoing studies growing plants in alternatives to redwood and or douglas fir sawdust 
we are also working closely with local  state and federal researchers on an effective treatment for p 
ramorum in a nursery operation 
there is no clearly understood or accepted treatment for wide scale infection of this disease at this time nor is it known how this disease is spread 
seasonality  variability of quarterly results and certain changes the company s business  like that of its competitors  is highly seasonal 
in  approximately of net sales and approximately of operating profits occurred in the first half of the year  with approximately of net sales and approximately of operating profits occurring in the second quarter of the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant variability in net sales  operating income and net income on a quarterly basis 
the principal factor contributing to this variability is weather  particularly on weekends during the peak gardening season  which could cause declines in net sales and operating income that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
other factors that may contribute to this variability include weather conditions during peak growing and gardening seasons  shifts in demand for live plant products  changes in product mix  service levels and pricing by the company and its competitors  the effect of acquisitions  the economic stability of the retail customers  and the company s relationship with each of its retail customers 
customer concentration  dependence on home depot our top customers together accounted for approximately of our fiscal year net sales 
our largest customer  home depot  accounted for approximately of our fiscal year net sales 
these customers hold significant positions in the retail lawn and garden market 
management expects that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of the company s net sales for the foreseeable future 
the company does not have long term contracts with any of its retail customers  and there can be no assurance that they will continue to purchase its products

at december  the carrying amount and estimated fair value of the company s long term debt was million and million  respectively 
given the company s balance of fixed rate and variable rate debt  we estimate a change in interest costs of approximately million for every one percentage point change in applicable interest rates
