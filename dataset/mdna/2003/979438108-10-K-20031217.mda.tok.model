item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations  and we develop  manufacture and market electronic and industrial communications products  primarily serving the global automation and control markets with connectivity solutions and specialty electrical products 
through our industrial communications and connectivity segment connectivity segment  or connectivity we provide the industrial automation industry with a single  worldwide source for industrial communications and connectivity solutions 
our product lines  comprising five recognized industry leading brands  brad harrison  mpm  sst  applicom and rj lnxx make us the premier supplier of application specific connectivity solutions 
our electrical safety specialty segment electrical segment  or electrical manufactures highly customized products to support enhanced safety and productivity on the factory floor 
our electrical product brands include daniel wood head and aero motive 
we sell our products to stocking distributors  original equipment manufacturers oem and system integrators 
our direct sales force  as well as manufacturers agencies  service our customers and promote our products to end customers 
we have operations in nine countries outside the united states  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our results of operations and financial condition 
sales our sales increased in fiscal compared to sales declined year over year and in fiscal years and  respectively 
sales activity in started to show improvement from the adverse economic conditions that have affected the us and international manufacturing environments since total revenues for fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal this increase was due to the sales results in our connectivity segment 
connectivity segment sales were million in  a increase from fiscal the increase was due mainly to favorable exchange rates million gain when compared to and the improved performance in our european operations  primarily in the physical media and din product lines 
connectivity sales accounted for of total revenue in and in electrical segment sales were million in  a decrease from fiscal this decrease was due mainly to the sale of our akapp operation  which accounted for million of revenue in electrical sales accounted for of total sales in and in sales volume in compared to was also negatively impacted by slightly lower selling prices less than  which resulted from competitive market pressures 
sales activity in continued to reflect the adverse economic conditions in the us and international manufacturing environments that began in in particular  the lack of capital investment by the industrial marketplace coupled with a severe decline in the telecom and datacom sectors resulted in the lower sales 
while we saw a small pick up in orders during the february to may period  as the year progressed  it became clear that the economy was not going to recover as most economists and industry experts had initially predicted 
the decline in volume was in part offset by increases in sales dollars due to changes in foreign exchange rates  primarily as the euro strengthened and the full year impact of sales from our applicom subsidiary acquired in february of these two factors benefited sales by compared to connectivity segment sales in were million and declined from with telecom datacom sales down 
connectivity sales accounted for of total sales in and in although the electrical segment benefited from mro maintenance  repair  operation sales and a government hose reel order in the fourth quarter  its sales declined from to million 
selling prices declined in by less than principally due to competitive pressure in all areas  but more in the telecom and datacom sectors than others 
sales by region sales to customers in the united states were million in  million in and million in fiscal sales to customers outside the us were million in  million in and million in european sales increased in fiscal due mainly to changes in the euro exchange rate 
this increase was partially offset by the revenue lost from the sale of our akapp subsidiary 
sales in to customers in canada and the far east increased by and  respectively 
the increase in canada was due mainly to the favorable exchange effects from the strengthening of the canadian dollar 
in european sales declined after benefiting from the strengthening euro and the full year of applicom sales 
in sales in canada and the far east declined by and  respectively when compared to we collected  and of our revenue in foreign currencies during  and  respectively 
backlog the backlog of unfilled orders stood at million  million and million at the end of  and  respectively 
the connectivity segment backlog as compared to the prior year was up 
the electrical segment recorded a increase in total backlog when compared to fiscal this increase was due mainly to a large government order received in the fourth quarter at our aero motive subsidiary 
gross profit in  gross profit as a percent of sales increased to from in this increase was due mainly to improved efficiencies and productivity improvements  particularly from the migration of production to our juarez  mexico facility  which occurred in and early also contributing to this increase in the gross profit level was a million decrease in obsolescence expense 
partially offsetting these improvements were lower pricing  the shift in sales mix by location and lower margins in the telecommunications market 
in gross profit declined to from in this decline was attributable primarily to lower plant utilization throughout the business 
during the year lower sales volume in both business segments  coupled with the significant reduction in our inventory levels from were the principal drivers of the lower plant utilization 
also  during our new plant in mexico came on line and we incurred initial startup costs and expenses to migrate production from our plant in northbrook  illinois 
in addition  we incurred startup costs to initiate production of fiber optic products in our uk facility 
as a result of declining volumes due to adverse economic conditions in the us and international markets  we needed to increase our reserve for excess obsolete inventory 
this increased expense by million from million in to million in the lower inventory levels in resulted in a reduction of the li fo reserve requirement  which favorably impacted our gross profit by million compared to operating expenses operating expenses as a percent of sales were in  in and in while operating expense as a percent of sales decreased in  the actual expenses increased to million in from million in the dollar increase was due mainly to the million restructuring charge for the migration of our operations from our aero motive subsidiary to juarez  mexico 
the aero motive restructuring will continue into with anticipated costs estimated to be million for the year 
in addition  related to the aero motive restructuring  we anticipate a pension settlement charge estimated to be approximately million in triggered by reduced employment levels that require us to recognize past gains and losses in our pension plan accounts 
also contributing to the increase in operating expenses in was the million effect of foreign exchange rate changes and the upgrading in the sales  marketing and engineering areas 
partially offsetting these increases were the million credit to operating expense due to the modification of our retiree medical program  the non recurrence of a restructuring charge for million to account for severance and related costs to eliminate approximately of our salaried positions worldwide in and the elimination of akapp operating expenses  which were million 
while operating expenses as a percent of sales increased in compared to  the actual expenses declined to million in from million in in we adopted fasb  which required us to stop amortizing goodwill 
this reduced expenses by million in in the second quarter of we incurred a million restructuring charge for severance and related costs associated with personnel reductions 
during we continued to reduce spending in our operations to offset the decline in sales revenue 
this was a process that was started in early when we first saw economic conditions deteriorate in our primary markets 
the savings achieved in and were partially offset by the full year impact of operating expenses at applicom acquired in april segment operating income income from operations in our connectivity segment increased to million or of sales in from million or of sales in this increase was due mainly to higher sales  lower obsolescence expense and favorable exchange rates 
a shift in sales mix and the weak telecommunications market partially offset these improvements 
income from operations in our electrical segment declined to million or of sales from million or of sales in the decrease in our electrical segment was due mainly to the million restructuring charge for the aero motive actions in and the million of income from operations eliminated as a result of the akapp sale 
income from operations in our connectivity segment declined to million or of sales in from million or of sales in lower operating expenses were unable to offset the impact of lower plant utilization  increases in excess obsolescence expense  the restructuring charge and the decline in sales volume 
income from operations in our electrical segment was and of sales in and  respectively 
the decline in was a result of reduced sales volumes and lower plant utilization 
interest income expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in primarily for interest paid on our long term debt incurred in connection with the mpm and sst acquisitions in the increase in interest expense in compared to was due to million of interest paid on a value added tax ruling in mexico 
during we incurred interest expense on loans under our bank revolving credit agreements to temporarily finance the applicom acquisition 
interest income was earned on short term deposits of operating cash 
other income expense other income expense in was million compared to million in the income consisted mainly of a million gain realized from exchange rate changes on a us dollar loan that our canadian subsidiary used to acquire the assets of sst in early also included in was the million gain from the sale of the aero motive workstation product line and million of expense related to an adverse value added tax ruling in mexico 
other income expense in was million compared to million in the year to year change was due primarily to the million write off of the investment in symphony systems in income from continuing operations income from continuing operations was million or of net sales in  million or of net sales in and million or of net sales in the increase in income from continuing operations when compared to was due mainly to the gain from exchange rate changes on the us dollar loan that our canadian subsidiary has outstanding  improved operating efficiencies  and the sale of the aero motive workstation product line 
the increases were partially offset by the aero motive restructuring charge that occurred in fiscal income from continuing operations decreased in compared to due mainly to lower productivity associated with the decreased sales levels in also contributing to the decrease was the restructuring charge of million to account for severance and related costs to eliminate of our salaried positions worldwide in discontinued operations in the first fiscal quarter of we sold our akapp operations for million in cash 
this sale resulted in a gain of million and was recorded as income from discontinued operations 
the results of operations related to akapp for fiscal were also recorded as income from discontinued operations 
net income net income was million or of net sales in  million or of sales in and million or of net sales in the increase in net income when compared to was due to the increase in income from continuing operations  specifically the positive exchange rate changes  improved efficiencies and the aero motive product line sale  and income generated from the akapp sale 
our effective tax rate was in  in and in in the income tax rate was close to the us federal statutory rate 
in the lower level of profitability combined with certain items not deductible in europe resulted in the higher effective tax rate 
for we could not tax effect the million write off of our investment in symphony systems and this increased our effective tax rate 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources assets at fiscal year end we had million in cash and short term investments  up from million at the end of the increase in our cash balance was due principally to our strong operating cash flow of million  the million of cash received from the sale of our akapp operations and the million in cash generated from the aero motive product line sale 
operating cash flows of million decreased from million in this decrease was due to the million reduction in inventory in compared to a million reduction in working capital in increased to million from million in this increase in working capital was due mainly to the increased profit levels that were generated in also contributing to the increase in working capital were the favorable exchange rate effects on our foreign assets and the decreased spending on capital expenditures that occurred in we continued to invest in property  plant and equipment  including new machinery  computer systems and facility improvements 
purchases of property  plant and equipment were million in compared to million in in we spent million to complete a second manufacturing facility in juarez  mexico 
our cash and short term investments are available for strategic investments  acquisitions  and other potential cash needs that may arise 
we believe that existing cash and short term investments  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements in liabilities at fiscal year end we had million of long term debt outstanding million shown as current debt  and we had unused credit facilities that provide for additional borrowings of up to million 
effective march   we amended our credit agreement with a bank to increase the maximum ratio of debt to ebitda  as defined  from to  and reduce the minimum interest coverage ratio  as defined  from to this amendment expired on march   when the maximum debt to ebitda ratio reverted back to and the minimum interest coverage ratio reverted back to we are in compliance with all of our funding arrangements 
additional information on debt covenants can be found in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash flows net cash flow provided by operating activities was million in  down from million in and million in the decrease in operating cash flow was due to a smaller reduction in inventory and increases in prepaid expenses 
the increase in prepaid expense was due to a million contribution to the pension plan 
the improvement in operating cash flow compared to was due to reductions in inventory and accounts receivable balances partially offset by declines in accrued expenses and net income 
in cash flows from investing activities included million of capital additions and cash received of million from the sale of akapp operations 
in we invested million on capital additions  of which million was used to finish the second juarez plant 
in fiscal  we made an investment of million in symphony systems  which represented less than of symphony s equity  which we accounted for under the cost method 
during  symphony systems was attempting to raise additional funds for future operations 
when symphony systems failed to raise additional funds  and was unable to sell the company  we felt that the fair value of this equity investment had declined to zero and this decline was other than temporary 
consequently  we wrote off the entire investment in fiscal subsequently  symphony systems made an assignment for the benefit of creditors in march as a result of this assignment  we received nothing for our equity interest 
net cash used for financing activities in  and represent the repayment of debt in the amounts of million  million and million  respectively  and dividend payments to our shareholders of million  million and million  respectively 
financial instruments in our global operating activities  and in the normal course of our business  we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we seek to minimize those risks through our regular operating activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of financial instruments 
we use financial instruments to selectively hedge our foreign currency risk and do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes 
additional details on our foreign exchange exposures can be found in note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contingent liabilities and environmental matters our operations are subject to international  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
we are party to an environmental matter  which obligates us to investigate  remediate or mitigate the effects on the environment of the release of certain substances at one of our manufacturing facilities 
it is possible that this matter could affect cash flows and results of operations 
additional details on the environmental exposure can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for the business include revenue recognition  valuation of long lived assets  accounting for contingent liabilities and environmental matters and accounting for income taxes 
there were no material changes made to critical accounting estimates compared to prior years 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon transfer of title at the time of shipment or services provided  when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
at the end of we had million accrued for warranty costs  sales returns  sales incentives  price adjustments and other allowances based on prior claims experience and other quantitative and qualitative factors 
no single customer accounted for more than of revenue 
valuation of long lived assets our long lived assets include land  buildings  equipment  molds and dies  purchased software  goodwill and other intangible assets 
long lived assets  other than goodwill  are depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
we review long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
fair values are estimated based upon forecasted cash flows discounted to present value 
the fair value of our long lived assets is dependent on the future performance of individual operations as well as volatility inherent in their external markets 
if estimated forecasts are not met and actual cash flows or discount rate estimates change  we may have to rec ord an impairment charge not previously recognized 
we currently have million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet 
no impairment charges were recorded in either or accounting for contingent liabilities and environmental matters we have incurred and expect to incur  assessment  remediation and related costs at one of our facilities for the costs of cleaning up contamination resulting from past spills  disposal or other releases of hazardous substances 
we have been conducting an investigation of soil and groundwater at the site with oversight by the michigan department of environmental quality deq 
we estimate that a minimum of approximately million of investigation and remediation expense remain to be incurred over the next years 
we have a reserve for such purpose 
our cost estimates are subject to uncertainty because of the extent of the contamination area  changes in remediation technology and ongoing deq feedback 
we may incur significant additional assessment  remediation and related costs at the site and such costs could materially and adversely affect our consolidated net income for the period in which such costs are incurred 
accounting for income taxes sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we have on our balance sheet net deferred tax assets of million 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these tax consequences could impact our financial position or the results of operations 
forward looking statements the securities and exchange commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information  so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects  and make informed investment decisions 
this report  and other written and oral statements that we make from time to time  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements set out anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
we have tried  wherever possible  to identify such statements by using words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  plan  believe  and words and terms of similar substance  in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
we cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties  and inaccurate assumptions 
in particular  such risks include statements relating to future actions  prospective products  future performance or results of current or anticipated products  sales efforts  expenses  the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings  general economic and business conditions  currency fluctuations  and competition 
international based revenues and substantial international assets result in our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we continue to evaluate the economic and operational impact of all foreign currencies  including its impact on competition  pricing  and foreign currency exchange risks 
there is no guarantee  however  that all problems have been foreseen and corrected  or that no material disruption will occur in our businesses 
growth in costs and expenses  changes in product mix  and the impact of acquisitions  restructuring  divestitures and other unusual items  that could result from evolving business strategies  could affect future results 
changes in the us tax code and the tax laws in other countries can affect our net earnings 
claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries for various legal  environmental  and tax matters  and additional claims arise from time to time 
it is possible that our cash flows and results of operations could be affected by the resolution of these matters 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements 
this discussion of potential risks and uncertainties is by no means complete but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact our outlook 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise
