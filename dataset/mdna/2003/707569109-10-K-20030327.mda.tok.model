hollywood casino owns and operates distinctively themed casino entertainment facilities in major gaming markets in aurora  il  tunica  ms and shreveport  la 
as a result of the acquisition  we believe we will be the seventh largest gaming company in the us based on gaming revenues

critical accounting estimates financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting estimates that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition in accordance with common industry practice  our casino revenues are the net of gaming wins less losses 
racing revenues include our share of pari mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers  our share of wagering from import and export simulcasting and our share of wagering from our otws 
the vast majority of wagers for both businesses are in the form of cash and we do not grant credit to our customers to a significant extent 
our receivables consist principally of amounts due from simulcasting of our races to other racetracks and their otws 
we also have receivables due under our management contract with casino rama for management fees and for expenses  primarily salaries and wages  payable in accordance with our contract 
historically  we have not experienced any significant bad debts from uncollected receivables 
valuation of long lived tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill as a result of our acquisitions of the mississippi properties in and crc in  intangible assets and goodwill increased significantly 
two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and ii the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in connection with these acquisitions  a valuation was completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices 
upon completion of the valuation process  approximately million was allocated to goodwill and million to the management service contract 
the management service contract is amortizable under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
because our goodwill is no longer amortized  there may be more volatility in reported income than under previous accounting standards because impairment losses  if any  are likely to occur irregularly in varying amounts 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgments as to the remaining useful lives of the assets purchased and present value computations for the management service contract 
if growth rates  operating margins  or useful lives  among other assumptions  differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require an acceleration in amortization expense of the management service contract 
at december   we had a net property and equipment balance of million  representing of total assets 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
future events such as property expansions  new competition and new regulations  could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring changes in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realizability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
litigation  claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events  as well as assumptions about future events 
if our assessment of such a matter should change  we may have to change the estimate  which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates

and the stock held by hwcc louisiana  inc the indentures governing the hollywood shreveport notes require the issuers to make an offer to purchase the hollywood shreveport notes at of the principal amount thereof within days of the occurrence of a change of control as defined in the indentures 
a change of control was deemed to have occurred under the indentures on march  as a result of the consummation of the merger of our wholly owned subsidiary with and into hollywood casino corporation 
hollywood casino shreveport determined that it does not have the liquidity to repurchase the hollywood shreveport notes at of their principal amount and  accordingly  could not make an offer to purchase the hollywood shreveport notes as required under the indentures 
on march   hollywood casino shreveport and shreveport capital corporation were notified by an ad hoc committee of holders of the hollywood shreveport notes that they have days from receipt of the notice to cure the failure to offer to purchase the hollywood shreveport notes or an event of default will have occurred under the indentures

we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
our future operating performance and our ability to service or refinance our debt will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control
