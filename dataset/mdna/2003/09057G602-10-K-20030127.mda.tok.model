statements looking forward in time are included in this annual report pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results in future periods to be materially different from any future performance suggested herein 
overview we are a regional clinical laboratory with focused market testing capabilities 
as a regional laboratory  we service the new york metropolitan area  and currently do business in most new york state counties  as well as in most of new jersey and some parts of pennsylvania and connecticut 
as a regional laboratory  we primarily offer laboratory services to physician offices in these areas with an infrastructure that includes a comprehensive logistical department  extensive phlebotomy services and phlebotomy draw stations scattered around our geographic area 
we have also developed expertise in certain focused testing areas with specific emphasis in cancer pathology and diagnostics as well as molecular diagnostics 
these services are marketed as a business unit  called genpath  which services customers outside of routine physician office testing 
we have developed certain specialized markets  such as in the areas of correctional health  substance abuse testing  fertility testing and molecular diagnostics 
testing in these areas also may be supported outside of physician offices 
during the last few years  the fundamentals of the industry have been improving 
in the cost containment era of the s  the industry was negatively impacted by the rapid growth of managed care  stringent government regulation and investigations into fraud and abuse 
these factors led to revenue and profit declines and industry consolidations  especially among commercial clinical laboratories 
as a result  fewer but larger clinical laboratories have emerged with greater economies of scale  more effective compliance with government billing regulation and other laws and a better approach to pricing their services 
these changes resulted in improved profitability 
in addition  new and emerging technologies continue to provide greater testing opportunities for clinical laboratories 
our psimedica business unit is a clinical knowledge management ckm system that uses data derived from various disparate sources to provide both administrative and clinical analysis of a population 
the source data consists of enrollment demographic data  claims data  pharmacy data  laboratory results data  and any other data that may be available 
the system uses sophisticated algorithms to cleanse and configure the data so that analysis can be comprehensive and meaningful 
the data is maintained on multiple levels of analysis enabling review of data from the global level to the granular transactional detail 
the system includes a base set of queries that provide basic functionality and allows on line real time ad hoc query capability enabling the user to customize analysis to the best needs of the organization using the system 
in addition to the basic queries provided by the system  psimedica quality indicators pqi provide comprehensive  disease state oriented queries that disclose the quality and efficiency of the care and service 
these indicators have been designed to provide the customer with standards and outcome predictors based on a medical standards basis 
we are using psimedica to market value added clinical laboratory services to bulk purchasers of clinical laboratory solutions  as well as marketing our psimedica programs to businesses such as health plans  integrated delivery networks  disease management companies  insurers  clinical trial companies and other healthcare providers that most benefit from the ability of the system to combine both clinical and administrative analysis 
careevolve  our wholly owned subsidiary  is a physician based connectivity portal 
this system provides a complex  sophisticated system for ordering laboratory services and delivering laboratory results 
the system is designed to be physician centric and to provide a highly flexible  scalable  comprehensive desktop solution for physicians to manage their day to day practice and personal needs  as well as to handle their clinical laboratory ordering and reporting 
this product has been designed to work as a platform with plug and play capability that can easily be used by other laboratories that also need a web based solution for their physician customers 
we have entered into a strategic marketing agreement with roche diagnostics to operate a joint venture for the sale and distribution of careevolve services to other laboratories throughout the country 
under the terms of the strategic marketing agreement  roche supports the marketing of careevolve to clinical laboratories through its extensive diagnostic marketing force and underwrites all expenses for the careevolve joint venture operation 
the joint venture is managed by a steering committee that consists of executives from both companies 
roche holds an option exercisable to purchase up to a equity interest in this wholly owned subsidiary 
to date  neither our psimedica business unit nor careevolve has produced significant revenues 
during fiscal  in addition to operating our physician based connectivity portal business through our wholly owned careevolve subsidiary careevolve  we also operated a health food products manufacturing business through our wholly owned right body foods subsidiary  rbf 
see item herein as to our termination of the health food business during the fourth quarter of fiscal and our write off of the remaining health food business assets during such quarter 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while many aspects of our business are subject to complex federal  state and local regulations  the accounting for our business is generally straightforward 
our revenues are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low dollar transactions  and about of all our costs consist of employee compensation and benefits 
revenues are recognized at the time the services are performed and are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered including prospectively determined adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third party payors 
these adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined 
these estimates are reviewed and adjusted  if warranted  by senior management on a monthly basis 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are correct  however  several factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed under cautionary statements as well as elsewhere herein including our failure to integrate newly acquired businesses if any and the cost related to such integration 
our failure to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners  or a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers 
adverse results from investigations of clinical laboratories by the government  which may include significant monetary damages and or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under  or future changes in  the law or regulations of clia  or those of medicare  medicaid or other federal  state or local agencies 
future changes in federal  state  local and third party payor regulations or policies or in the interpretation of current regulations affecting governmental and third party reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing 
failure to comply with the federal occupational safety and health administration requirements and the recently passed needlestick safety and prevention act 
failure to comply with hipaa  which could result in significant fines as well as substantial criminal penalties 
changes in payor mix 
failure to maintain our days sales outstanding levels 
increased competition  including price competition 
our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 
adverse litigation results 
we utilize diluted earnings per share eps on pre tax income as a performance indicator rather than the traditional eps calculation on an after tax basis 
this pre tax eps takes out the nuance of tax differences caused by large net operating loss carryforwards which create benefits which we used in the past and tax expense which we expect in the future 
the table below shows our pre tax eps on a diluted quarterly and annual basis for fiscal years and fiscal year fy fy results of operations fiscal year compared to net revenues net revenues for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   this represents a increase in net revenues 
this increase is due to a increase in patients serviced and a increase in net revenue per patient 
our laboratory operations had net revenues of  in fiscal the number of patients serviced during the year ended october  was  which was greater when compared to the prior fiscal year s twelve month period 
this increase is attributable to a net increase of four new sales representatives and our ongoing marketing efforts during the current fiscal year

this increase was caused primarily by three factors  an increase in marketing related expense of  an increase in bad debt of  and an increase in computer related expense of  all of which are attributable to the company s growth 
in addition  business insurance increased  and we expect a substantial increase in this expense category in fiscal year during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we terminated the health food business operations and sold the remaining assets for a nominal sum 
during such quarter  we recorded a write off of approximately  representing the remaining net book value of the intangible and other deferred assets attributable to the health food business 
interest expense interest expense decreased from  during the year ended october  to  during the year ended october   a decrease of  this decrease is due to a decline in the variable interest rates associated with the pnc line of credit utilized by the company 
management believes that this trend will not continue in the future due to the continued use of our revolving line of credit to fund our expansion and growth and the expectation that interest rates will not substantially decrease

this increase was primarily attributable to increased revenue 
cash collected over the twelve month period ended october  increased over the prior twelve month period 
credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of patients comprising the client base 
we have significant receivable balances with government payors and various insurance carriers 
generally  we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables  however  we continually monitor and evaluate our client acceptance and collection procedures to minimize potential credit risks associated with our accounts receivable 
while we maintain what we believe to be an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts  there can be no assurance that our ongoing review of accounts receivable will not result in the need for additional reserves 
such additional reserves could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in january  we amended our revolving loan agreement with pnc bank 
the maximum amount of the credit line available to the company is now the lesser of i  or ii of our qualified accounts receivable as defined in the agreement 
interest on advances are currently at prime or the eurodollar rate on a portion fixed of the line see note the credit line is collateralized by substantially all of our assets  a  careevolve promissory note payable out of our share of careevolve s net after tax income if any assigned by us to the bank and a  insurance policy on the life of the president of our company also assigned by us to the bank

new authoritative pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations in june  which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement legal obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  in august  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement retains the requirements of sfas no 
but removes goodwill from its scope and describes a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach in evaluating possible future cash flows to be used in impairment testing 
provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
l   and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
sfas among other things rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt sfas  and sfas no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements sfas and amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases sfas 
this statement updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
as a result of rescinding sfas and sfas  the criteria in apb no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring event and transactions  will be used to classify gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
sfas was amended to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions and makes technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after may   with earlier application encouraged

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and supercedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
the principal difference between sfas and eitf relates to the requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity  including those related to employee termination benefits and obligations under operating leases and other contracts  be recognized when the liability is incurred  and not necessarily the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan  as under eitg sfas also establishes that the initial measurement of a liability recognized under sfas be based on fair value 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged
