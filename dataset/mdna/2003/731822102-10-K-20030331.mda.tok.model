item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company s results of operation and financial position should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition  the certain business factor s described under business should be considered in evaluating the company s outlook 
critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management believes that it consistently applies judgments and estimates and such consistent application results in financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on the company s statement of operations and financial conditions 
critical accounting policies  as defined by the securities and exchange commission  are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company considers its critical accounting policies to be vendor and trade receivable allowances and valuation of long lived assets 
vendor and trade receivable allowances pomeroy maintains allowances for doubtful accounts on both vendor and trade receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers or vendors to make required payments 
the determination of a proper allowance for vendor receivables is based on an ongoing analysis as to the recoverability of the company s vendor receivable portfolio based primarily on account aging 
the determination of a proper allowance for trade receivables is based on an ongoing analysis as to the credit quality and recoverability of the company s trade receivable portfolio 
factors considered are account aging  historical bad debt experience  current economic trends and others 
the analysis is performed on both vendor and trade receivable portfolios 
a separate allowance account is maintained based on each analysis 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events or changes in facts and circumstances that pomeroy considers as impairment indicators include the following significant underperformance of the company s operating results relative to expected operating results  net book value compared to its market capitalization  significant adverse economic and industry trends  significant decrease in the market value of the asset  significant changes to the asset since the company acquired it  and the extent that the company may use an asset or changes in the manner that the company may use it 
when the company determines that one or more impairment indicators are present for its long lived assets  excluding goodwill  pomeroy compares the carrying amount of the asset to the new future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate  pomeroy would recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss would be the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
when the company determines that one or more impairment indicators are present for its goodwill  pomeroy compares its reporting unit s carrying value to its fair value 
the company has two reporting units for goodwill testing which are a products reporting unit and a services reporting unit 
as of january   the company had not recorded an impairment loss on its transitional testing of goodwill in connection with sfas the company has adopted january as the valuation date for the annual testing 
currently  the company has engaged a third party valuation specialist to perform the annual goodwill impairment testing as of january  an impairment loss  if any  would be reported in the company s future results of operations
