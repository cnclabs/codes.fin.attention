item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide healthcare staffing services and program management services for hospitals and skilled nursing facilities 
we derive our revenue from two business segments healthcare staffing and program management services 
our program management services segment includes inpatient programs including acute rehabilitation and skilled nursing units  outpatient therapy programs and contract therapy programs 
summarized information about our revenues and earnings from operations in each segment is provided below 
year ended december  in thousands revenues from unaffiliated customers healthcare staffing    program management inpatient    outpatient    contract therapy    program management total    total    operating earnings loss healthcare staffing    program management inpatient    outpatient    contract therapy   program management total    total    operating earnings for and have been adjusted to reflect the corporate expense allocation methodology utilized in revenues we derive substantially all of our revenues from fees paid directly by healthcare providers rather than through payment or reimbursement by government or other third party payers 
our inpatient and outpatient therapy programs are typically provided through agreements with hospital clients with three to five year terms 
our contract therapy and temporary healthcare staffing services are typically provided under interim or short term agreements with hospitals and skilled nursing facilities 
our healthcare staffing revenues and earnings are impacted by changes in the level of occupancy at hospitals where we provide our staffing services and fluctuation in our clients staffing levels 
these historical trends have shown an increase in the demand for our services in the first and fourth quarters of each year as hospitals generally experience an increase in the number of patients in the first quarter and experience increased vacation utilization of their staff during the fourth quarter 
hospitals generally experience a more stable work force during the second and third quarters  resulting in a decrease in the demand for our services and a decrease in our revenues and earnings for our healthcare staffing services business 
extended economic uncertainty may result in reduced supply of healthcare professionals to the temporary staffing industry 
full time  permanent employment may currently be preferred by nurses and other healthcare professionals as a means of ensuring family income during challenging economic times 
some hospitals are also offering greater financial and workplace incentives to recruit or retain permanent employees  thus reducing the hospital s demand for temporary staffing services 
it is not clear whether the duration of economic pressures or the sustainability of workplace incentives will be sufficient to overcome the larger  long term trend of healthcare labor shortages 
we believe that staffing services providers will continue to play an increasingly important role over the long term in helping hospitals successfully manage variable labor 
we believe that the economic uncertainty will improve over time and that the historical trends described above have shown these initiatives are unlikely to overcome the long term trend of a widening gap between required staffing levels and available staff 
as a provider of healthcare staffing and program management services  our revenues and growth are affected by trends and developments in healthcare spending 
over the last three years  our revenues and earnings from our program management services have been negatively impacted by an aggregate decline in average billable lengths of stay 
the decline in average billable lengths of stay reflects the continued trend of reduced rehabilitation lengths of stay 
going forward  we have minimized our exposure to revenue decreases as a result of decreased lengths of stay through restructuring our contracting philosophy to align our incentives with the hospitals incentives 
material changes in the rates or methods of government reimbursements to our clients for services rendered in the programs that we manage could give our clients the right to renegotiate their existing contracts with us to include terms that are less favorable to us 
for example  outpatient therapy programs receive payment from the medicare program under a fee schedule 
under current law  an outpatient therapy program that is not designated as being provider based is subject to an annual limit on payments for therapy services provided to medicare beneficiaries  however  these limits have been suspended through june  see discussion under item business government regulation provider based rules 
the secretary of the us department of health and human services is required to review reimbursement claims for outpatient therapy services while the moratorium is in effect and to make a proposal to congress to revise the payment system for outpatient therapy services 
any changes adopted by congress  which could include reduced annual limits or a new payment system  could have an adverse effect on the outpatient therapy program business 
in addition  changes in the rates or methods of government reimbursements could negatively impact the benefits that we are able to provide to our clients 
we believe the recently released rates and other reimbursement regulations with respect to the implementation of a prospective payment system for acute rehabilitation services will be favorable for the majority of our clients 
we are unable to predict with certainty the impact of any future changes  and we may experience a decline in our revenue and earnings as a result of any future changes to the prospective payment system or from any other changes in the rates or methods of government reimbursements

inflation although inflation has abated during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services continued to exceed the rate experienced by the economy as a whole

at december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable balances 
we determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectibility of specific accounts  historical experience and the aging of the accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze customers with historical poor payment history and customer credit worthiness when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
goodwill and other intangibles 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated first to their identifiable assets based on estimated fair values 
costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed  is recorded as goodwill 
prior to january   goodwill relating to acquisitions was amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
the amortization periods differed depending on whether the acquired entity was national in scope or a regional provider 
goodwill related to the acquisition of a national provider was amortized over years  while goodwill related to a regional provider was amortized over years 
on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under statement no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized and must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
if the impairment test indicates that the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss would be recognized in the statement of earnings in an amount equal to the excess carrying value 
there were no such impairments of goodwill and identified intangible assets during the periods presented 
if an impairment loss should occur in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
health  workers compensation  and professional liability insurance accrual 
we maintain an accrual for our health  workers compensation and professional liability insurances that are partially self insured and are classified in accrued salaries and wages health insurance and accrued expenses workers compensation and professional liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation  and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial computations and industry experience and trends 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we will adjust the assumptions utilized in our methodologies and reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our hospitals and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us  if we become aware of such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our borrowing capacity consists of a line of credit with interest rates that fluctuate based upon market indexes 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 
as such  risk relating to interest fluctuation is considered minimal
