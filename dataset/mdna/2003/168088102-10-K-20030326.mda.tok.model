results of operations for  the company posted increases in both revenues and net income compared with the company s performance is especially gratifying in view of available data indicating the level of industrial production within the manufacturing sector of the domestic economy declined again in with the notable exception of automobile production  we witnessed little  if any  improvement in conditions within our markets 
despite the fact that operating results improved  our enthusiasm is restrained by the knowledge that while revenues increased overall  gains were customer specific  rather than a broadly based improvement that would suggest the beginning of a sustained rebound 
indeed  while we are pleased to have successfully solicited new customers  and new business from existing customers  we are mindful that our markets continue to be intensely competitive  and  that as global sourcing becomes more widespread  we are also affected by customers decisions to shift manufacturing to facilities outside of the united states 
we continued to benefit from successful efforts to control many cost elements  however  costs of certain items such as health insurance  and to a lesser extent raw materials seem to be driven by factors that are beyond our immediate control 
despite the increase in operating levels within the automotive industry in  there were limited opportunities to recover these higher costs by increasing prices 
we see no reason to anticipate a meaningful change in this situation in the near future 
our past investments in new equipment have helped offset some of the increase in our costs of operations  while also expanding our capabilities and providing a foundation for the future 
compared to net sales and lease revenues improved approximately compared with and totaled  in as discussed below  revenue gains were achieved in both the fastener and assembly equipment segments and the increased volume  coupled with successful efforts to hold the line on costs  translated into improvements in gross margins  which amounted to  for  compared with  recorded in within the fastener segment  revenues increased  to  reflecting an overall increase in automobile production 
however  it should be noted that our volumes did not increase across our entire customer base 
instead  our overall gain was due to increases in business with certain key customers  bolstered by revenues related to new customers and new products from existing customers 
gross margins within the fastener segment improved to in  compared with recorded in this improvement is largely attributable to the effects of higher volumes and increases in efficiency associated with those higher volumes 
a number of other factors impacted operations during the year 
while we benefited from reductions in tooling costs  those savings were offset by increases in the cost of materials and by a substantial increase in the cost of employee health insurance 
activity levels within the assembly equipment segment remain well below the level that we consider normal 
while revenues within the segment improved to  in  compared with  in  the change is attributable to a few large orders and not due to any significant improvement in the market for equipment  which remains adversely affected by a persistent decline in the broad manufacturing sector and the related restraint on capital spending 
nevertheless  gross margins within this segment improved to approximately in compared with for this improvement is primarily attributable to higher volumes and reduced labor expense 
selling and administrative expenses increased approximately compared with both profit sharing and sales commissions increased as a result of higher sales and increased profits 
other factors contributing to the increase include higher salary expense and increased health insurance costs  partially offset by a decrease in the provision for bad debt expense  which was unusually high in the prior year due to the bankruptcy filing of a certain customer 
the company recorded net interest income during of  compared with net interest expense of  in  as a result of lower prevailing interest rates and reduced debt levels 
compared to the effect of the recession was apparent in the comparison of revenues and margins between and net sales and lease revenues fell to  in  a decline of compared to this lower level of operations was the primary factor contributing to the decrease in gross margins  which fell to  for  compared to  reported for revenues within the fastener segment declined and amounted to  during this decline stems from the combination of lower volumes for existing business  partially offset by successful efforts to win new business from both new and existing customers 
gross margins within this segment declined from in to for during the year  the company was able to take advantage of softness within the raw materials market  successfully negotiating price reductions for certain raw materials and supplies 
unfortunately  the positive contribution from those activities was offset by increases in the cost of health insurance and a somewhat higher cost for perishable tooling 
other than those two areas  we were generally successful in reducing our variable costs in a manner consistent with the reduced level of operations 
fixed costs  as would be expected  remained relatively unchanged despite the reduced levels of operations 
the domestic metalworking machinery market suffered a significant decline in  with overall activity falling to its lowest level in nearly a decade 
these conditions were plainly evident in the results of operations within our assembly equipment segment 
revenues fell to  during  compared to  recorded during despite our efforts to reduce costs and manage the negative effects of lower volumes  we were unable to cut costs as quickly and as deeply as demand declined 
because we believe that this downturn is of a cyclical nature  we made a decision to attempt to maintain as much of our skilled workforce as possible  rather than attempt to match volume declines with a wholesale reduction in the workforce 
as a result  labor and benefit costs remained at levels somewhat higher than might otherwise be expected  given recent business conditions 
on a short term basis  we view this as the most practical response to what we believe will be a temporary situation 
we were able to achieve only limited reductions in fixed costs compared with the prior year 
the net result was an overall decline in gross margins  which fell to approximately in  compared to recorded in selling and administrative expenses declined significantly compared with the prior year 
successful completion of the first phase of implementation of new data processing systems resulted in a significant reduction in consulting expenses compared with the prior year 
in addition  salary and benefit expenses declined significantly due to reductions in headcount  achieved mainly through attrition 
sales commissions and profit sharing expense declined to levels consistent with the lower sales volumes and lower income  respectively 
unfortunately  bad debt expense increased by a net amount of  mainly due to the third quarter bankruptcy filing of a certain customer 
lower prevailing interest rates  combined with lower debt  resulted in a net interest expense reduction of  dividends the company paid four regular quarterly dividends of 
per share during in addition  an extra dividend of 
per share was paid during the second quarter of  bringing the total dividend distribution to 
per share 
on february  your board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 
per share  payable march  to shareholders of record march  this continues the uninterrupted record of consecutive quarterly dividends paid by the company to its shareholders that extends over years 
at that same meeting  the board declared an extra dividend of 
per share  payable april  to shareholders of record on april  machinery and equipment investments in machinery and equipment totaled  in the majority of this investment was related to the fastener segment of our operations 
approximately  was invested in new equipment directly related to the manufacture of fasteners  with an additional  expended for equipment related to quality control and finishing operations for the fastener segment 
the balance was expended for a variety of miscellaneous items  including material handling  data processing and other equipment 
the company invested approximately million in machinery  equipment and building improvements during the majority of these expenditures were related to the fastener segment of our operations 
specifically  a total of million was expended for the purchase of equipment used directly in the manufacture of fasteners and  was invested in new equipment related to the quality control process in fastener manufacturing 
 was expended in connection with data processing and data communications equipment   was spent for building improvements  primarily related to the fastener segment of our business  and the balance was expended for a variety of smaller machinery and equipment  including the manufacture of automatic rivet setting equipment that is leased to our customers 
capital investments totaled approximately million during slightly over million of this total was invested in new equipment related to the production of fasteners 
of the amount expended within the fastener segment  million was invested in new cold heading and thread forming equipment and certain support equipment 
this equipment was purchased to expand our capacity to manufacture certain specialty products for which demand has exceeded our capacity 
certain obsolete heat treating equipment was replaced at a cost of  the balance was expended for various smaller projects  including new quality control equipment and building improvements 
within the assembly equipment segment  capital expenditures totaled  primarily for the replacement of machine tools used in the manufacture of perishable tooling that is sold to our customers 
the balance was expended for data processing equipment and various office equipment 
depreciation expense amounted to  in   in  and  in liquidity and capital resources at year end  working capital amounted to million  an increase of million compared with year end the most significant change in working capital components was the increase in accounts receivable 
this increase is due to two factors higher sales in the latter part of the year in compared with and  to a lesser extent  changes in the payment practices of certain customers 
as a result  our credit risk is somewhat greater than in the past  but we do not believe that this change in payment practices represents a significant deterioration in the quality of receivables 
in connection with a dutch auction tender offer in april  the company obtained  on an unsecured basis  a financing commitment that provided borrowing capacity of up to million  plus a million line of credit 
the new borrowing was used to finance the unpaid balance of a loan related to the acquisition of h l tool company  inc million and to fund the purchase of stock under the terms of the dutch auction 
at december   the indebtedness under the term loan was approximately million 
under the terms of the note  the company is scheduled to repay the principal in quarterly installments of  plus interest computed on the unpaid balance at a variable rate that is calculated under one of two methods  selected at the option of the company the london inter bank offering rate libor plus an applicable margin  or the lender s prime rate  less an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is based upon the funded debt ratio and  for any portion of the loan that bears interest at the prime rate  this margin is up to basis points  and for any portion that bears interest at the libor rate  it is up to basis points 
this rate is adjusted quarterly and was approximately at december  the line of credit was extended through may  and remained unused at december  the loan agreement expires on march   at which time any unpaid principal and interest is due 
management believes that current cash  cash equivalents  operating cash flow and the available line of credit will be sufficient to provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future 
the company has not entered into  and has no current plans to enter into  any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
the company has no long term supply contracts that will have a material impact on liquidity and financial resources 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
during interim periods  the company uses estimated gross profit rates to determine the cost of goods sold for a portion of its operations 
actual results can vary from these estimates  and these estimates are adjusted  as necessary  when actual information is available 
the effect of these estimates is described in note new accounting standards the company s financial statements and financial condition were not  and are not expected to be  materially impacted by new  or proposed  accounting standards 
stock purchase program terms of a stock repurchase authorization originally approved by the board of directors in february of  and subsequently amended to permit the repurchase of an aggregate of  shares  permit purchases of the company s common stock to be made from time to time  in the open market or in private transactions  at prices deemed reasonable by management 
during  the company purchased  shares at an average price of per share 
cumulative purchases under the current repurchase authorization have amounted to  shares at an average price of per share 
in addition to the purchases described above  the company purchased  shares at a price of per share pursuant to a dutch auction tender offer completed in april outlook for much of last year s success was attributable to the surprising strength of the automotive industry 
excluding the automotive sector  domestic manufacturing activity exhibited very little strength during some analysts express doubt that the automotive sector can repeat its performance in still  others expect the rest of the manufacturing sector will soon recover from its current weakness  mitigating the effects of a decline in automobile manufacturing 
early indications from customers within our markets suggest that meaningful improvement is still some distance away 
our order levels are approximately the same as they were one year ago  and although our quotation activity has picked up slightly  that increased activity has not yet been translated into increased orders 
margins will likely remain under pressure from the combination of rising costs and customers expectations that we reduce our prices in order to successfully compete with global producers 
in many respects  seems likely to present many of the same challenges we have faced in the recent past 
fortunately  the company can continue to rely upon highly skilled and dedicated employees who have consistently demonstrated that they are equal to those challenges 
we gratefully acknowledge their contributions  as well as the continued loyalty and support of our customers and our shareholders 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk over time  the company is exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates 
the company has not historically used derivative financial instruments 
as of december   million of floating rate debt was exposed to changes in interest rates compared to million at the prior year end 
this exposure was primarily linked to the london inter bank offering rate and the lender s prime rate under the company s term loan 
a hypothetical change in these rates would not have had a material effect on the company s annual earnings
