in january  we completed the acquisition of vifi to increase our customer count and expand our market share 
vifi  a privately owned company based in indianapolis  indiana  provided retail and commercial internet banking  electronic bill payment  cash management services  credit and debit card processing  online brokerage  document management  web site design  target marketing and aggregation services via pc based or wireless access 
the vifi acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and our results of operations include the operations of vifi subsequent to the acquisition date

no adjustments were necessary to conform accounting policies of the entities 
there were no inter company transactions requiring elimination in any period presented 
during  we also completed our acquisitions of view and ata 
both of these transactions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
these acquisitions allowed us to expand our product line to include an electronic bill presentment and payment product and an online decisioning product 
since the acquisition of ata in july  we have managed our business through two reportable segments the internet banking division and the lending division 
no customer accounts for more than of our business and we have no foreign operations

we derive revenues primarily from long term service contracts with our financial institution customers  which pay recurring service fees based primarily on the number of end users or end user transactions  or fixed monthly amounts for hosting and maintaining web sites  as well as upfront implementation fees and optional services 
revenue from recurring service fees are recognized as services are provided 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab prior to the adoption of sab  we recognized implementation fee revenue upon the completion of the implementation process  which was typically to days after contract initiation 
we also deferred the direct implementation costs and recognized them upon completion of the implementation 
under sab  we defer recognition of certain implementation fee revenue  which includes set up fees for each service element purchased by customers and mandatory training  that are not the culmination of a separate earnings process and recognize them ratably over the greater of the initial life of the customer contract or the estimated life of the customer service relationship  generally four years 
we also defer recognition of the related direct incremental implementation costs and recognize them ratably over the same period 
direct incremental implementation costs are comprised primarily of salaries and benefits of implementation personnel  consulting fees paid to third party implementation consultants and set up fees paid to third party vendors 
the adoption of sab resulted in a million cumulative effect adjustment at january  and a million increase in our net loss for to reflect the increase in deferred implementation revenue partially offset by the increase in deferred direct implementation costs 
the revenue recognized in and that was included in the sab cumulative effect adjustment was million and million  respectively 
other revenues are derived from web site design services  optional consulting and training services and other optional products or services purchased separately by customers and license fees for licensing technology to non service customers 
these other revenues are recognized upon the completion or delivery of the product or service assuming we have no remaining obligations  the amounts due are fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
cost of revenues is comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  network costs  expenses related to the operation of our data centers and fees paid to third parties  including bill payment vendors  data processing vendors and communication services providers

there is no unamortized deferred stock based compensation at december  we have recorded restructuring charges of million in and million in during  we strategically restructured our business primarily to reduce operating expenses from redundant functions and facilities that resulted from the three acquisitions completed in as a result of this process  employee positions were eliminated and our facility in san francisco  california was closed 
during  we restructured certain operations to optimize our cost structure by geographically consolidating certain business functions including customer services  web services and software development 
as a result of these restructuring activities  we have reduced space utilized at three facilities  terminated employees and relocated or reassigned employees 
we also recorded an asset impairment charge of million in the first quarter of for long lived assets primarily comprised of purchased computer software and equipment that were abandoned or removed from operations in the first quarter of we adopted sfas no 
in the first quarter of which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million relating to the ata acquisition as a result of applying the fair value method for assessing impairment as required by sfas no 
this amount has been recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations 
on march   we entered into an agreement to settle the fundsxpress lawsuit and consequently provided million in litigation settlement costs  net of probable insurance recoveries  for the year ended december  as further described in item legal proceedings 
during  we expect to incur state tax charges as a result of california s recent decision to temporarily prohibit the carry forward of prior years operating losses to offset current taxable income 
we have not incurred such charges in the past

this increase of  or  is the result of an increase in applications processed from  in to  in offset by the effect of a shift away from call center applications to internet applications

excluding the impact of deferred stock based compensation  gross margin for the internet banking division increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit margin for the internet banking division is primarily attributable to the leverage in our business model that leads to an expansion in gross profit margin as revenues increase above our relatively fixed cost base

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
due to the adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million 
this amount represents a write down of a portion of the goodwill related to the ata acquisition for which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the estimated fair value determined by using the fair value method of impairment assessment prescribed by sfas no

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred taxes  impairment of long lived assets  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition policy 
we recognize revenue as discussed in the preceding overview section of management s discussion and analysis 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses associated with the potential inability of our customers to make required payments or for resolution of potential billing disputes 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
similarly  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would reduce income in the period such determination was made 
impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 both adopted on january   which generally require us to assess these assets for recoverability at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
we use the fair value method to assess our goodwill and the undiscounted cash flows method to assess qualifying identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets 
as discussed in the overview section above  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million upon adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of future impairment assessments could result in additional impairment charges that would further reduce the carrying values of these assets 
contingencies and litigation 
we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
we make these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel 
provision for income taxes we incurred operating losses from inception through december  and we had minimal taxable income in relative to prior year losses 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the benefits in future tax returns  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
the state tax loss carry forwards began to expire in and the federal tax loss carry forwards will begin to expire in under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  certain substantial changes in ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carry forwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
our short term investments are comprised of a certificate of deposit and readily marketable commercial paper 
our intent is to hold these investments to maturity 
for financial statement presentation  we classify our investments as short term and long term based upon their maturity dates 
we had no long term investments at december  the value of our commercial paper is sensitive to changes in the level of us interest rates and the market ratings of the underlying companies 
therefore  if our commercial paper is sold prior to its maturity date  a gain or loss may result 
in october  we entered into a revised agreement for a million revolving credit commitment with a bank  or the revolver  that expires on october  interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly 
the interest rate on the revolver is equal to either i the bank s prime rate  ii libor plus when aggregate borrowings on the revolver are less than or equal to million  or iii libor plus when aggregate borrowing on the revolver are more than million 
we may draw down against the revolver by electing either the bank s prime rate or libor for specified month  month  month  or month libor terms 
as of december   million was outstanding under the revolver with an interest rate of  or month libor plus on the date we borrowed against the revolver 
on january   we repaid the million balance on the revolver 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the improvement of million resulted from a reduction in net losses in  after adding back the non cash charges along with increased collections of accounts receivables balances 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
the improvement in of million was a result of reduced net losses in after adding back non cash charges 
cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december   including acquisitions  was million  compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  cash flows from investing activities in improved by million  primarily due to maturities of investments  offset by cash applied to acquisitions of million 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
the increase in cash used for of million was a result of increased purchases of investments  partially offset by decreased purchases of property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to a repayment of principal on long term debt  partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
the decrease of million was primarily the result of the offering proceeds received in we have no material commitments other than our revolver  a note payable to a shareholder associated with the vifi acquisition due in  obligations under our operating and capital leases  and minimum vendor commitments 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
our commitments under these obligations are as follows payment schedule total thereafter in thousands revolver capital lease obligations note payable operating leases minimum vendor commitments total obligations future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the timing of research and product development efforts  any expansion of our marketing efforts  and any acquisitions 
we expect to continue to expend significant amounts on ongoing research and development  computer and related data center equipment  and personnel 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funds available under our revolver will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
we intend to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
supersedes the existing guidance related to accounting and reporting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under sfas no 
 a liability for a cost associated with an exit or a disposal activity will be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we adopted this standard on january  for future exit or disposal activities  however there is no impact from adoption of this standard on our restructuring plans already initiated 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets  which establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost 
it also provides accounting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  and the adoption of this new standard did not have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition disclosure an amendment of fas this statement amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   and disclosure requirements shall be effective for interim periods beginning after december  we intend to continue to account for stock based compensation to our employees and directors using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 and related interpretations 
we have made certain disclosures required by sfas no 
in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and will begin making the additional interim disclosures required by sfas no 
in the first quarter of accordingly  adoption of sfas no 
will not impact our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  due mainly to the fixed rate  short term nature of the substantial majority of our investment portfolio 
we are also exposed to the impact of interest rate changes as they affect our revolving credit commitment 
the interest rate charged on the revolver varies with the bank s prime rate or libor and  consequently  our interest expense will fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the revolver at an interest rate of 
if interest rates were to increase by basis points  the impact on interest expense would not be significant 
on january   we repaid the balance on the revolver 
we are not exposed to foreign currency risk since all revenues and expenses are in us dollars 
there were no significant changes to our market risk in
