item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when you read this section of this report  it is important that you also read the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those we anticipate in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and in risk factors 
overview dusa is a pharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the research  development  and marketing of a drug named aminolevulinic acid  or ala  used in combination with appropriate light devices in order to detect or treat a variety of medical conditions 
the trademark for our brand of ala is levulan r 
when levulan r is used and followed with exposure to light to produce a therapeutic effect  the technology is called photodynamic therapy  or pdt 
when levulan r is used and followed with exposure to light to detect medical conditions  the technology is called photodetection  or pd 
our first products  which were launched in september in the united states  are levulan r topical solution using our kerastick r brand applicator  and our blu u r brand light unit 
our products are used together to provide pdt for the treatment of non hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses  or aks  of the face or scalp 
we have primarily devoted our resources to funding research and development in order to advance the levulan r pdt pd technology platform  and as a result  we have experienced significant operating losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  achieving our goal of becoming a profitable operating company is dependent upon the market penetration of our products  acceptance of our therapy by the medical and consumer constituencies  and our ability to develop new products 
we have been encouraged by the positive response from many physicians and patients who have used our therapy  but recognize that we have to demonstrate the clinical value of our new and unique therapy  and the benefits compared to other well established conventional therapies  in order for the medical community to accept our products on a large scale 
we also recognize that market acceptance has taken longer than we originally anticipated  and has not reached the levels that were originally expected 
as of march   the national reimbursement code for medicare and other third party payors for the blu u r application procedure  and for the costs of the levulan r kerastick r  became effective 
doctors can also bill for any applicable visit fees 
however  some physicians have suggested that even the new reimbursement levels still do not fully reflect the required efforts to routinely execute our therapy in their practices 
in addition  others have reported problems prior to march  of getting reimbursed at the level indicated  or at all 
these issues have affected the economic competitiveness of our products with other ak therapies and hence have hindered the adoption of our therapy in many cases 
accordingly  we are continuing to support efforts to improve reimbursement levels to physicians  work with the major private insurance carriers to reimburse our therapy  and to resolve related billing and payment issues  which we believe could significantly improve physician adoption 
we are hopeful that the recent changes to reimbursement  plus future improvements  along with our education and marketing programs  will help make levulan r pdt a common therapy for aks over time 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses  despite this year s net gain due to the financial reporting of the termination of our dermatology collaboration agreement  until the successful market penetration of our first products occurs 
we are focusing our near term dermatology research and development efforts on the commencement of clinical trials which  if successful  could lead to approval of a broader ak indication 
as a result of the termination of our former dermatology collaboration arrangement  we have reevaluated our expenses and intend to minimize research and development and related general and administrative expenditures that are not directly related to our core objectives for during  we decreased our staff to full time employees by year end as compared to at the end of the previous year 
we expect to slightly increase our staff in as we focus on marketing activities and customer support associated with reacquiring the rights to our ak products  and research and development programs for dermatology and internal indications 
while our financial position is strong  we cannot predict when product sales along with interest and or other income may offset the cost of these efforts 
we have incurred scale up and certain fixed costs resulting in under absorbed overhead  which are included in cost of product sales and royalties 
once our manufacturing facility is operational  management plans to continuously monitor the cost of product sales with the goal of reducing our costs over time 
we expect that the development of our own facility will enable us to better manage and control the costs of production  however  our unit cost per kerastick r is expected to be higher initially  until product sales increase significantly 
construction started in january  and was completed during facility qualification  process validation  drug product stability testing  and fda review and approval are expected to be completed during this new facility replaces our former third party kerastick r manufacturer 
for non dermatology indications  such as treatment of dysplasia in patients with barrett s esophagus  we may enter into joint development or licensing arrangements  both domestically and internationally  with pharmaceutical or medical device companies  as we did with photonamic for fluorescent guided resection of brain cancer 
however  at this point in time  we have decided not to seek a new dermatology collaboration 
to the extent that we do not enter into such arrangements  we may require separate funding to complete the regulatory approval process for our non dermatology products and would likely need additional funds to market such products 
termination of dermatology collaboration agreement on september   dusa and schering ag  our former marketing and development partner for levulan r pdt in the field of dermatology  terminated our marketing  development and supply agreement  dated november   as amended 
as a result  we reacquired all of the rights we granted to schering ag under the agreement 
co development revenue from schering ag was earned as we performed research  and deferred revenue relating to previously received milestone payments was being amortized into income over the year life of our terminated agreement 
due to the termination of the agreement  unamortized deferred revenue and related deferred charges were recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   resulting in a net profit for rather than a net loss had the agreement remained effective 
schering ag agreed to continue its financial support for the dermatology research and development program for the remainder of  including payments totaling  by december   and to complete several ongoing clinical studies for our benefit 
no further payments are due to us from schering ag 
schering ag will transfer all of its interest in the regulatory filings it made in brazil 
however  as we have determined that we should concentrate solely on the us market at this time  we authorized schering ag to withdraw the applications for regulatory approval of levulan r pdt in austria  australia  and south africa 
the regulatory approvals for canada held by draxis health  inc and brazil will be maintained 
due to the termination of our former dermatology collaboration arrangement  we evaluated certain items on our consolidated balance sheet for the timing of revenue recognition and potential impairment 
these items included unamortized deferred revenue related to non refundable milestone payments previously received under the schering ag agreement  and approximately  in assets  including our nearly completed manufacturing facility  raw material and finished goods inventories  commercial light units in the field  and deferred charges and royalties 
as a result of this analysis  in addition to normal amortization recorded prior to the termination of the agreement  we recorded the following items in our financial statements for the year ended december  revenue financial recognition statement asset footnote statement of operations item balance sheet item impairment reference revenues research grant and milestone revenue deferred revenue  note operating costs cost of product sales deferred charges  note inventory  note blu u r units under lease or rental  note research and development costs deferred royalty  note total charges to operating costs we concluded that the carrying value of our nearly completed manufacturing facility is more likely than not to be fully recoverable after considering the effects of the change in business circumstances caused by the termination of our former dermatology collaboration arrangement 
therefore  no impairment charges associated with the facility were recorded in  however  we will continue to periodically review the carrying value of the facility 
following the reacquisition of rights from our former partner  we commenced our own marketing  education  and development strategy 
we will continue to develop and implement such strategies directly and will incur significant expenses relating to these activities 
on september   we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with moore medical corporation to distribute the kerastick r throughout the united states 
see section entitled management s discussion and analysis overview  third party distribution agreement 
for now  we have decided not to create a nationwide sales force  or to seek a new dermatology marketing partner 
should we decide to hire a sales force  we will incur significant expenses relating to these activities 
initially  we intend to focus on establishing a clear position for our therapy in the marketplace  meeting the needs of dermatologists  and educating them about the benefits of our therapy  in an effort to increase product sales over time 
this will be accomplished through the support of medical education activities  participation in dermatology conferences  support of company sponsored research and development efforts and independent investigator studies  and support of efforts to improve third party reimbursement 
we intend to carry out some limited regional test marketing strategies during  and depending on the response  we may consider building a sales force in the future 
we are also planning clinical studies  which if successful  could support a broader ak indication 
we are also offering a new blu u r placement program for physicians  rather than the former rental and long term lease arrangements  and have introduced a kerastick r sampling program to allow new doctors to become familiar with the therapy 
third party distribution agreement effective september   we engaged moore medical corporation  a national distributor and marketer of medical and surgical supplies  to be our exclusive distributor of the kerastick r in the united states 
the agreement has a year term  which can be automatically renewed for additional year terms  unless either party notifies the other party prior to a term expiration that it does not intend to renew the agreement 
in addition  either party may terminate the agreement earlier  on certain terms  or in the event that the other party shall have materially breached any of its obligations in the agreement 
moore has a right to return its inventory of kerastick r units for full credit for a period of time prior to and after the expiration date of the agreement 
accordingly  we recognize product sales when moore sells the kerastick r to the end user as the price is fixed and final to moore at that point 
third party kerastick r manufacturer agreement modification in early  we agreed to compensate north safety products  inc north  the manufacturer of our kerastick r brand applicator  for certain overhead expenses associated with the manufacture of the kerastick r to cover underutilization of north s facilities  in accordance with an amendment to the purchase and supply agreement  since our order levels were below certain previously anticipated levels 
we reported the total commitment of  in deferred charges  and recognized this amount in cost of product sales and royalties from july through december in consideration for the underutilization fees  north agreed to maintain its kerastick r manufacturing capabilities in a state of readiness through december  north manufactured and delivered approximately  kerastick r units to us during the fourth quarter of in september  in accordance with an amendment to our former agreement with schering ag  schering ag reimbursed  of the costs we incurred to modify our manufacturing agreement with north 
this amount was reported in deferred liabilities and was recognized as an offset to cost of product sales and royalties on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement with north through december in early  in order to meet the production scheduling needs of our third party manufacturer of the blu u r  national biological corporation nbc  we prepaid raw material costs in the amount of  associated with our orders 
this amount was credited against the final purchase price of finished units  which was due on delivery at the rate of  per completed unit 
at the end of december  approximately  of this prepayment remained outstanding and was recorded in other current assets 
during  the balance of this credit was applied to other invoices and no amount remained outstanding at december  the agreement has a term of years which expires in  subject to earlier termination for breach or insolvency or for convenience on months prior written notice 
shareholder rights plan in order to protect the long term interest of our shareholders  we adopted a shareholder rights plan  on september  see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements shareholder rights plan 
the shareholder rights plan is designed to prevent an acquirer from gaining control of the company without offering a fair price to all of our shareholders 
the shareholder rights plan was not adopted by the board in response to any specific offer or threat  but rather is intended to protect the interests of shareholders in the event we are confronted in the future with an unfriendly takeover attempt 
issuance of shares of common stock under the shareholder rights plan could be used to make a change in control of our company more difficult or costly by diluting stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us 
in addition  the board of directors adopted certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation which are consistent with the terms of the plan 
license and supply agreements on december   we entered into a license and development agreement with photonamic gmbh co 
kg  a subsidiary of medac gmbh  a german pharmaceutical company  and a supply agreement for the licensed formulation with medac 
these agreements provide for the licensing to us of photonamic s proprietary technology related to ala for systemic dosing in the field of brain cancer 
the technology provides us with access to a systemic formulation of ala  and a significant amount of pre clinical data  both of which could also be useful and are licensed to us for certain other indications 
photonamic is currently conducting a european phase iii clinical trial in which ala induced fluorescence is used to guide surgical tumor resection in patients suffering from the most aggressive form of adult brain tumor  glioblastoma multiforme 
this clinical trial is expected to continue through late  at a minimum 
our license covers both this primary clinical indication as well as other brain cancers 
based on the license agreement  dusa paid photonamic a non refundable  milestone payment in early this amount was charged to research and development costs in the consolidated statement of operations in the year ended december  we will also be obligated to pay certain regulatory milestones and royalties on net sales of a brain cancer product under the terms of the license and development agreement and will purchase product under the supply agreement for mutually agreed upon indications 
should photonamic s clinical study be successful  we will be obligated to proceed with development of the product in the united states in order to retain the license for the use of the technology to treat brain cancer 
we are unable to determine at this time whether these obligations will mature 
australian patent litigation in april  we received a copy of a notice issued by photocure asa to queen s university at kingston  ontario  alleging that australian patent no 
 which is one of the patents licensed by parteq to us  relating to aminolevulinic acid technology  is invalid 
as a consequence of this action  queen s university has assigned the australian patent to us so that we may participate directly in this litigation 
we have filed an answer setting forth our defenses and a related countersuit alleging that photocure s activities infringe the patent 
the case is in its earliest stages so we are unable to predict the outcome at this time 
critical accounting policies in may  the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued disclosure guidance and proposed rules for critical accounting policies entitled disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about the application of critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods and that can significantly affect our financial position and results of operations 
our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
since all of these accounting policies do not require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates  they are not all considered critical accounting policies 
we have discussed these policies and the underlying estimates used in applying these accounting policies with our audit committee 
we consider the following policies and estimates to be critical to our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues on product sales of the kerastick r are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred  and there is reasonableness of collection 
research revenue earned under collaborative agreements consisted of non refundable research and development funding from our former dermatology collaboration partner 
research revenue generally compensates us for a portion of agreed upon research and development expenses and is recognized as revenue at the time the research and development activities are performed under the terms of the related agreements and when no future performance obligations exist 
milestone or other up front payments have been recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and are recognized as income on a straight line basis over the term of our agreement with our former collaborator 
although we make every effort to assure the reasonableness of our estimates  significant unanticipated changes in our estimates due to business  economic  or industry events could have a material impact on our results of operations 
as a consequence of the termination of dusa s former dermatology collaboration arrangement  we recorded  of previously received research grant and milestone revenue  in addition to normal amortization recorded prior to the termination  in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december   resulting in a net profit for the year despite minimal product sales 
see section entitled management s discussion and analysis overview  termination of dermatology collaboration agreement 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
inventories are continually reviewed for slow moving  obsolete and excess items 
inventory items identified as slow moving are evaluated to determine if an adjustment is required 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular technological developments that could result in obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to assure the reasonableness of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  technological development  or significant changes to our business model could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
in september  based on the termination of our former dermatology collaboration arrangement  we recorded lower of cost or market adjustments of  for excess inventory and commercial light units under lease  rental  or trial arrangements to cost of product sales in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  we used sales projections to estimate the appropriate level of inventory that should remain on the consolidated balance sheet 
management believes that the level of remaining inventory is reasonable in light of our current sales forecasts and uncertainties relating to the timing of fda approval of our manufacturing facility 
should we be unable to achieve the forecasted sales  additional adjustments may be recorded to cost of goods sold 
see section entitled management s discussion and analysis overview  termination of dermatology collaboration agreement 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we review long lived and intangible assets  comprised of property  plant and equipment  deferred charges  and deferred royalties for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes relative to i projected future operating results  ii the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii business collaborations  and iv industry  business  or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
when it is determined that the carrying value of long lived or intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
in  we concluded that the termination of our former dermatology collaboration arrangement did not cause any impairment of our manufacturing facility under construction  but did result in impairment charges to operations of  related to adjustments of certain intangible assets as more fully discussed in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see section entitled management s discussion and analysis overview  termination of dermatology collaboration agreement 
at december   our total property  plant and equipment had a carrying value of  including  associated with our manufacturing facility  and we had no intangible assets recorded as of that date 
stock based compensation we have elected to continue to use the intrinsic value based method to account for employee stock option awards under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 and to provide disclosures based on the fair value method in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
stock or other equity based compensation for non employees is accounted for under the fair value based method as required by sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and other related interpretations 
under this method  the equity based instrument is valued at either the fair value of the consideration received or the equity instrument issued on the date of grant 
the resulting compensation cost is recognized and charged to operations over the service period  which  in the case of stock options  is generally the vesting period 
as we utilize stock and stock options as one means of compensating employees  consultants  and others  the accounting for stock based compensation could  under certain circumstances  result in a material effect on our results of operations  but would not affect cash flow based on our current stock option plan 
results of operations year ending december  as compared to revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  in research grant and milestone revenues were  in  as compared to  and included the one time recognition in september of unamortized up front milestone and unrestricted grant payments previously received from schering ag totaling  due to the finalization of this relationship in september  and normal amortization of  received prior to the termination 
in  research grant and milestone revenue included normal amortization of  see section entitled management s discussion and analysis overview  termination of dermatology collaboration agreement 
revenues for also included  of research and development reimbursement which we earned from our former marketing partner  as compared to  in due to the termination of this agreement  we will not receive any co development revenue from schering ag subsequent to revenues for also included product sales and rental income of  as compared to  in  reflecting  of direct kerastick r sales from our distributor  moore medical corporation  to physicians 
we believe that the decline in direct kerastick r sales in as compared to is due mainly to the limited acceptance of our therapy  reimbursement issues  and need for additional medical education for the optimum use of our therapy 
also included in product sales and rental income were royalty revenues of  which we earned for kerastick r sales by berlex  the subsidiary of our former marketing partner  to its distributor 
in  we had no direct kerastick r sales to berlex 
in  product sales and rental income included direct kerastick r sales of  to berlex as berlex purchased kerastick r units to fill the anticipated forecasts at the time the units were ordered  royalty revenues of  rental income of  and miscellaneous product sales of  in september  we initiated a new blu u r placement strategy as part of our new marketing initiatives 
under this plan  physicians receive the blu u r unit in exchange for an agreement to purchase a minimum of kerastick r units each year 
previous blu u r marketing programs  which included leasing or renting the blu u r to physicians  medical institutions and academic centers  have been terminated 
as of december   excluding blu u r units installed at clinical trial sites or sold to our former partner  blu u r units were in place  up from the units at december  kerastick r sales to end users were  in as compared to  in we believe that as doctors become more familiar with the benefits of levulan r pdt  if an fda approval for a broader ak indication claim is achieved  and improved reimbursement for physicians is attained  more widespread adoption of our technology should occur over time 
cost of product sales and royalties cost of product sales and royalties for the year ended december  were  as compared to  in the increase was mainly attributed to the recognition of  for lower of cost or market inventory adjustments  increased depreciation taken on blu u r units  and deferred charges associated with our amended supply agreement with sochinaz sa  which were based on i the termination of our former dermatology collaboration arrangement  ii limited product sales since the september product launch  and iii our expectation of no significant near term increases in kerastick r sales levels and or blu u r placements

underutilization costs commenced in based on an agreement with our thirty party kerastick r manufacturer  north safety products  inc  due to orders falling below certain previously anticipated levels 
amortization of deferred charges reflects consideration paid by us in to amend our supply agreement with sochinaz sa  the manufacturer of the bulk drug ingredient used in levulan r 
amortization for reflects amount recorded prior to the termination of our former dermatology collaboration arrangement 
for  direct kerastick r product costs reflect costs recognized based on direct kerastick r sales since september  to our distributor  moore medical corporation 
see section entitled management s discussion and analysis overview  third party distribution agreement 
historically  inventory costs related to the blu u r units under rental or lease were deferred until the blu u r was no longer returnable to us by the physician  which was one year under the initial marketing program 
as of december  and  blu u units included in property  plant and equipment amounted to approximately  and  net of depreciation of  and  this decrease includes an additional  of depreciation expense recorded in reflecting a shortened useful life of our blu u r units under lease  rental  or trial arrangements to reflect a three year asset life 
this accelerated depreciation policy is attributed to the low level of blu u r placements to date  the termination of our former dermatology collaboration arrangement  including the decision not to launch the blu u r in non us markets except possibly canada and or brazil at this time  and management s expectations that near term placements will be limited 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements termination of dermatology collaboration agreement 
research and development costs research and development costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for this increase in research and development costs for is attributable to the write off of  of previously deferred royalties associated with payments to parteq  our licensor  and a  milestone payment under our license agreement signed on december  between dusa and photonamic gmbh co 
kg  a subsidiary of medac gmbh  a german pharmaceutical company 
this agreement provides for the licensing to us of photonamic s proprietary technology related to ala for systemic dosing in the field of brain cancer 
research and development costs for also included higher third party expenditures in support of our fda mandated phase iv clinical study of the long term efficacy of our marketed product  clinical feasibility studies in other dermatological indications  and our phase i ii clinical studies on the safety and efficacy of levulan pdt treatment of barrett s esophagus with and without dysplasia 
as stated above  under our former agreement with schering ag   of the agreed upon dermatology research and development expenses were reimbursed to us by schering ag for as compared to  for the currently approved levulan r kerastick r only allows application of levulan r to individual lesions using the kerastick r  so we are seeking to apply levulan r to the entire face or scalp in a broad area actinic keratoses baak treatment 
we are developing a revised protocol for our blu u r treatment allowing the use of the levulan r kerastick r for the baak indication after a much shorter drug incubation time 
we believe that should clinical development of this indication be successful and approved as a broader ak indication  the market penetration of the therapy could be significantly enhanced 
we also intend to complete our fda required phase iv long term ak tracking study before the end of data from our phase i ii study on resistant plantar warts was encouraging  but was not designed to be statistically significant 
however  our phase ii study on onychomycosis nail fungus did not appear to show success in treating the disease in the majority of patients 
further phase ii development for the warts and onychomycosis indications are not planned at this time in order to control our total research and development spending for and beyond 
this strategy should keep us in a strong financial position as we develop the baak indication  complete the long term tracking study  and implement activities to increase revenues from the current product 
we have also been conducting phase i ii studies in the treatment of high grade and low grade dysplasia associated with barrett s esophagus 
while limited investigator studies in the high grade dysplasia indication will still be funded  we do not expect to fund full phase ii or iii clinical trials for this indication on our own 
as of january  with months of follow up in patients  and months in patient  results of the high grade dysplasia hgd study of five patients showed a continued absence of dysplasia ie complete ablation  no strictures  and no signs of mucosal overgrowth 
in our low grade dysplasia early stage clinical trial in which the primary efficacy goal is the conversion of barrett s esophagus to normal esophagus  patients have been treated with levulan pdt and are still being followed 
there was patient in this study that had mild esophageal scarring without symptoms 
we have begun soliciting potential partners for this indication 
management s goal is to complete a partnership for this indication during  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate any collaboration  or whether we will be able to obtain terms acceptable to us 
we also anticipate continued funding for various investigator studies involving the kerastick r 
general and administrative costs general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for this increase is mainly attributed to higher legal expenses incurred in of  as compared to  in  due primarily to patent defense costs  the termination of our former dermatology collaboration arrangement  and strategic initiatives 
it is expected that legal expenses will remain at elevated levels as long as the patent dispute continues 
we also incurred employee separation costs of approximately  during there were no employee separation costs in other income other income for the year ended december  decreased to  as compared to  in this decrease was attributed to lower interest income of  in as compared to  in reflecting a decrease in investable cash balances as we used cash to support our operating activities  and lower yields 
interest income will continue to decline as our investable cash balances are reduced to support our operating activities 
gains on the sale of securities of  in partly offset this decline on interest income as compared to  in in order to meet current and planned operating requirements 
during  we incurred interest expense of  on borrowings associated with the construction of our new kerastick r manufacturing facility  which has been capitalized in property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  income taxes although we had net income for  there was no income tax expense 
the majority of the revenue we recognized in connection with the termination of the schering ag agreement had been taxable in prior years for income tax purposes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  for federal reporting purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net income loss for the year ended december   we earned net income of  or 
cents per share  as compared to a net loss of  or 
cents per share  for as a result of the termination of our former dermatology collaboration arrangement  net income for included a one time increase of approximately  excluding normal amortization recorded prior to termination  based on the acceleration of previously deferred revenue and costs  and other related adjustments for impairment 
see section entitled management s discussion and analysis overview  termination of dermatology collaboration agreement 
subsequent to  we expect to incur net losses until the successful market penetration of our first products occurs 
results of operations year ending december  as compared to revenues we recognized revenues for the year ended december  of  as compared to  in of these amounts  we earned research and development revenue of  during as compared to  in from schering ag to support our dermatology co development program

we recognized royalty revenues which were earned when the kerastick r was sold by berlex to its distributor  and were payable to us during the quarter following the quarter in which the sales were made 
we recognized supply fee revenue related to these sales when our supplier shipped the kerastick r to berlex 
product sales during also included rental income on blu u r units of approximately  there was no rental income recognized in initially  we generally leased our blu u r brand light units for use with the levulan r kerastick r 
in july  we test marketed a new program  which was then launched nationally in mid september under this program  we rented the blu u r to physicians for months with no rental payments incurred by physicians and no rental revenue recognized by us for the first months  while berlex provided physicians with a supply of kerastick r samples 
under our former agreement with schering ag  two thirds of the agreed upon dermatology research and development expenses  up to  per year for and  were reimbursed to us by schering ag 
we earned total research and development reimbursement in of  based on the agreed upon development plan and the timing of the start of the clinical trials  we were only entitled to reimbursement of  for the year ended december  the total amount of up front milestone and unrestricted grant payments received in and were recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and were recognized as income on a straight line basis over the stated term of our terminated agreement with schering ag

as of december  and  deferred inventory costs were approximately  and  research and development costs our research and development costs for the year ended december  were approximately  as compared to  in the increase for was attributable to higher third party expenditures for dermatology and internal indications coupled with increased personnel costs related to ongoing development activities

other income other income for the year ended december  was approximately  as compared to  for the increase for mainly reflected earnings on higher investable cash balances as a result of the  received from our former marketing partner during the fourth quarter of  and the full year impact of approximately  in net proceeds received from a private placement of our common stock in march net losses for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of approximately  or per share  as compared to  or per share  in these losses were within management s expectations 
related party transactions our vice president of technology and former vice president of business development are principal shareholders of lumenetics  inc  our former light device consultants 
during  we paid  for certain equipment leased under operating leases from lumenetics 
in  we purchased this equipment for  all transactions were executed at prices estimated to be fair market values 
quarterly results of operations the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively quarterly results for year ended december  march june september december total revenues     income loss from operations     net income loss     basic and diluted income loss per share quarterly results for year ended december  march june september december total revenues     loss from operations     net loss     basic and diluted loss per share liquidity and capital resources we are in a strong cash position to continue to fund our research and development activities for our levulan r pdt pd dermatology platform 
our total assets were  as of december  compared to  as of december  this decrease is attributable to the funding of net operating activities during as of december   we had inventory of  representing finished goods and raw materials  as compared to  as of december  also  as of december   we had net property and equipment of  as compared to  as of december   due primarily to construction costs associated with our new manufacturing facility 
as of december   we had accounts receivable of  as compared to  as of december   representing net sales associated with kerastick r product sales 
in addition  a receivable of  had been recorded as a current asset as of december  reflecting an amount reimbursable by our former marketing partner for research and development costs under our agreement 
for  based on the termination of this agreement  we received payments for reimbursement of research and development costs to which we were entitled prior to december  as of december   we had current liabilities of  as compared to  as of december  prior to  we had no long term debt  however  in may we entered into a secured term loan promissory note note with citizens bank of massachusetts to fund the construction of our manufacturing facility and borrowed  of a  commitment  of which the remaining amount lapsed on june  on august   we commenced monthly loan payments with fixed monthly principal payments of  plus interest  which are scheduled to continue through june  interest in the first year of the loan is based on a day libor based rate  which resulted in a interest rate for the initial year of the note 
prior to expiration of the day libor based rate for each year of the loan  we can either continue to choose a libor based rate at that time  execute a one time conversion to a fixed rate loan  or repay the loan balance 
as of december   the total outstanding loan balance is  of which  is current 
approximately  of the company s united states government securities are pledged as collateral to secure the loan 
we invest our cash in united states government securities  all of which are classified as available for sale 
these securities have an aggregate cost of  and a current aggregate market value of  as of december   resulting in a net unrealized gain on securities available for sale of  which has been included in shareholders equity 
as of december   government securities had an aggregate cost of  and an aggregate market value of  resulting in a net unrealized gain of  due to fluctuations in interest rates and depending upon the timing of our need to convert government securities into cash to meet our working capital requirements  some gains or losses could be realized 
as of december   these securities had interest rates and yields ranging from to and maturity dates ranging from january  to february  as of december   these securities had interest rates and yields ranging from to and maturity dates ranging from january  to november  we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to proceed with our current dermatology research  development  manufacturing  and marketing programs for levulan r pdt  and to fund operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future  particularly with the current reduction in research and development spending 
we have invested our funds in liquid investments  so that we will have ready access to these cash reserves  as needed  for the funding of development plans on a short term and long term basis 
we are currently focusing our near term research and development efforts on our dermatology development program to treat baak 
as a result of the termination of our former dermatology collaboration arrangement  we have reevaluated our operations and intend to minimize research and development and related general and administrative expenditures that are not directly related to our core objectives for we also intend to invest in research  development  manufacturing  and marketing programs for levulan r pdt in support of our efforts to penetrate the marketplace with our unique levulan r pdt therapy for aks 
we may seek to expand or enhance our business by using resources to acquire by license  purchase or other arrangements  businesses  new technologies  or products  especially in pdt related areas 
however  at this time  we intend to focus primarily on increasing the sales of dermatology products  and on seeking a partner to help develop and market levulan r pdt for the treatment of dysplasia in patients with barrett s esophagus 
full development and testing of all potential indications would require additional funding 
the timing of expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including the level of sales of our first products including the success of our marketing programs based on reacquiring the rights to levulan r pdt  progress of our research and development programs  the results of preclinical and clinical trials  the timing of regulatory marketing approvals  competitive developments  the results of patent disputes  any new additional collaborative arrangements  if any  we may enter  and the availability of other financing 
we cannot accurately predict the magnitude of revenues from sales of our products 
while the net proceeds of the january and march common stock offerings coupled with payments received from our former marketing partner will enable us to maintain our current research program as planned and support the commercialization of levulan r pdt for aks for the foreseeable future  in order to maintain and expand continuing research and development programs  we may need to raise additional funds through future corporate alliances  financings  or other sources  depending upon the amount of revenues we receive from our first product 
additionally  we may have to establish a marketing capability  also at significant expense 
as of december   we had full time employees 
our staffing levels for key management personnel in administrative  financial  technical and operations functions had been established to support the sales levels of levulan r pdt that did not materialize 
however  following the reacquisition of our product rights  we downsized our staffing levels by approximately 
also  during the fourth quarter of  both our vice president of regulatory affairs and vice president of business development ended their employment with us  however  they are consulting on a part time  as needed  basis 
we have employment agreements with our key executive officers 
we have purchased and are the named beneficiary of a key man life insurance contract having a face value of cdn  on the life of our president 
we have incurred certain environmental control costs as part of our development of a production line for kerastick r manufacturing to ensure that our facility complies with environmental standards 
we have estimated that the capital costs to develop this facility  including equipment  will be approximately  most of which has been expended 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future  or any assurance that our operations  business or assets will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations 
see section entitled business government regulation

in august  we entered into a year lease for our new toronto location 
in october  we also entered into a new year lease at our valhalla location  and have the ability to terminate the valhalla lease after the rd year 
the operating lease obligations disclosed above include payments for the non cancelable term of all operating leases 
we have estimated that the proposed development  including clinical studies relating to a broader levulan r pdt ak treatment  rather than individual ak lesions  to the face and scalp could cost approximately  with  and  expected to be incurred in and  respectively 
we will be in a better position to estimate this commitment as we work with the fda to determine the necessary protocols 
in addition to the obligations disclosed above  we have contracted with therapeutics  inc  a clinical research organization  to manage the clinical development of our products in the field of dermatology 
this organization has the opportunity for additional stock grants  bonuses  and other incentives for each product indication ranging from  to  depending on the regulatory phase of development of products under therapeutics management 
we commenced the construction of a kerastick r manufacturing facility at our wilmington  massachusetts location in january the initial build out was completed in june  and we commenced facility qualification  process validation  and drug product stability testing  which is expected to take approximately months and be completed in early fda review and approval is also expected to take months  with an estimated completion date in late this review process should commence after the completion of all validation and certain stability activities  as well as the preparation and submission of an nda supplement 
we have estimated that the cost to build and complete testing of this facility  including equipment  will be approximately  this cost includes estimates to build the facility and all costs of construction  calibration  validation testing and equipment 
as of december   the company has capitalized  for this facility 
in may  we entered into a secured term loan promissory note note with citizens bank of massachusetts to fund the construction of its manufacturing facility and borrowed  with fixed monthly principal payments of  plus interest  which are scheduled to continue through june  recently issued accounting guidance in august  the fasb issued sfas no

the provisions of eitf no 
are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we will evaluate multiple element arrangements in accordance with this eitf upon its effective date for new arrangements into which it enters 
inflation although inflation rates have been comparatively low in recent years  inflation is expected to apply upward pressure on our operating costs 
we have included an inflation factor in our cost estimates 
however  the overall net effect of inflation on our operations is expected to be minimal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we hold fixed income united states government securities that are subject to interest rate market risks 
however  we do not believe that the risk is material as we make our investments in relatively short term instruments and we strive to match the maturity dates of these instruments to our cash flow needs 
a decline in the average yield of these instruments would reduce interest income by approximately  based on our december  balance in us government securities 
we currently have exposure to interest rate risk under a secured term loan promissory note which we issued to fund the construction of our manufacturing facility 
interest on this loan is at a libor based rate  and calls for an annual renewal on june th of each year through june  to either the applicable libor based rate or a one time conversion to a fixed rate loan 
the current loan rate is based on a libor rate of libor is at december  
our exposure to interest rate risk due to changes in libor is not expected to be material
