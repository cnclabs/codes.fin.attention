we manufacture and deliver high quality graphite and carbon electrodes and cathodes  used primarily in electric arc furnace steel production and aluminum smelting 
we also manufacture other natural and synthetic graphite and carbon products used in  and provide services to  the fuel cell power generation  electronics  semiconductor  transportation  chemical and petrochemical markets 
we have over years of experience in the research and development of graphite and carbon technology  and currently hold numerous patents related to this technology 
we believe that our electrode and cathode businesses have the leading market shares in the world 
we are a global business  selling our products and engineering and technical services in more than countries 
we have manufacturing facilities strategically located in brazil  mexico  south africa  france  spain  russia and the us our customers include industry leaders such as nucor corporation and arcelor in steel  alcoa inc and pechiney in aluminum  ballard power systems inc in fuel cells  intel corporation in electronics  memc electronic materials in semiconductors and the boeing company in transportation 
our core competencies include graphite and carbon material sciences and high temperature processing know how 
we believe that we operate industry leading research  development and testing facilities 
we also have strategic alliances with pechiney  the world leader in aluminum smelting technology  ballard power systems  the world leader in pem fuel cell technology  and leaders in the electronic thermal management and other industries 
in  our businesses were organized around two operating divisions  our graphite power systems division  which included our graphite electrode and cathode businesses  and our advanced energy technology division  which included our natural graphite  advanced synthetic graphite and advanced carbon materials businesses 
in  we further refined the organization of our businesses into three lines of business o a synthetic graphite line of business called graphite power systems  which primarily serves the steel  aluminum  semiconductor and transportation industries and includes graphite electrodes  cathodes and other advanced synthetic graphite materials  o a natural graphite line of business called advanced energy technology  which primarily serves the transportation  power generation  electronics and chemical industries and includes fuel cell  electronic thermal management and sealant products and services  and o a carbon materials line of business called advanced carbon materials  which primarily serves the silicon metal and ferro alloy industries and includes carbon electrodes and refractories 
we believe that our new organizational structure better aligns our advantaged manufacturing platform with market opportunities and enables accelerated decision making to respond to those opportunities 
under this organizational structure  we have begun to further streamline our operations 
we are implementing voluntary and selective severance programs and revising our compensation programs to strengthen our business strategies 
a main component of our compensation programs is a direct link between cash incentive compensation and cash profitability of our businesses 
our management team has actively repositioned our manufacturing network  improved product quality  reduced costs  reduced debt and other obligations  and managed antitrust liabilities 
we have also implemented an enterprise wide risk management process whereby we assess the business risks to our goal of maximizing cash flow  using a structured and disciplined approach 
this approach seeks to align our people and processes with our critical strategic uncertainties so that our management team and gti s board of directors may better evaluate and manage those uncertainties 
cost reduction plans overview 
gti s board of directors adopted a global restructuring and rationalization plan in september that delivered recurring annualized run rate cost savings of million by the end of in january  we announced a major cost savings plan that is one of the most aggressive major cost reduction plans being implemented in the graphite and carbon industry 
plan 
the key elements of the plan consist of o the rationalization of graphite electrode manufacturing capacity at our higher cost facilities and the incremental expansion of capacity at our lower cost facilities  o the redesign and implementation of changes in our us benefit plans for active and retired employees  o the implementation of global work process changes  including the consolidation and streamlining of order fulfillment  purchasing  finance and accounting  and human resource processes  along with the identification and implementation of outsourcing opportunities  o the implementation of additional plant and corporate overhead cost reduction projects  and o the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries to generate significant tax savings 
as part of the plan  we mothballed our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in caserta  italy during the first quarter  ahead of schedule 
these operations had the capacity to manufacture  metric tons of graphite electrodes annually 
after the shutdown of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in clarksville and columbia  tennessee in the third quarter  these operations were our highest cost graphite electrode manufacturing operations 
we expect to further incrementally expand graphite electrode manufacturing capacity at our facilities in mexico  france and spain during after the mothballing and incremental expansion  our total annual graphite electrode manufacturing capacity will remain about  metric tons 
during the second quarter  we launched the expansion at our facility in monterrey  mexico  which will increase its capacity from about  metric tons to about  metric tons annually 
we completed  metric tons of expansion at this facility by the end of we expect to complete the remaining expansion by the end of the first quarter 
we have identified a number of additional plant and overhead cost reduction projects 
one of our major projects is employee benefit plan redesign 
in the fourth quarter and first quarter  we redesigned and implemented changes in our retiree medical insurance plan and our us retirement and savings plans for active and retired employees 
among other things  we froze our qualified defined benefit plan and established a new defined contribution plan for most of our us employees 
these changes resulted in annual cost savings of million in and million in and will result in annual recurring cost savings of more than million in and later years 
in addition  on july   we amended our us post retirement medical coverage 
effective march   we will discontinue the medicare supplement plan for retirees years or older or those eligible for medicare benefits 
this change will apply to all current employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement  all current retirees who were not covered by a collective bargaining agreement when they retired and those retirees who retired under a former collective bargaining agreement 
this change is expected to reduce our net post retirement medical benefit obligation by about million 
the reduction will be amortized over the remaining life of the retiree population 
effective march   we will freeze our qualified defined benefit plan for our remaining us employees 
we are also implementing voluntary and selective severance programs 
these programs are designed to compliment our global work process and organizational redesign 
from through  we reduced our global workforce by about  employees or 
the voluntary and selective severance programs are expected to result in the reduction of our global workforce by up to an additional employees or about 
the voluntary severance program requires election by eligible participants by march  these programs may require up to million of restructuring charges throughout  approximately million of which are expected to be cash 
these programs are expected to result in annual cost savings of million in and annual recurring cost savings of million in and are part of our annual recurring cost saving targets discussed below 
the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries was substantially completed in the first half and resulted in substantial tax savings 
as a result of the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries  the effective income tax rate for  excluding non recurring charges or benefits associated with the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries  was about 
we intend to sell real estate  non strategic businesses and certain other non strategic assets over the next two years 
we anticipate that the aggregate estimated pre tax  cash proceeds from these sales will total million 
we are targeting recurring annual pre tax cost savings of million in  million in and million in  which is later than previously expected due to a variety of factors 
these factors include the sale of higher cost inventories associated with low operating levels in early  higher than planned costs associated with activities to transition graphite electrode production capacity from our higher cost facilities to our lower cost facilities  including the sourcing of graphite electrodes from other producers and extended preparations at our existing facilities to run at capacity  and impacts of net changes in currency exchange rates 
savings achieved under the plan are additive to those which we achieved by the end of under the plan that is now completed 
we achieved cost savings of about million in we believe that implementation of the plan will require about million of cash exit costs excluding taxes  of which about million has been recorded through approximately million of the million has been paid through the plan is expected to result in about million of non cash restructuring charges and impairment losses on long lived assets  of which about million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
in addition  in the first quarter  we recorded a million restructuring charge that related primarily to the mothballing of our italian graphite electrode manufacturing operations under the plan and an additional million in the fourth quarter 
this charge includes estimated pension  severance and other related employee benefit costs for employees and other mothballing costs 
the remaining actions associated with the plan  primarily the implementation of global work process changes and additional overhead cost reductions  could result in additional restructuring charges 
plan 
the key elements of our global restructuring and rationalization plan announced in september and enhanced in october included the shutdown of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations at our facilities in canada and germany and the downsizing of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations at our facilities in russia 
as a result of the plan and other cost savings initiatives  we reduced our average graphite electrode production cost per metric ton by the end of by since the fourth quarter 
other cost savings activities 
since  we have initiated other cost savings activities 
some of these activities will continue while the plan is being implemented 
we began to implement in and are continuing to implement a global business process rationalization and transformation initiative 
through december   our investment in the initiative included about million of consulting fees and internal costs and million of capital expenditures  primarily for costs related to implementation of global information technology systems for advanced planning and scheduling software and global treasury management systems 
we have evaluated every aspect of our supply chain and improved and continue to improve performance through realignment and standardization of supply chain processes and systems and improvement of interfaces with trading partners 
effective april  we entered into a ten year service contract with cgi group inc valued at million 
pursuant to this contract  cgi became the delivery arm for our global information technology service requirements  including the design and implementation of our global information and advanced manufacturing and demand planning processes  using jd edwards software 
through this contract  we are seeking to transform our information technology service capability into an efficient  high quality enabler for our global supply chain initiatives as well as a contributor to our cost reduction activities 
under the outsourcing provisions of this contract  cgi manages our data center services  networks  desktops  telecommunications and legacy systems 
through this contract  we believe that we will be able to leverage the resources of cgi to assist us in achieving our information technology goals and our cost savings targets 
in the third quarter  we entered into a ten year outsourcing contract with cgi group inc valued at million 
pursuant to this contract  cgi became the delivery arm for our finance and accounting business process services  including accounts receivable and accounts payable activities 
cgi also provides various related analytical services such as general accounting  cost accounting and financial analysis activities 
through this contract  we believe that we will be able to further leverage the resources of cgi to assist us in achieving our cost savings targets 
strategic alliances we are pursuing strategic alliances that enhance or complement our existing or related businesses 
strategic alliances may be in the form of joint venture  licensing  supply or other arrangements 
we have developed a strategic alliance in the cathode business with pechiney  the world s recognized leader in aluminum smelting technology 
to broaden our alliance  in march  we contributed our brazilian cathode manufacturing operations to carbone savoie 
pechiney  the minority owner of carbone savoie  contributed approximately million in cash to carbone savoie as part of this transaction 
the cash contribution was used to upgrade manufacturing operations in brazil and france  which was completed by the end of the first quarter 
ownership in carbone savoie remains by us and by pechiney 
under our now broadened alliance  carbone savoie holds our entire cathode manufacturing capacity 
in april  we entered into a joint venture with jilin to produce and sell high quality graphite electrodes in china 
if successfully implemented  the joint venture would utilize renovated capacity at jilin s main facility in jilin city and complete additions at another facility in changchun that were begun by jilin 
we are required to make capital contributions of million of cash million of which has been contributed to date plus technical assistance million of which has been contributed to date for our ownership interest in the joint venture 
the successful implementation and completion of the parties capital contributions to the joint venture is subject to the receipt of required chinese governmental approvals and satisfaction of other conditions 
during the fourth quarter  we impaired our total investments to date of million associated with this joint venture with jilin 
this impairment results from uncertainty about the completion and start up of the facilities in changchun  china due to the effects that the challenging graphite electrode industry conditions have had on jilin 
we continue to work closely with jilin on production alternatives 
however  we will make no further contributions to the joint venture until we have agreed upon production alternatives 
we have been working with ballard power systems since on developing natural graphite based materials for use in its fuel cells for power generation 
in june  our subsidiary  aet  entered into an expanded exclusive development and collaboration agreement and an expanded exclusive long term supply agreement with ballard power systems 
in addition  ballard power systems became a strategic investor in aet  investing million valued at the time of investment in shares of ballard power systems common stock for a equity ownership interest in aet 
the scope of the expanded exclusive development and collaboration agreement includes natural graphite based materials and components  including flow field plates and gas diffusion layers  for use in pem fuel cells and fuel cell systems for transportation  stationary and portable applications 
the initial term of this agreement extends through under the new supply agreement  we will be the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of natural graphite based materials for ballard power systems fuel cells and fuel cell systems 
we will also be the exclusive manufacturer of natural graphite based components  other than those components that ballard power systems manufactures for itself 
the initial term of this agreement  which contains customary terms and conditions  extends through we have the right to manufacture and sell  after agreed upon release dates  natural graphite based materials and components for use in pem fuel cells to other parties in the fuel cell industry 
global economic conditions and outlook we are impacted in varying degrees  both positively and negatively  as global  regional or country conditions fluctuate 
economic weakening in north america continued and became more severe in this economic weakness was exacerbated by the impact on economic conditions of the terrorist acts in the us in september many steel companies in the us were subject to or filed for protection under the us bankruptcy code 
electric arc furnace steel production declined in as compared to by about in the us the economic weakness in north america adversely impacted economic conditions in europe  asia except for china  brazil and other regions  and this impact became more severe during electric arc furnace steel production declined in as compared to by about in asia excluding china and in brazil 
the decline of electric arc furnace steel production in brazil was caused both by shortages of electricity brought on by a drought that reduced hydroelectric power generation that have been largely relieved in as well as by the weakening in global economic conditions 
brazil was also impacted by developing currency  debt and related economic crises in brazil itself as well as in neighboring argentina 
electric arc furnace steel production in china remained relatively stable 
worldwide electric arc furnace steel production declined by about in to a total of about million metric tons  about of total steel production as compared to these fluctuations in electric arc furnace steel production resulted in corresponding fluctuations to a greater or lesser extent  depending on economic conditions affecting  and decisions by  electric arc furnace steel producers in demand for graphite electrodes 
we estimate that worldwide graphite electrode demand declined in as compared to by about 
overall pricing worldwide was weak throughout most of this period 
while we implemented increases in local currency selling prices of our graphite electrodes in and early in europe  the asia pacific region  the middle east and south africa  we were not able to maintain all of these price increases 
we have been experiencing intense competition in the graphite electrode industry 
one of our us competitors  the carbide graphite group  inc  filed for protection under the us bankruptcy code in october in order to seek to minimize our credit risks  we reduced our sales of  or refused to sell except for cash on delivery  graphite electrodes to some customers and potential customers in the us and  to a limited extent  elsewhere 
our unpaid trade receivables from steel companies in the us that have filed for protection under the us bankruptcy code since january  have aggregated only of net sales of graphite electrodes in the us during the period from january  through december  our volume of graphite electrodes sold declined in as compared to by about due primarily to the decline in electric arc furnace steel production as well as our efforts to implement and maintain local currency selling price increases and our efforts to seek to minimize credit risks 
the global and regional economic conditions that impacted demand and prices for graphite electrodes also impacted demand and prices for most of our other products sold to the metals  transportation and other industries other than graphite cathodes 
in general  demand was relatively stable and pricing remained relatively weak 
demand and prices for graphite cathodes remained relatively strong primarily due to construction of new aluminum smelters using graphite cathodes  even as old smelters using carbon cathodes are removed from service 
global economic conditions remained relatively weak in however  electric arc furnace steel production rebounded from the depressed level in we estimate that worldwide electric arc furnace steel production increased by about in to a total of about million metric tons  about of total steel production as compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase in production in the us and china and  to a limited extent  in mexico and asia other than china 
in march  president bush announced his decision to impose tariffs  of up to initially and declining thereafter over a three year period  on most imported steel as part of a broader plan to rescue the financially troubled steel industry in the us several additional exemptions were granted in by the bush administration 
we believe that the tariffs are having a modest positive impact on electric arc furnace steel production in the us while steel imported from mexico is exempt from those tariffs  steel imported from europe and asia is not exempt 
steel production in those regions has been adversely impacted by the tariffs 
further  import duties in china on both steel and graphite electrodes have declined as a result of the admission of china to the world trade organization 
we cannot predict whether and to what extent these developments will impact our global business over the long term 
however  the us section tariffs will remain in place through  and china has extended its temporary tariff into worldwide graphite electrode demand was very depressed in the first quarter  but rebounded from those depressed levels during the balance of we utilized virtually of our graphite electrode manufacturing capacity during the last three quarters of and our volume of graphite electrodes sold increased about in from overall  we believe that worldwide graphite electrode demand increased modestly in as compared to while we attempted to implement increases in local currency selling prices of our graphite electrodes in  we believe that graphite electrode pricing declined by about in average dollar terms in as compared to  driven by supply demand imbalance as well as global and industry economic conditions 
weak economic conditions in resulted in relatively low demand and weak pricing for our other products sold to metals  transportation and other industries other than graphite cathodes 
we used virtually of our cathode manufacturing capacity during and our volume of cathodes sold increased about in from demand and prices for cathodes remained strong primarily due to construction of new aluminum smelters using graphite cathodes  even as old smelters using carbon cathodes are removed from service 
outlook 
we believe that the rebound we experienced in graphite electrode demand from the depressed level in the first quarter was primarily due to the improvement in conditions in the steel industry and an increase in our market share as we continue to implement our enterprise selling and other strategies 
we are now seeing the building of steel inventory levels  especially in the us our graphite electrode order book is about full for and our cathode order book is virtually full for we announced  effective for new orders placed after february  price increases of euro per metric ton for our graphite electrodes sold in europe  per metric ton for our graphite electrodes sold in asia  the middle east  north africa and south america and per pound for our graphite electrodes sold in the us we cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain such price increases without adversely affecting sales volume 
we plan to continue to operate our plants at capacity to meet demand  which is expected to positively impact average graphite electrode and cathode production cost per metric ton in as compared to the in addition  we also expect to benefit from the impact of our prior and current plant rationalization activities  cost activities and cost reduction programs as well as increased economies of scale 
we believe that business conditions for most of our products other than graphite electrodes and cathodes will remain challenging well into in particular  demand for carbon electrodes in the us where our main customer base is located and demand for advanced graphite and carbon material products used in semiconductor  telecommunication and electronic industries is depressed 
accordingly  we expect the financial performance of our businesses selling those products to remain similar to levels 
we will continue to seek to drive productivity improvements in these businesses through our cost savings initiatives 
we continue to focus on commercializing new technologies 
in our natural graphite line of business  we are seeking to commercialize approximately active egraf tm thermal management product development programs that are currently underway 
approximately half of these programs are already in the product testing phase 
we are focused on delivering significant improvement in earnings and cash flow in over we are expecting improvements in graphite electrode sales volumes and prices as well as costs 
for example  we have implemented graphite electrode price increases in average dollar terms for and expect an increase in volume of graphite electrodes sold of about in over we have implemented interest rate management initiatives to seek to minimize our interest expense and optimize our portfolio of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
in the second quarter  we entered into two ten year interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of million to effectively convert that amount of fixed rate debt represented by senior notes to variable rate debt 
these swaps reduced our interest expense in by million 
in the third quarter  we reset our interest rate swaps to allow the accelerated collection of million in cash 
in the first quarter  we entered into an additional ten year interest rate swap for a notional amount of million that effectively converted that amount of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
in the first quarter  we also entered into five year interest rate caps for a notional amount of million 
subsequently in the first quarter  we sold the entire million notional amount of our interest rate swaps for million in cash 
the adjustment of the carrying amount of the senior notes will be amortized over the term of the senior notes and recorded as a credit against interest expense 
we are targeting interest expense of to million for  essentially the same as in following the sale of the swaps  in march  we entered into million notional amount of interest rate swaps through the remaining term of our senior notes 
our outlook could be significantly impacted by  among other things  changes in interest rates by the us federal reserve board and the european central bank  changes in tax and fiscal policies by the us and other governments  developments involving a war against iraq  the occurrence of further terrorist acts and developments including increases in security  insurance  data back up  transportation and other costs  transportation delays and continuing or increased economic uncertainty and weakness resulting from terrorist acts and the war on terrorism  and changes in global and regional economic conditions 
financing transactions senior note offerings 
on february   we completed a private offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes at a price of of principal amount 
on may   we completed a private offering of million aggregate principal amount of additional senior notes at a price of of principal amount  plus accrued interest from february  the senior notes bear interest at an annual rate of and mature in the net proceeds from the offering completed in february were million 
the net proceeds excluding accrued interest paid by the purchasers of the senior notes from the offering completed in may were million 
we used all of these net proceeds to reduce the balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility and to repay term loans under the senior facilities 
we paid approximately million of debt issuance costs related to the senior notes sold in february and million related to the senior notes sold in may these costs are being amortized over the term of the senior notes 
the million premium received upon issuance of the additional senior notes issued in may is classified as long term liability on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized as a credit to interest expense over the term of the additional senior notes 
as a result of our receipt of such premium  the effective annual interest rate on the additional senior notes is about 
at december   the senior facilities constituted million of our total debt of million including million for unamortized bond premium and million for fair value of hedged debt obligations  of which million was borrowings under term loans and all of the scheduled principal payments of which term loans are due in we obtained consent from the holders of the senior notes issued in february to amend the indenture so as to waive the requirement to use the gross proceeds from the issuance of the additional senior notes issued in may to make intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries and  on april   entered into a supplemental indenture to give effect to such amendment 
we recorded an extraordinary charge of million million after tax in the first quarter and an extraordinary charge of million million after tax in the second quarter for write off of capitalized fees associated with the term loans under senior facilities repaid with the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes 
in november  moody s investor service reduced its rating on the senior notes from b to b moody s confirmed its ba rating on the senior facilities 
public equity offering 
in july  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds from that offering were million 
of the net proceeds were used to repay term loans under the senior facilities 
the balance of the net proceeds will be used to fund growth and expansion of our natural graphite line of business  including growth through acquisitions  and  pending such use  has been applied to reduce outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility 
debt recapitalization 
in february  we completed a debt recapitalization and obtained the senior facilities 
the senior facilities consist of a six year term loan facility in the initial amounts of million and euro million  an eight year term loan facility in the initial amount of million and a six year revolving credit facility in the initial maximum amount of euro million 
the senior facilities have been amended as described elsewhere in this report 
we recorded an extraordinary charge of million  net of tax  in connection with our debt recapitalization 
the charge includes the redemption premium on our previously outstanding senior subordinated notes  bank  legal  accounting  filing and other fees and expenses  and write off of deferred issuance costs 
litigation against our former parent companies initiated by us in february  we commenced a lawsuit against our former parents  mitsubishi corporation and union carbide corporation 
in the lawsuit  we allege  among other things  that certain payments made to our former parents in connection with our leveraged equity recapitalization in january were unlawful  that our former parents were unjustly enriched by receipts from their investments in us and that our former parents aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duties owed to us by our former senior management in connection with illegal graphite electrode price fixing activities 
we are seeking to recover more than billion in damages  including interest 
some of our claims provide for joint and several liability  however  damages from our various claims would not generally be additive to each other 
the defendants have filed motions to dismiss this lawsuit 
oral hearings were held on those motions in the first quarter 
the court has not ruled on these motions 
we expect to incur million to million for legal expenses to pursue this lawsuit from the date of filing the complaint through trial 
through december   we had incurred about million of these legal expenses 
this lawsuit is in its earliest stages  and the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit is subject to many uncertainties 
antitrust and other litigation against us since  we and other producers and distributors of graphite and carbon products have been subject to antitrust investigations by antitrust authorities in the us  the european union  canada  japan and korea 
in addition  civil antitrust lawsuits have been commenced and threatened against us and other producers and distributors of graphite and carbon products in the us  canada and elsewhere 
we recorded a pre tax charge against results of operations for in the amount of million as a reserve for estimated potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
in april  gti pled guilty to a one count charge of violating us federal antitrust law in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes and was sentenced to pay a non interest bearing fine in the aggregate amount of million  payable in six annual installments of million  million  million  million  million and million  commencing july  the payments due in  and were timely made 
in january  at our request  the due date of each of the remaining three payments was deferred by one year and  at our request  in january  the payment schedule for the million unpaid balance outstanding at that time was revised to million payment in april  a million payment in april and  beginning in april  quarterly payments ranging from million to million through january the payment due in was timely made 
beginning in  the us department of justice may ask the court to accelerate the payment schedule based on a change in our ability to make such payments 
interest will begin to accrue on the unpaid balance  commencing in april  at the statutory rate of interest then in effect 
at december   the statutory rate of interest was per annum 
accrued interest will be payable together with each quarterly payment 
of the million aggregate amount  million is treated as a fine and million is treated as imputed interest for accounting purposes 
in  and  investigations by the antitrust authorities in canada  japan and korea were resolved 
in january  the eu competition authority issued a statement of objections initiating proceedings against us and other producers of graphite electrodes 
the statement alleged that we and other producers violated european antitrust laws in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes 
in july  that authority issued its decision regarding the allegations and assessed a fine of euro million million  based on currency exchange rates in effect at december  against gti 
as a result of the assessment of this fine  we recorded a pre tax charge of million against results of operations in the second quarter as an additional reserve for a total of million for potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
this decision has brought to a conclusion our last major antitrust liability 
from the initiation of its investigation  we have cooperated with the eu competition authority 
as a result of our cooperation  this fine reflects a substantial reduction from the amount that otherwise would have been assessed 
it is the policy of eu competition authority to negotiate appropriate terms of payment of antitrust fines  including extended payment terms 
we have had discussions regarding payment terms 
after an in depth analysis of the decision  in october  we filed an appeal to the court challenging the amount of the fine 
the fine or collateral security therefor would typically be required to be paid or provided at about the time the appeal was filed 
we are currently in discussions with eu competition authority regarding the appropriate form of collateral security during the pendency of the appeal 
if the results of these discussions are not acceptable to us  we may file an interim appeal to the court to waive the requirement for collateral security or to allow us to provide alternative security for payment 
we cannot predict how or when the court would rule on such an interim appeal 
in the second quarter  we became aware that the brazilian antitrust authority had requested written information from various steelmakers in brazil 
in april  our brazilian subsidiary received a request for information from that authority 
we have provided that information 
in may  the eu competition authority issued a statement of objections initiating proceedings against us and other producers of specialty graphite 
the statement alleges that we and other producers violated european antitrust laws in connection with the sale of specialty graphite 
in december  the eu competition authority issued its decision regarding the allegations 
under the decision  the eu competition authority assessed no fine against us due to our cooperation 
we are continuing to cooperate with the us  european and canadian antitrust authorities in their continuing investigations of others 
it is possible that antitrust investigations seeking  among other things  to impose fines and penalties could be initiated against us by authorities in brazil or other jurisdictions 
we have settled  among others  virtually all of the actual and potential claims against us by customers in the us and canada arising out of alleged antitrust violations occurring prior to the date of the relevant settlement in connection with the sale of graphite electrodes 
all settlement payments due have been timely made 
none of the settlement or plea agreements contain restrictions on future prices of our graphite electrodes 
there remain  however  certain pending claims as well as pending lawsuits in the us relating to the sale of bulk graphite as well as the sale of graphite electrodes sold to foreign customers 
it is also possible that additional antitrust lawsuits and claims could be asserted against us in the us or other jurisdictions 
through december   we have paid an aggregate of million of fines and net settlement and expense payments and million of imputed interest 
at december   million remained in the reserve 
the balance of the reserve is available for the balance of the fine payable by us to the us department of justice excluding imputed interest thereon  the fine assessed against us by the eu competition authority and other matters 
the aggregate amount of remaining committed payments payable to the us department of justice for imputed interest at december  was about million 
we cannot assure you that remaining liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims will not materially exceed the remaining uncommitted balance of the reserve or that the timing of payment thereof will not be sooner than anticipated 
in the aggregate  the fines and net settlements and expenses are within the amounts we used to evaluate the million charge 
to the extent that aggregate liabilities and expenses  net  are known or reasonably estimable  million represents our estimate of these liabilities and expenses 
the guilty pleas and the decisions by the antitrust authorities make it more difficult to defend against other investigations  lawsuits and claims 
our insurance has not and will not materially cover liabilities that have or may become due in connection with antitrust investigations or related lawsuits or claims 
customer base we are a global company and serve all major geographic markets 
sales of our products to customers outside the us accounted for about of our net sales in  of our net sales in and of our net sales in our customer base includes both steel makers and non steel makers 
in  two of our ten largest customers were purchasers of non graphite electrode products 
in  four of our ten largest customers were based in europe  two were in the us  two were in south africa and one was in each of mexico and brazil 
no single customer or group of affiliated customers accounted for more than of our net sales in financial effects of organizational changes in  we realigned our businesses into two operating divisions  the graphite power systems division and advanced energy technology division  each of which constituted a reportable segment 
in  we reorganized our businesses into three lines of business  synthetic graphite  natural graphite and carbon materials 
these three lines of business constitute two reportable segments  synthetic graphite and other 
the following table sets forth  for periods indicated  certain items in the consolidated statements of operations and certain information as to gross profit margins  related to our reportable segments

gross profit in was million  a decrease of million  or  from gross profit in of million 
gross profit margin in was of net sales as compared to gross profit margin in of of net sales 
the decrease in net sales and gross profit was primarily due to lower sales revenue per metric ton for our graphite electrodes  which reduced net sales by about million 
former graphite power systems segment 
net sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes  partially offset by higher sales volumes for graphite electrodes and cathodes sold 
the volume of graphite electrodes sold increased  metric tons  or  to  metric tons in as compared to  metric tons in the increase in volume of graphite electrodes sold represented an increase in net sales of about million 
the average sales revenue per metric ton in us dollars and net changes in currency exchange rates of our graphite electrodes was  in as compared to  in the reduced average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes represented a decrease of about million in net sales 
unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates represented a reduction of about million in net sales of graphite electrodes 
volume of cathodes sold in was higher than in  with  metric tons in as compared to  metric tons in  and net sales of cathodes in were higher than in we completed the expansion of our cathode manufacturing capacity in brazil in and were successful in selling virtually all of our cathode manufacturing capacity for graphite electrodes cost of sales increased  or million  to million in from million in the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher volume of graphite electrodes sold  partially offset by lower average graphite electrode cost of sales per metric ton 
the reduction in average graphite electrode cost of sales per metric ton was primarily due to cost savings initiatives and lower average fixed cost per metric ton due to facility closures and  to lesser extent  changes in currency exchange rates 
gross profit decreased  or million  to million of net sales in from million of net sales in former advanced energy technology segment 
net sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in we had lower net sales in each of our product lines  especially in advanced carbon materials due to a cyclical decrease in the volume of refractories sold  in advanced graphite materials due to lower sales of products to customers in the aerospace  semiconductor and industrial sectors and in flexible graphite due to lower sales of sealing products sold to the transportation industry 
cost of sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decline was primarily due to lower volume of products sold 
gross profit decreased  or million  to million of net sales in from million of net sales in other items affecting us as a whole 
selling  administrative and other expense was stable at million in each of and other income expense  net was million of income in as compared to million of expense in we recorded both other income and other expense in both periods resulting from various non operational activities  including gains from currency transactions and translation 
in  we had million in currency gains  million of which gain was due to currency translation on intercompany loans and translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which use the dollar as their functional currency and million of which related to transactions with third parties 
these gains were offset by other expenses  including legal expenses and settlements  financing costs and costs associated with the curtailment of employee benefit plans 
in  we recorded a total of million in impairment losses and restructuring charges as described below o in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million million after tax charge relating to the impairment of our investment in our joint venture with jilin 
the impairment results from uncertainty about the completion and start up of the planned graphite electrode facility in changchun  china due to the effects that the challenging graphite electrode industry conditions have had on jilin 
o in the second and third quarters  we recorded a total of million of charges related to the impairment of available for sale securities 
o in the second quarter  we recorded a million million after tax charge primarily related to the impairment of our long lived carbon electrode assets in columbia  tennessee as a result of a decline in demand and loss of market share 
the primary end market for carbon electrodes is silicon metal  which was very depressed in the us where our main customer base is located 
o in the first and fourth quarter  we recorded a total of million of restructuring charges related primarily to the mothballing of our graphite electrode operations in caserta  italy 
these charges included estimated pension  severance and other related employee benefit costs 
in addition  in  we recorded a million charge related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock and million in corporate realignment and related expenses 
in  we recorded a total of million  net  in impairment losses and restructuring charges as described below o in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million restructuring charge and a million impairment loss on long lived and other assets 
the restructuring charge related primarily to exit costs related to the mothballing of our graphite electrode operations in caserta  italy 
million of the impairment loss on long lived assets related to assets located at our facility in caserta  italy 
the remaining million related to the impairment of available for sale securities 
o in the third quarter  we recorded a million restructuring charge and impairment loss on long lived assets related to a corporate realignment of our businesses  the relocation of our corporate headquarters and the shutdown of our coal calcining operations located in niagara falls  new york 
the charge includes severance and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction of employees and impairment of leasehold improvement assets 
o in third quarter  we reversed million of prior restructuring charges based on revised lower estimates of workforce reductions and plant closure costs  and we reclassified million of prior restructuring charges related to on site waste disposal post monitoring costs to other long term obligations 
o in the second quarter  we recorded a million charge for restructuring and impairment loss on long lived assets related to the shutdown of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in clarksville and columbia  tennessee and our coal calcining operations in niagara falls  new york 
the million charge includes restructuring charges of million for severance and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction of employees and million in plant shutdown and related costs 
the remaining million relates to the impairment loss on long lived assets 
in addition  in  we recorded a million charge for additional potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims as well as million in corporate realignment and related expenses 
interest expense was stable at million in each of and our average outstanding total debt was million in as compared to million in and our average annual interest rate was in as compared to in these average annual interest rates exclude imputed interest on antitrust fines  which decreased million to million in from million in benefit from income taxes was million in as compared to provision for income taxes of million for during both and  the benefit from and provision for income taxes reflected an effective rate of about  excluding the impact of impairment losses on long lived and other assets  restructuring charges  the charge related to antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims  and the charge related to the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries 
as a result of the changes described above  net loss was million in  an improvement of million from net loss of million in compared to net sales in were million  a decrease of million  or  from net sales in of million 
gross profit in was million  a decrease of million  or  from gross profit in of million 
gross profit margin in was of net sales as compared to gross profit margin in of of net sales 
the decrease in net sales and gross profit was primarily due to lower sales volume of most of our products  particularly graphite electrodes  which reduced net sales by about million  primarily due to depressed steel industry conditions 
the increase in gross profit margin percentage was primarily due to the fact that the percentage decrease in net sales was less than the percentage decrease in cost of sales  due primarily to lower production levels and benefits from our cost savings activities 
former graphite power systems segment 
net sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes and lower volumes of graphite electrodes and cathodes sold 
the volume of graphite electrodes sold decreased  metric tons  or  to  metric tons in from  metric tons in the decrease in volume of graphite electrodes sold represented a decrease in net sales of about million 
the decrease was primarily a result of continued lower north american steel production  weaker demand in europe and brazil and actions taken to manage credit risk 
the average sales revenue per metric ton in us dollars and net changes in currency exchange rates of our graphite electrodes was  in as compared to  in the reduced average sales revenue per metric ton of graphite electrodes represented a decrease of about million in net sales 
unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates represented a reduction of about million in net sales of graphite electrodes  more than offsetting the benefits of increases in selling prices in local currencies in certain foreign countries 
volume of cathodes sold was  metric tons in as compared to  metric tons in cost of sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to the lower volume of graphite electrodes sold and a lower average graphite electrode cost of sales per metric ton 
the reduction in average graphite electrode cost of sales per metric ton was primarily due to cost savings initiatives and lower average fixed cost per metric ton due to facility closures and  to lesser extent  changes in currency exchange rates 
gross profit decreased  or million  to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to the fact that the percentage decrease in net sales was greater than the percentage decrease in cost of sales 
former advanced energy technology segment 
net sales increased  or million  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to cyclical increases in the volume of refractories sold and sales of products to customers in the aerospace industry  new business sales and an increase in technical service and technology license fees  partially offset by a decrease in volume of flexible graphite sold for gasket applications due to lower demand from the automotive industry as well as a decrease in products sold to the semiconductor and industrial sectors 
cost of sales decreased  or million  to million in from million in the decline was primarily due to changes in product mix and cost savings initiatives 
gross profit increased  or million  to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in gross profit margin was due to the increase in net sales and decrease in cost of sales 
other items affecting us as a whole 
selling  administrative and other expense declined million to million in from million in  primarily due to reduced corporate spending 
other income expense  net was expense of million in as compared to nil in we recorded both other income and other expense in both periods resulting from various non operational activities  including gains from currency transactions and translation  that were largely offsetting 
in  we recorded a total of million  net  in impairment losses and restructuring charges as described below o in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million restructuring charge and a million impairment loss on long lived and other assets 
the restructuring charge related primarily to exit costs related to the mothballing of our graphite electrode operations in caserta  italy 
million of the impairment loss on long lived assets related to assets located at our facility in caserta  italy 
the remaining million related to the impairment of available for sale securities 
o in the third quarter  we recorded a million restructuring charge and impairment loss on long lived assets related to a corporate realignment of our businesses  the relocation of our corporate headquarters and the shutdown of our coal calcining operations located in niagara falls  new york 
the charge includes severance and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction of employees and impairment of leasehold improvement assets 
o in third quarter  we reversed million of prior restructuring charges based on revised lower estimates of workforce reductions and plant closure costs  and we reclassified million of prior restructuring charges related to on site waste disposal post monitoring costs to other long term obligations 
o in the second quarter  we recorded a million charge for restructuring and impairment loss on long lived assets related to the shutdown of our graphite electrode manufacturing operations in clarksville and columbia  tennessee and our coal calcining operations in niagara falls  new york 
the million charge includes restructuring charges of million for severance and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction of employees and million in plant shutdown and related costs 
the remaining million relates to the impairment loss on long lived assets 
in addition  in  we recorded a million charge for additional potential liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims as well as million in corporate realignment and related expenses 
in  we recorded a total of million  net  in impairment losses and restructuring charges as described below o in the fourth quarter  we recorded a charge of million in connection with a corporate restructuring  mainly for severance and related benefits associated with a workforce reduction of employees 
the functional areas affected included finance  accounting  sales  marketing and administration 
o in the third quarter  we recorded an impairment loss on long lived assets of million in connection with the re sourcing of our us cathode production to our facilities in brazil and france and the reduction of graphite electrode production capacity to accommodate such increased cathode production in brazil and france 
this cash charge related to the write off of certain long lived assets located at one of our facilities in the us o in the first quarter  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in connection with a restructuring of our advanced graphite materials business 
key elements of the restructuring included elimination of certain product lines and rationalization of operations to reduce costs and improve profitability of remaining product lines 
this rationalization included discontinuing certain manufacturing processes at one of our facilities in the us that will be performed at our other facilities in the future 
based on subsequent developments in the third quarter  we decided not to demolish certain buildings 
therefore  in the third quarter  we reversed the million of the charge related to demolition and related environmental costs 
the million balance of the charge included estimated severance costs for employees 
the restructuring was completed in in addition  in  we recorded a million write off of costs incurred in connection with a proposed initial public offering by aet that was subsequently withdrawn 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due to lower average annual interest rates and lower average total debt outstanding 
our average outstanding total debt was million in as compared to million in and our average annual interest rate was in as compared to in these average annual interest rates exclude imputed interest on antitrust fines 
provision for income taxes was million for as compared to million for during  the provision for income taxes reflected an effective rate of about  excluding the impact of impairment losses on long lived and other assets  restructuring charges  the charge related to antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims  and the charge related to the corporate realignment of our subsidiaries 
for  the provision for income taxes reflected an effective rate of about 
the increase in the effective rate in was primarily due to a higher proportion of income from higher tax jurisdictions 
as a result of the changes described above  net loss was million in  a decrease of million from net income of million in effects of inflation in general  our results of operations and financial condition are affected by the inflation in each country in which we have a manufacturing facility 
during the first half  the effects of inflation on our cost of sales in the us and foreign countries except for highly inflationary countries were generally mitigated by a combination of improved operating efficiency and permanent on going cost savings 
accordingly  during that period  these effects were not material to us 
from mid through mid  we experienced higher energy and raw material costs primarily due to the substantial increase in the worldwide market price of oil and natural gas 
during the latter part of that period  we were able to similarly mitigate the effects of those increases on our cost of sales 
we have not experienced significant inflation since mid we cannot assure that future increases in our costs will not exceed the rate of inflation or the amounts  if any  by which we may be able to increase prices for our products 
we account for our non us subsidiaries under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
accordingly  except for highly inflationary countries  the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes 
foreign currency translation adjustments are generally recorded as part of stockholders equity and identified as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets until such time as their operations are sold or substantially or completely liquidated 
prior to august   our swiss subsidiary used the dollar as its functional currency 
beginning august   our swiss subsidiary began using the euro as its functional currency because its operations became predominantly euro denominated 
foreign currency translation adjustments decreasing stockholders equity amounted to million  including million associated with our brazilian subsidiary  in  million  including million associated with our south african subsidiary  in and million  including million associated with our south african subsidiary  in we maintain operations in russia  mexico and other countries which have had in the past  and may have now or in the future  highly inflationary economies  defined as cumulative inflation of about or more over a three calendar year period 
in general  the financial statements of foreign operations in highly inflationary economies have been remeasured as if the functional currency of their economic environments were the dollar and translation gains and losses relating to these foreign operations are included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations rather than as part of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
since  we have accounted for our mexican subsidiary using the dollar as its functional currency  irrespective of mexico s inflationary status  because its sales and purchases are predominantly dollar denominated 
we have always considered russia to have a highly inflationary economy 
accordingly  we have always accounted for our russian operations using the dollar as its functional currency 
foreign currency translation gains and losses relating to these subsidiaries are included in other income expense  net 
effects of changes in currency exchange rates we incur manufacturing costs and sell our products in multiple currencies 
as a result  in general  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition are affected by changes in currency exchange rates as well as by inflation in countries with highly inflationary economies where we have manufacturing facilities 
to manage certain exposures to risks caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we use various off balance sheet financial instruments 
to account for translation of foreign currencies into dollars for consolidation and reporting purposes  we record foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as part of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets  except in the case of operations in highly inflationary economies or which use the dollar as their functional currency where we record foreign currency translation gains and losses as part of other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
we also record foreign currency transaction gains and losses as part of other income expense  net 
when the local currencies of foreign countries in which we have a manufacturing facility decline or increase in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of reducing or increasing the dollar equivalent cost of sales and other expenses with respect to those facilities 
this effect is  however  partially offset by the cost of petroleum coke  a principal raw material used by us  which is priced in dollars 
in certain countries where we have manufacturing facilities  and in certain instances where we price our products for sale in export markets  we sell in local currencies 
accordingly  when the local currencies increase or decline in value relative to the dollar  this has the effect of increasing or reducing net sales 
the result of these effects is to increase or decrease operating profit and net income 
over the past three years  many of the foreign countries in which we have a manufacturing facility  particularly brazil  have been subject to significant economic pressures  which have impacted inflation and currency exchange rates affecting those countries 
as a result  many of the currencies in which we manufacture and sell our products weakened against the dollar 
during  the brazilian real declined about  the south african rand increased about  and the euro increased about 
during  the euro declined about  the brazilian real declined about and the south african rand declined about 
during  the south african rand declined about  the euro declined about and the brazilian real declined about 
in the case of net sales of graphite electrodes  the impact of these events was a reduction of about million in  a reduction of about million in and a reduction of about million in we sought to mitigate these adverse impacts on net sales by increasing local currency prices for some of our products in various regions as circumstances permitted 
we cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates in the future or whether those changes will have positive or negative impacts on our net sales or cost of sales 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to mitigate any adverse effects of such changes 
we have intercompany loans between graftech finance and some of our subsidiaries 
some of these loans are denominated in currencies other than the dollar and  accordingly  are subject to translation gains and losses due to changes in currency exchange rates 
some of these intercompany loans are deemed to be essentially permanent and  as a result  translation gains and losses on these loans are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets 
the remaining intercompany loans are expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and  as a result  translation gains and losses on these loans are reflected in other income expense  net on the consolidated statement of operations 
foreign currency translation gains and losses relating to these loans included in other income expense  net  were a gain of million in  a loss of million in and a gain of million in to manage certain exposures to specific financial market risks caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we use various financial instruments 
the amount of currency exchange contracts used by us to minimize these risks was million at december  and million at december  liquidity and capital resources our sources of funds have consisted principally of invested capital  cash flow from operations  debt financing and  since july  net proceeds from our public offering of common stock 
our uses of those funds other than for operations have consisted principally of debt reduction  capital expenditures  payment of fines  liabilities and expenses in connection with investigations  lawsuits and claims and payment of restructuring costs 
we are highly leveraged and have substantial obligations in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims 
we had total debt of million and a stockholders deficit of million at december  as compared to total debt of million and a stockholders deficit of million at december  we expect that our debt will increase by about to million at the end of as compared to the end of  before taking into account possible asset sales 
at december   a substantial portion of our debt had variable interest rates 
in addition  if we are required to pay or issue a letter of credit to secure payment of the fine assessed by the antitrust authority of the european union pending resolution of our appeal regarding the amount of the fine  the payment would be financed by borrowing under or secured by a letter of credit that would constitute a borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  as compared to million at december  we do not believe that we will have positive annual cash flow from operations in we believe that  following a recovery in the steel  aluminum and transportation industries  our cash flow from operations will return to positive levels 
our leverage and obligations  as well as changes in conditions affecting our industry  changes in global and regional economic conditions and other factors  have adversely impacted our recent financial performance 
in light of those factors  we closely monitor compliance with our debt covenants 
long term contractual  commercial and other obligations and commitments 
the following tables summarizes our long term contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december  payment due by period less than after total year years years years dollars in millions contractual and other obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases payment due by period less than after total year years years years dollars in millions unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations estimated liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims postretirement  pension and related benefits other long term obligations total contractual and other obligations  amount of commitment expiration by period less than after total year years years years dollars in millions other commercial commitments lines of credit letter of credit guarantees total other commercial commitments the first preceding table includes our reserve for estimated liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims  which includes the fine of euro million assessed against us by the eu competition authority 
the timing of such payments is not known and for purposes of this table is split between the columns captioned payments due in years and payments due in years on the line entitled estimated liabilities and expenses in connection with antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims 
it is the policy of eu competition authority to negotiate appropriate terms of payment of antitrust fines  including extended payment terms 
we have had discussions regarding such payment terms 
we have also filed an appeal to the court challenging the amount of the fine 
we cannot predict how or when the court would rule on the appeal 
while we cannot assure that such will be the case  we believe that amount of the fine will be impacted by the appeal and that  after such ruling  we will be permitted to pay the fine over an extended period 
in addition  if we are required to pay or issue a letter of credit to secure payment of the fine pending resolution of our appeal  the payment would be financed by a borrowing under or the letter of credit would constitute a borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
such a requirement would result in a change in the manner in which such amount is reflected in the preceding tables 
effective april  we entered into a ten year information technology service contract with cgi group inc  which became the delivery arm for our global information technology services 
the first preceding table includes a line entitled unconditional purchase obligations that includes the remaining million relating to that contract 
in september  we entered into a ten year outsourcing contract with cgi to provide finance and accounting business process services valued at million 
that contract does not constitute as an unconditional purchase obligation and therefore is not included in the first preceding table 
the second preceding table includes a line entitled lines of credit 
these are local lines of credit established by our foreign subsidiaries for working capital purposes and are not part of our revolving credit facility 
our pension benefit obligations were underfunded by million at december  as compared to million at december  this increase in underfunding was primarily due to the decline in asset values resulting from the decline in the capital markets in the us in cash flow and plans to manage liquidity 
changes in conditions affecting our industry  changes in global and regional economic conditions and other factors have adversely impacted our recent financial performance 
as a result of these changes  our high leverage  our substantial obligations in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims and our substantial other long term contractual and commercial obligations and commitments  we have placed high priority on efforts to manage cash  generate additional cash flow and reduce debt 
our longer term efforts include our major cost savings plan  our major cost savings plan and our other cost savings activities  our strategic alliances and our financing activities 
our shorter term efforts include our interest rate management and working capital initiatives 
during the four years prior to  we have had positive annual cash flow from operations  excluding payments in connection with restructurings and investigations  lawsuits and claims 
typically  the first quarter of each year results in neutral or negative cash flow from operations excluding cash used for capital expenditures and payments in connection with restructurings and investigations  lawsuits and claims due to various factors 
factors impacting seasonality include customer order patterns  customer buy ins in advance of annual price increases  fluctuations in working capital requirements and payment of variable compensation with respect to the immediately preceding year 
typically  the other three quarters result in positive cash flow from operations before such exclusions 
the third quarter tends to produce relatively less positive cash flow primarily as a result of scheduled plant shutdowns by our customers for vacations 
prior to  our cash flow from operations before such exclusions in the first and third quarters was adversely impacted by the semi annual interest payments on our previously outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the second and fourth quarters correspondingly benefited from the absence of interest payments on such notes 
we expect the semi annual interest payments on the senior notes to have a similar impact 
as part of our cash management  we typically discount or factor a portion of our accounts receivable 
certain of our subsidiaries sold receivables totaling million in  million in and million in if we had not sold such receivables  our accounts receivable and our debt would have been about million higher at december  in addition  careful management of credit risk over the past two years has allowed us to avoid significant accounts receivable losses notwithstanding the poor financial condition of many of our potential and existing customers 
in light of current global and regional economic conditions  we cannot assure that we will not be materially adversely affected by accounts receivable losses in the future 
we use  and are dependent on  funds available under our revolving credit facility  as well as cash flow from operations as our primary sources of liquidity 
as a result  we are also dependent upon continued compliance with the financial covenants under the senior facilities 
we believe that our cost savings initiatives will  over the next one to two years  continue to improve our cash flow from operations for a given level of net sales 
improvements in cash flow from operations resulting from these initiatives are being partially offset by associated cash implementation costs  while they are being implemented 
we also believe that our planned asset sales together with these improvements in cash flow from operations should allow us to reduce our debt 
we may from time to time and at any time  at prevailing market prices  exchange or purchase senior notes in open market or privately negotiated transactions for cash from cash on hand  borrowings under our revolving credit facility or new credit facilities  or proceeds from sale of debt or equity securities or assets  common stock or other equity or debt securities  or a combination thereof 
we may at any time and from time to time seek and obtain consent from the lenders under the senior facilities with respect to any restrictions thereunder applicable to such transactions 
we will evaluate any such transaction in light of then prevailing market conditions and our then current and prospective liquidity and capital resources  including projected and potential needs and prospects for access to capital markets 
any such transactions may  individually or in the aggregate  be material 
our high leverage and substantial antitrust related and other obligations could have a material impact on our liquidity 
our cash flow services payment of our debt and these obligations  thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes 
our leverage and these obligations make us more vulnerable to economic downturns or in the event that these obligations are greater or timing of payment is sooner than expected 
our ability to service our debt as it comes due is dependent on our future financial and operating performance 
our ability to maintain compliance with the covenants under the senior facilities is also dependent on our future financial and operating performance 
this performance  in turn  is subject to various factors  including certain factors beyond our control  such as changes in conditions affecting our industry  changes in global and regional economic conditions  changes in interest and currency exchange rates  developments in antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims involving us and inflation in raw material  energy and other costs 
we cannot assure that our cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to enable us to meet our debt service  antitrust related and other obligations when due 
even if we are able to meet our debt service  antitrust related and other obligations when due  we may not be able to comply with the covenants and other provisions under the senior facilities 
these covenants and provisions include financial covenants and representations regarding absence of material adverse changes affecting us 
a failure to comply  unless waived by the lenders  would be a default under the senior facilities 
this would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the senior facilities 
it would also permit the lenders to terminate their commitments to extend credit under our revolving credit facility 
this would have an immediate material adverse effect on our liquidity 
an acceleration of maturity of the senior facilities or a breach of the covenants contained in the senior notes would permit the holders of the senior notes to accelerate the maturity of the senior notes 
acceleration of maturity of the senior notes would permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the senior facilities and terminate their commitments to extend credit under our revolving credit facility 
if we were unable to repay our debt to the lenders or holders  the lenders and holders could proceed against the collateral securing the senior facilities and the senior notes  respectively  and exercise all other rights available to them 
if we were unable to repay our debt to the lenders or the holders  or otherwise obtain a waiver from the lenders or the holders  we could be required to limit or discontinue  temporarily or permanently  certain of our business plans  activities or operations  reduce or delay certain capital expenditures  sell certain of our assets or businesses  restructure or refinance some or all of our debt or incur additional debt  or sell additional common stock or other securities 
we cannot assure that we would be able to obtain any such waiver or take any of such actions on favorable terms or at all 
as described above  we are dependent on our revolving credit facility and continuing compliance with the financial covenants under the senior facilities for liquidity 
the senior facilities require us to  among other things  comply with financial covenants relating to specified minimum interest coverage and maximum net senior secured debt leverage ratios that become more restrictive over time 
at december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants under the senior facilities 
if we were to believe that we would not continue to comply with such covenants  we would seek an appropriate waiver or amendment from the lenders thereunder 
we cannot assure that would be able to obtain such waiver or amendment on acceptable terms or at all 
while our revolving credit facility provides for maximum borrowings of up to euro million million  based on currency exchange rates in effect at december   our ability to borrow under this facility may effectively be less because of the impact of additional borrowings upon our compliance with the maximum net senior secured debt leverage ratio permitted or minimum interest coverage ratio required under the senior facilities 
in addition  euro million of the euro million is reserved exclusively for use to pay or secure payment of the fine assessed by the antitrust authority of the european union 
at december   we had full availability under our revolving credit facility and the outstanding balance thereunder was million 
in addition  payment of the fine or issuance of a letter of credit to secure payment of the fine assessed by the antitrust authority of the european union would significantly reduce remaining funds available under our revolving credit facility for operating and other purposes 
we believe that the long term fundamentals of our business continue to be sound 
accordingly  although we cannot assure that such will be the case  we believe that  based on our expected cash flow from operations  our expected resolution of our remaining obligations in connection with antitrust investigations  lawsuits and claims  and our existing capital resources  and taking into account our efforts to reduce costs and working capital needs  improve efficiencies and product quality  generate growth and cash flow and maximize funds available to meet our debt service and other obligations  we will be able to manage our liquidity to permit us to service our debt and meet our obligations when due 
description of senior facilities 
the senior facilities consist of o a tranche a facility which provided for initial term loans of million and euro million equivalent to million based on currency exchange rates in effect at february  to graftech finance 
at december   the tranche a facility had been fully repaid and terminated 
o a tranche b facility providing for initial term loans of million to graftech finance 
at december   the principal amount of term loans outstanding under the tranche b facility was million  all of the scheduled principal payments of which are due in o a revolving facility providing for dollar and euro denominated revolving and swing line loans to  and the issuance of dollar denominated letters of credit for the account of  graftech finance and certain of our other subsidiaries in an aggregate principal and stated amount at any time not to exceed  initially  euro million and  at december   euro million euro million of which can only be used to pay or secure payment of the fine assessed by the eu competition commission 
the revolving facility terminates on february  as a condition to each borrowing under the revolving facility  we are required to represent  among other things  that the aggregate amount of payments made excluding certain imputed interest and additional reserves created in connection with antitrust  securities and stockholder derivative investigations  lawsuits and claims do not exceed million by more than million which million is reduced by the amount of certain debt excluding the senior notes incurred by us that is not incurred under the senior facilities million of which debt was outstanding at december we are generally required to make mandatory prepayments in the amount of o either or depending on our net debt leverage ratio  which is the ratio of our net debt to our ebitda of excess cash flow 
the obligation to make these prepayments  if any  arises after the end of each year with respect to adjusted excess cash flow during the prior year  o of the net proceeds of certain asset sales or incurrence of certain indebtedness  and o of the net proceeds of the issuance of certain gti equity securities 
we may make voluntary prepayments under the senior facilities 
there is no penalty or premium due in connection with prepayments whether voluntary or mandatory 
graftech finance has made and may make secured and guaranteed intercompany loans of the net proceeds of borrowings under the senior facilities to graftech global s subsidiaries 
the obligations of graftech finance under the senior facilities are secured  with certain exceptions  by first priority security interests in all of these intercompany loans including the related security interests and guarantees 
we used the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes in february to finance the repayment of all of these intercompany loans that were outstanding at that time  except for intercompany revolving loans to ucar carbon and our swiss subsidiary 
gti unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the obligations of graftech finance under the senior facilities 
this guarantee is secured  with certain exceptions  by first priority security interests in all of the outstanding capital stock of graftech global and graftech finance  all of the intercompany debt owed to gti and gti s interest in the lawsuit initiated by us against our former parents 
gti  graftech global and each of graftech global s subsidiaries guarantees  with certain exceptions  the obligations of graftech global s subsidiaries under the intercompany loans  except that our foreign subsidiaries do not guarantee the intercompany loan obligations of our us subsidiaries 
the obligations of graftech global s subsidiaries under the intercompany loans as well as these guarantees are secured  with certain exceptions  by first priority security interests in substantially all of our assets  except that no more than of the capital stock or other equity interests in our foreign subsidiaries held directly by our us subsidiaries  and no other foreign assets  secure obligations or guarantees of our us subsidiaries 
at december   the interest rate applicable to the revolving facility is  at our option  either euro libor plus a margin ranging from to depending on our leverage ratio or the alternate base rate plus a margin ranging from to depending on our leverage ratio 
at december   the interest rate applicable to the tranche b facility is  at our option  either euro libor plus a margin ranging from to depending on our leverage ratio or the alternate base rate plus a margin ranging from to depending on our leverage ratio 
the alternate base rate is the higher of the prime rate announced by jp morgan chase bank or the federal funds effective rate  plus 
graftech finance pays a per annum fee ranging from to depending on our leverage ratio on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the revolving facility 
at december   the interest rates on outstanding debt under the senior facilities were tranche b facility   dollar denominated borrowings under the revolving facility   and euro denominated borrowings under the revolving facility  
the weighted average interest rate on the senior facilities was during the senior facilities contain a number of significant covenants that  among other things  significantly restrict our ability to sell assets  incur additional debt  repay or refinance other debt or amend other debt instruments  create liens on assets  enter into sale and lease back transactions  make investments or acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  make capital expenditures  make intercompany dividend payments to gti  pay intercompany debt owed to gti  engage in transactions with affiliates  pay dividends to stockholders of gti or make other restricted payments and that otherwise significantly restrict corporate activities 
in addition  we are required to comply with financial covenants relating to specified minimum interest coverage ratios and maximum net senior secured debt leverage ratios which is the ratio of our net senior secured debt to our ebitda  which become more restrictive over time  beginning september  under the senior facilities  gti is permitted to pay dividends on  and repurchase  common stock in an aggregate annual amount of million  plus up to an additional million if certain leverage ratio and excess cash flow requirements are satisfied 
we are also permitted to repurchase common stock from present or former directors  officers or employees in an aggregate amount of up to the lesser of million per year with unused amounts permitted to be carried forward or million on a cumulative basis since february  in addition to the failure to pay principal  interest and fees when due  events of default under the senior facilities include failure to comply with applicable covenants  failure to pay when due  or other defaults permitting acceleration of  other indebtedness exceeding million  judgment defaults in excess of million to the extent not covered by insurance  certain events of bankruptcy  and certain changes in control 
certain amendments to the senior facilities 
in april  the senior facilities were amended to  among other things  exclude certain expenses incurred in connection with the lawsuit initiated by us against our former parents up to a maximum of million  but not more than million in any quarter and certain charges and payments in connection with antitrust fines  settlements and expenses from the calculation of financial covenants 
after giving effect to subsequent amendments to the senior facilities  payments within the million charge recorded in are excluded from the calculation of financial covenants and charges over and above the million charge are excluded from the calculation of financial covenants until paid up to a maximum of million reduced by the amount of certain debt other than the senior notes incurred by us that is not incurred under the senior facilities million of which debt was outstanding at december  
as a result  the fine assessed by the eu competition authority  as well as the additional million charge recorded in july and any payments related to such fine including payments within the million charge  are excluded from such calculations 
in july  in connection with an underwritten public offering of common stock  the senior facilities were amended to  among other things  change our financial covenants so that they were less restrictive than would otherwise have been the case 
in connection therewith  we agreed that our investments in unrestricted subsidiaries after this amendment will be made in the form of secured loans  which will be pledged to secure the senior facilities 
in connection therewith  we paid an amendment fee of million and the margin that is added to either euro libor or the alternate base rate in order to determine the interest rate payable thereunder increased by basis points 
in december  the senior facilities were amended to  among other things  permit a corporate realignment of our subsidiaries 
in connection therewith  we paid an amendment fee of million 
in february  the senior facilities were amended to  among other things  permit us to issue up to million aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
the amendment also changed the manner in which net debt and ebitda are calculated to exclude any letter of credit issued to secure payment of the antitrust fine assessed against us by the eu competition authority 
in addition  the amendment expanded our ability to make certain investments  including investments in aet  and eliminated provisions relating to a spin off of aet 
in connection therewith  we paid an amendment fee of million and the margin that is added to either euro libor or the alternate base rate in order to determine the interest rate payable thereunder increased by basis points 
in may  the senior facilities were amended to  among other things  permit us to issue up to million aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
in connection with this amendment  our maximum permitted leverage ratio was changed to measure the ratio of net senior secured debt to ebitda as against new specified amounts 
our interest coverage ratio was also changed 
we believe that these changed ratios provide us with greater flexibility 
in addition  the amendment reduced the maximum amount available under the revolving facility to euro million from euro million euro million of which can only be used to pay or secure payment of the fine assessed by the eu competition authority and reduced the basket for certain debt incurred by us that is not incurred under the senior facilities excluding the senior notes to million from million million of which debt was outstanding at december  
in connection with the amendment and the consent  we paid fees and costs of million 
senior notes 
on february   graftech finance issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on february and august of each year  commencing august   at the rate of per annum 
the senior notes mature on february  in april  we obtained consent from the holders of the senior notes issued in february to amend the indenture so as to waive the requirement to use the gross proceeds from the issuance of up to million aggregate principal amount of additional senior notes to make intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries 
on april   we entered into a supplemental indenture 
on may   graftech finance issued million aggregate principal amount of additional senior notes at a purchase price of of principal amount  plus accrued interest from february   under the same indenture pursuant to which it issued the senior notes in february the senior notes constitute one class of debt securities under the indenture 
the additional senior notes bear interest at the same rate and mature on the same date as the senior notes issued in february the million premium received upon issuance of the additional senior notes was added to the principal amount of the senior notes shown on the consolidated balance sheets and is amortized as a credit to interest expense over the term of the additional senior notes 
as a result of our receipt of such premium  the effective annual interest rate on the additional senior notes is about 
on june   graftech finance offered to exchange new registered senior notes and related guarantees that are substantially identical to the previously outstanding senior notes and related guarantees  except that certain transfer restrictions and registration rights relating to the previously outstanding senior notes would not apply to the new registered senior notes and related guarantees 
all of the previously outstanding senior notes and related guarantees were exchanged under the exchange offer 
except as described below  graftech finance may not redeem the senior notes prior to february  on or after that date  graftech finance may redeem the senior notes  in whole or in part  at specified redemption prices beginning at of the principal amount redeemed for the year commencing february  and reducing to of the principal amount redeemed for the years commencing february   and thereafter  in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
in addition  before february   graftech finance is entitled at its option on one or more occasions to redeem senior notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed of the aggregate principal amount of senior notes originally issued by graftech finance at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date  with the net cash proceeds from one or more underwritten primary public offerings of common stock of gti pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act so long as o at least of such aggregate principal amount of senior notes remains outstanding immediately after each such redemption other than senior notes held  directly or indirectly  by us  and o each such redemption occurs within days after the date of the related public offering 
upon the occurrence of a change of control  graftech finance will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to of the principal amount redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
for this purpose  a change in control occurs on o the date on which any person beneficially owns more than of the total voting power of gti  or o the date on which individuals  who on the issuance date of the senior notes were directors of gti or individuals nominated or elected by a vote of of such directors or directors previously so elected or nominated  cease to constitute a majority of gti s board of directors then in office  or o the date on which a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of gti is adopted  or o the date on which gti merges or consolidates with or into another person  or another person merges into gti  or all or substantially all of gti s assets are sold determined on a consolidated basis  with certain specified exceptions  or o the date on which gti ceases to own  directly or indirectly  all of the voting power of graftech global  ucar carbon and graftech finance 
the senior notes rank senior to present and future subordinated debt and equally with present and future senior debt and obligations of graftech finance 
the senior notes are effectively subordinated to present and future secured debt and obligations of graftech finance  to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and obligations  and are structurally subordinated to debt and obligations  including trade payables  of subsidiaries that are neither guarantors of the senior notes nor unsecured intercompany term note obligors 
gti  graftech global and ucar carbon and other us subsidiaries holding a substantial majority of our us assets have guaranteed the senior notes on a senior unsecured basis  except that the guarantee by ucar carbon is secured as described below 
unsecured intercompany term notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to million based on currency exchange rates in effect at december  and guarantees of those unsecured intercompany term notes issued to graftech finance by certain of our foreign subsidiaries have been pledged by graftech finance to secure the senior notes  subject to the limitation that at no time will the combined value of the pledged portion of any foreign subsidiary s unsecured intercompany term note and unsecured guarantee of unsecured intercompany term notes issued by other foreign subsidiaries exceed of the principal amount of the then outstanding senior notes 
as a result of this limitation  the principal amount of unsecured intercompany term notes pledged to secure the senior notes equals million  or about of the principal amount of the outstanding senior notes 
the remaining unsecured intercompany term notes held by graftech finance in an aggregate principal amount of million based on currency exchange rates in effect at december   and any pledged unsecured intercompany term notes that cease to be pledged due to a reduction in the principal amount of the then outstanding senior notes due to redemption  repurchase or other events  will not be subject to any pledge and will be available to satisfy the claims of creditors including the lenders under the senior facilities and the holders of the senior notes of graftech finance  as their interests may appear 
the senior notes contain provisions restricting  subject to certain exceptions  the pledge of those unsecured intercompany term notes to secure any debt or obligation unless they are equally and ratably pledged to secure the senior notes for so long as such other pledge continues in effect 
the guarantee by ucar carbon has been secured by a pledge of all of our shares of aet  but at no time will the value of the pledged portion of such shares exceed of the principal amount of the then outstanding senior notes 
the pledge of the shares of aet is junior to the pledge of the same shares to secure ucar carbon s guarantee of the senior facilities 
the unsecured intercompany term note obligations rank senior to present and future subordinated guarantees  debt and obligations of the respective obligors  and equally with present and future senior guarantees  debt and obligations of the respective obligors 
the unsecured intercompany term note obligations are effectively subordinated to present and future secured guarantees  debt and obligations of the respective obligors  to the extent of the value of the assets securing such guarantees  debt and obligations  and are structurally subordinated to guarantees  debt and obligations  including trade payables  of subsidiaries of the respective obligors that are not also unsecured intercompany term note obligors 
the senior notes contain a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments  create or permit to exist restrictions on distributions from subsidiaries  sell assets  engage in certain transactions with affiliates or enter into certain mergers and consolidations 
in addition to the failure to pay principal and interest when due or to repurchase senior notes when required  events of default under the senior notes include failure to comply with applicable covenants  failure to pay at maturity or upon acceleration indebtedness exceeding million  judgment defaults in excess of million to the extent not covered by insurance  and certain events of bankruptcy 
the senior notes contain provisions as to legal defeasance and covenant defeasance 
related party transactions 
we have not  since january   engaged in any material transactions with affiliates or related parties other than transactions with our subsidiaries including carbone savoie and aet  compensatory transactions including employee benefits  stock option and restricted stock grants  compensation deferral and executive employee loans and stock purchases with directors or officers  and transactions with our owned joint venture with jilin in china 
we have not been  since january   affiliated with or related to any special purpose entity other than graftech finance 
off balance sheet financings and commitments 
we do not have any material off balance sheet financing arrangements or other commitments including non exchange traded contracts  other than o interest rate caps and currency exchange rate contracts which are described under item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
o commitments under non cancelable operating leases that  at december   total less than million in each year and million in the aggregate 
o commitments under our information technology outsourcing services agreement with cgi group inc that  at december   total approximately million in each year and about million in the aggregate 
as part of our cash management activities  we seek to manage accounts receivable credit risk  collections  and accounts payable and payments thereof to maximize our free cash at any given time 
careful management of credit risk has allowed us to avoid significant accounts receivable losses in light of the poor financial condition of many of our potential and existing customers 
in light of current and prospective global and regional economic conditions  we cannot assure you that we will not be materially adversely affected by accounts receivable losses in the future 
we typically discount or factor a substantial portion of our accounts receivable 
certain of our subsidiaries sold accounts receivable aggregating million in  million in and million in we estimate that million of such accounts receivable would have been outstanding at december  accounts receivable sold and remaining on the consolidated balance sheet aggregated million at december  cash flow used in provided by operating activities 
cash flow used in operations was million in as compared to cash flow provided by operations of million in  a decline of million 
this decline was primarily due to a decrease in net income before non cash charges credits of million from a positive million in to a negative million in  primarily due to lower net sales 
in addition  use of working capital increased million 
working capital was a use of million of cash flow in  an increase of million from a use of million of cash flow in the change in working capital occurred primarily due to a million decrease in accounts payable and accruals  a million increase in notes and accounts receivable and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  largely offset by a million decrease in inventories and a million reduction in payments related to antitrust investigations and related lawsuits and claims and payments related to restructurings 
accounts payable and accruals declined primarily due to the mothballing of our italian and us graphite electrode operations and the high level of accounts payable at december  accounts receivable increased primarily due to higher net sales in the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter 
inventory levels decreased due to the mothballing of our graphite electrode operations in italy and us cash flow provided by operations was million in as compared to cash flow provided by operations of million in this decline of million resulted primarily from an increase of million in the use of cash flow for working capital 
net income before non cash items charges credits and extraordinary items net of tax was stable at million in each of and working capital was a use of million of cash flow in  a change of million from a source of million of cash flow in the change occurred primarily due to a million increase in inventories  a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in restructuring payments  and a million increase in prepaid expenses  partially offset by a million reduction in payments for antitrust fines and net settlements and expenses 
graphite electrode inventory levels increased primarily due to transitioning activities in connection with the shutdown of our us graphite electrode manufacturing operations and lower than expected volume of graphite electrodes sold 
accounts payable increased primarily due to our cash management activities  partially offset by lower spending  including lower purchases of petroleum coke as excess inventories stockpiled following the explosion at one of conocophillips petroleum coke plants were reduced and lower production levels as demand for graphite electrodes and certain other products weakened during cash flow used in investing activities 
we used million of cash flow in investing activities during as compared to million during  in each case primarily for capital expenditures 
the increase of million was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in related primarily to expansion of manufacturing graphite electrode capacity in mexico  expansion of cathode manufacturing capacity in france  jd edwards system implementation and essential maintenance 
we used million of cash flow in investing activities during as compared to million during  in each case primarily for capital expenditures 
the reduction of million was primarily due to a reduction in capital expenditures that did not constitute strategic capital investments or essential maintenance 
cash flow provided by used in financing activities 
cash flow provided by financing activities was million during as compared to cash flow provided by financing activities of million in the increase of million was primarily attributable to million of proceeds from our sale of million of senior notes in  of which million was used to repay other long term debt  million was used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and million was used to pay financing costs 
in addition  we received million from the reset of interest rate swaps 
cash flow provided by financing activities was million during as compared to cash flow used in financing activities of million in during  we received net proceeds of million from our public offering of common stock in july  and million from an additional minority investment in connection with the broadening of our strategic alliance in the cathode business with pechiney  and made million in net debt repayments 
during  we incurred million of costs  fees and expenses in connection with our debt recapitalization in february and had an increase in net borrowing of million 
restrictions on dividends and stock repurchases under the senior facilities  we are generally permitted to pay dividends on common stock and repurchase common stock in an aggregate annual amount of between million and million  depending on our leverage ratio and excess cash flow 
under the senior notes  we are generally permitted to pay dividends on common stock and repurchase common stock in an aggregate cumulative from february  amount of million  plus certain consolidated net income  equity proceeds and investment gains 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies as those that require difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
however  the following accounting policies could be deemed to be critical 
reliance on estimates 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  we use and rely on estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for doubtful accounts  provisions for restructuring charges and contingencies  tax valuation allowances  evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and post retirement benefit obligations and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
estimates require us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our estimates for these matters are reasonable  if the actual amount is significantly different than the estimated amount  our assets  liabilities or results of operations may be overstated or understated 
employee benefit plans 
we sponsor various retirement and pension plans  including defined benefit  defined contribution plans and post retirement benefit plans that cover most employees worldwide 
these plans require assumptions for the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  expected salary increases and health care cost trend rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on these rates and the effect of a change in these rates on our results of operations 
financial instruments 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
the adoption did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
they are used to manage well defined currency exchange rate risks and interest rate risks 
we enter into foreign currency instruments to manage exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
these foreign currency instruments  which include  but not limited to  forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options  attempt to hedge global currency exposures  net  relating to euro denominated debt  identifiable foreign currency receivables  payables and commitments held by our foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
forward exchange contracts are agreements to exchange different currencies at a specified future date and at a specified rate 
purchased foreign currency options are instruments which give the holder the right  but not the obligation  to exchange different currencies at a specified rate at a specified date or over a range of specified dates 
forward exchange contracts and purchased currency options are carried at market value 
gains and losses due to the recording of such contracts at fair value are recognized currently as other income expense  net 
at december  and  the aggregate net notional amount of these contracts approximated million and million  respectively 
all of these contracts mature within one year and are marked to market monthly 
unrealized gains and losses on outstanding foreign currency contracts was a loss of million at december  and nil at december  we implement interest rate management initiatives to seek to minimize our interest expense and optimize our portfolio of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
use of these initiatives is allowed under the senior notes and the senior facilities 
in the second quarter  we entered into two ten year interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of million to effectively convert that amount of fixed rate debt represented by senior notes to variable rate debt 
these interest rate swaps are fair value swaps and are accounted for based on the short cut method 
these swaps reduced our interest expense in by million 
in the third quarter  we reset our interest rate swaps to allow for the accelerated collection of million in cash 
the collection of this cash will be amortized over the term of the senior notes and recorded as a credit against interest expense 
the adjustment for the fair value of the hedged debt obligations was million at december  and has been recorded as part of other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
in the first quarter  we entered into an additional ten year interest rate swap for a notional amount of million that effectively converted that amount of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
in the first quarter  we also entered into five year interest rate caps for a notional amount of million 
subsequently in the first quarter  we sold the entire million notional amount of our interest rate swaps for million in cash 
the adjustment of the carrying amount of the senior notes will be amortized over the term of the senior notes and recorded as a credit against interest expense 
following the sale of the swaps  in march  we entered into million notional amount of interest rate swaps through the remaining term of our senior notes 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as those relating to environmental  legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different from the estimated loss  our results of operations may be overstated or understated 
impairments of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
if the actual value is significantly less than the estimated fair value  our assets may be overstated 
inventories 
we record the value of inventories at the lower of cost or market  and periodically review the book value of products and product lines to determine if they are properly valued 
we also periodically review the composition of our inventories and seek to identify slow moving inventories 
in connection with those reviews  we seek to identify products that may not be properly valued and assess the ability to dispose of them at a price greater than cost 
if it is determined that cost is less than market value  then cost is used for inventory valuation 
if a write down to current market value is necessary  the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value  sometimes called the ceiling defined as selling price less costs to complete and dispose  and cannot be lower than the net realizable value less a normal profit margin  sometimes called the floor 
generally  we do not experience issues with obsolete inventory due to the nature of our products 
if the actual value is significantly less than the recorded value  our assets may be overstated 
accounting for income taxes 
when we prepare the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this process requires us to make the following assessments o we estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction 
o we estimate our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as lease revenue and related depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we include within our consolidated balance sheet 
o we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  if we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
if our estimates are incorrect  our assets or liabilities may be overstated or understated 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we do not believe that adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position because the impact will be limited to additional disclosure 
in november  fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   and require that we record a liability  if any  for the fair value of such guarantees in the consolidated balance sheet 
as required  at december   we have enhanced our disclosures for certain guarantees  indemnification arrangements and product warranties 
we provide insurance coverage and are required to indemnify directors and officers for actions taken on our behalf 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost as defined in issue no 
is recognized at the date an entity commits to an exit plan 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in april  fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the provisions of sfas no

rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and an amendment thereto  and sfas no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
currently  generally accepted accounting principles require that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
based on sfas no 
 gains and losses from extinguishment of debt are classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria of accounting principle boards opinion apb  reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the provisions of apb distinguish transactions that are part of an entity s recurring operations from those that are unusual or infrequent or that meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item 
as such  those that do not meet the criteria of apb are included in the statement of operations before income loss before provisions benefits for income taxes  minority interest and extraordinary items 
all prior periods presented that do not meet the criteria in apb for classification as an extraordinary item shall be reclassified 
sfas no 
also rescinds sfas no 
 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers

amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
sfas no 
also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
we do not expect the provisions of sfas no 
relating to sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the provisions of sfas no 
relating to sfas no 
and the other provisions of sfas no 
 excluding the provisions relating to sfas no 
 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in august  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  excluding goodwill and other intangible assets not being amortized pursuant to sfas no 
 and certain other assets 
sfas no

sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
sfas no

on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain other intangibles no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
was effective january  the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations  except that we no longer amortize goodwill 
goodwill amortization was million in we have performed the goodwill impairment reviews required by sfas and the results of these reviews did not require our existing goodwill to be written down 
costs relating to protection of the environment we have been and are subject to increasingly stringent environmental protection laws and regulations 
in addition  we have an on going commitment to rigorous internal environmental protection standards 
environmental considerations are part of all significant capital expenditure decisions 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding environmental expenses and capital expenditures 
for the year ended december  dollars in millions expenses relating to environmental protection capital expenditures related to environmental protection item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
we routinely enter into various transactions that have been authorized according to documented policies and procedures to manage well defined risks 
we do not use derivatives to generate income 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from floating rate long term debt tied to libor or euro libor 
we implement interest rate management initiatives to seek to minimize our interest expense and optimize our portfolio of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
use of these initiatives is allowed under the senior notes and the senior facilities 
in the second quarter  we entered into two ten year interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of million to effectively convert that amount of fixed rate debt represented by senior notes to variable rate debt 
these interest rate swaps are fair value swaps and are accounted for based on the short cut method 
these swaps reduced our interest expense in the by million 
in the third quarter  we reset our interest rate swaps to allow the accelerated collection of million in cash 
the collection of this cash will be amortized over the term of the senior notes and recorded as a credit against interest expense 
the adjustment for the fair value of the hedged debt obligations was million at december  and has been recorded as part of other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the weighted average pay rate on the swaps is plus the six month libor in arrears and the weighted average receive rate is 
our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates results primarily from o investments in our foreign subsidiaries and in our share of the earnings of those subsidiaries  which are denominated in local currencies  o raw material purchases made by our foreign subsidiaries in a currency other than the local currency  and o export sales made by our subsidiaries in a currency other than the local currency 
when we deem it appropriate  we may attempt to limit our risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates through both operational activities and financial instruments 
financial instruments may be used to attempt to hedge existing exposures  firm commitments and  potentially  anticipated transactions 
we use these instruments to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures
