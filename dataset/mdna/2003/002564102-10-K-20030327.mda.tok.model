 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between this statement and issue relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion reached by the board in this statement is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability 
therefore  this statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in issue this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability

critical accounting policies the company follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing its consolidated financial statements 
a summary of these policies is included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain policies require the company to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions which are sensitive to deviations from actual results 
in particular  the company makes estimates regarding future undiscounted cash flows from the use of long lived assets in assessing potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
since there were no events or changes in circumstances to indicate the carrying value of long lived assets were impaired  the company recorded no adjustment to the carrying value of these assets 
the company does not expect events or circumstances to significantly change  thereby affecting the carrying value of long lived assets 
in addition  the company has estimated the net realizable value of accounts receivable by evaluating the current pool of accounts receivable in light of past experience and current knowledge of its customer base 
the company believes the reserves recorded in the financial statements are adequate for potential credit losses 
it is possible the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of this pool of accounts receivable changes over time or if the health of the economy or the construction industry deteriorates 
finally  the company evaluates whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market based on historical experience with the carrying value and life of inventory 
the assumptions used in this evaluation are based on current market conditions and the company believes inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market in the financial statements
