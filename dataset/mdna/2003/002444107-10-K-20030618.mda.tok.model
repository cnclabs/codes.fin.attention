item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general during the fourth quarter of fiscal  customers began to experience a slow down in the rate of growth in demand for their products and determined that they had accumulated excess passive component inventory 
the utilization of the accumulated inventory and the decline in the worldwide economy  in particular  the impact on the telecommunication and data processing markets  led to a significant decline in the demand for our products throughout fiscal throughout fiscal  we have experienced modest increases in unit demand in line with the end market demand for our customers products  but average selling prices for our products have declined 
during fiscal and  the imbalance of the industry s production capacity and market demand has led to a decline in average selling prices for commodity related products 
reduced selling prices  low production levels when compared to available production capacity  and higher raw material costs have led to lower operating margins 
in reaction to the slow down in demand  we have significantly reduced our labor force and operating costs 
during fiscal and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of restructuring and special charges as part of our cost reduction initiatives 
we continue to evaluate our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities in conjunction with expected demand 
we continue to invest in new products and improvements to the production processes and are committed to investing in research  development and engineering in order to provide our customers with new generations of passive component and connector product solutions 
we believe this philosophy will enable us to capitalize on improved market conditions and provide shareholder value 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationships to net sales of certain income statement items for the periods presented 
years ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income loss before income taxes net income loss page outlook near term although the information available to us regarding our numerous customers inventory levels is limited  we believe the passive component inventory at electronic distributors  cems and oems was dramatically reduced during fiscal and and are at levels that support current end demand 
the near term results for us will depend on the growth in the economy and the resulting expansion of the telecommunication  information technology hardware  automobile and other electronic markets  as well as resolution of certain geopolitical situations 
our expectation is that  as these markets resume growth  our unit volumes will increase  but the continued imbalance in demand and capacity in the near term may continue to lead to lower average selling prices for commodity related products 
higher sales volume  the resulting through put in our factories and ongoing restructuring and manufacturing realignment efforts will reduce average production costs  but lower sales prices may mitigate all or a portion of the benefit 
the majority of our commodity related ceramic capacitors are currently manufactured using nickel 
we continue to use palladium metal in the manufacture of certain ceramic capacitors 
the palladium market has experienced dramatic price volatility over the past several years 
we continue to offset the cost of palladium through conversion to the use of base metals 
we believe that our programs will continue to reduce  but not entirely eliminate  our use of palladium in the future 
in fiscal  due to the sudden and significant decrease in product demand and our ongoing conversion to nickel  palladium inventory levels exceeded our forecasted quantity requirements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  a portion of our palladium inventory was written down to net realizable value during fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of increased demand for components using palladium  forecasts indicated that we would be using the remaining balance of this excess palladium inventory in production 
accordingly  we no longer record the effects of market price reductions on palladium inventory 
the palladium inventory will be used in production at its current raw material carrying cost 
tantalum powder is a principal material used in the manufacture of solid tantalum capacitors 
the market for tantalum powder  which has historically been stable  experienced supply shortages and price volatility during fiscal during fiscal  in order to reduce the risk of interruption of supply  we entered into a long term contract for the supply of a portion of our anticipated annual material requirement see note to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein 
prices under the contract exceed current market prices for tantalum powder 
if forecasted demand does not develop or if average capacitor selling prices decline  the quantities on hand and purchase commitments could lead to write downs of materials to net realizable values and adjustments to future purchase commitments 
page for discussion of our pending litigation with cabot corporation regarding the existing tantalum supply agreement  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  depending upon unit demand and component pricing  we may need to take additional restructuring actions which could lead to related charges 
long term we continue to be optimistic for opportunities of long term growth and profitability beginning in fiscal due to a the continued increase as a long term trend in worldwide demand for electronic devices which require our electronic components  b cost reductions and improvements in our production processes and c opportunities for growth in our advanced product line due to advances in component design 
results of operations year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales for the year ended march  decreased to  million from  million for the year ended march  passive components sales during the year decreased to  million  while connector sales declined to million 
the decline in sales was primarily due to continued downward pricing pressure resulting in lower selling prices for commodity related products and the continuation of the trend toward smaller part sizes  which traditionally have lower average selling prices 
the decrease in revenue for passive components was also partially attributable to the continued soft demand across most markets  particularly the telecommunications and information technology hardware industries 
geographically  compared to the same period last year  sales in all regions declined 
the decrease in demand had a greater effect on european sales as customers continue to shift production capability to asia 
regionally  sales in europe  asia and the am ericas declined  and to million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit for the year ended march  decreased to million of net sales from million of net sales for the year ended march  reductions in operating expenses and improved unit production were offset by reduced selling prices negatively impacting gross profit in dollar terms and as a percentage of sales 
in addition  continued high costs for raw materials  particularly tantalum powder  contributed to the higher cost of sales 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by special charges totaling million  primarily relating to employee severance and benefit costs resulting from the closure of a european facility that was initiated during the previous fiscal year 
for the year ended march   gross profit was impacted by special charges of million  primarily relating to inventory write downs for precious metals  obsolete raw materials and finished goods  and million of restructuring expense as part of a comprehensive plan to reduce operating costs and reorganize operations 
we continue to focus on improvements in our manufacturing processes and shifting production to lower labor cost areas such as eastern europe and asia 
as part of our cost reduction programs  we have continued in our efforts to shift the majority of our production of commodity related multi layer ceramic capacitors from palladium to base metals  such as nickel 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  were million of net sales  compared with million of net sales for the year ended march  the expenses for the year ended march  include a million special charge for doubtful customers receivables 
the decline in selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal is due to lower sales commissions to independent manufacturers representatives  reductions in administrative staff headcount and operating expenses resulting from cost cutting measures initiated last year 
page research  development and engineering expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products  processes and technical innovations  were approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these costs are reflected in both cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses in the income statement 
the costs were incurred as we continue to enhance existing product lines  develop new products  convert to the use of base metals in the manufacture of ceramic capacitors and develop high capacitance capacitors 
as a result of the above factors  the loss from operations for the year ended march  was million compared to a loss of million for the year ended march  as discussed above  the loss from operations included special charges of million in fiscal compared to special charges and restructuring costs totaling million in fiscal other income decreased million to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease is due to lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on invested cash and securities  partially offset by lower interest expense on lower debt 
income tax expense of million includes million of tax adjustments resulting from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters and a one time state tax refund related to a technology investment tax credit offset primarily by the non recognition of tax benefits related to certain foreign net operating losses 
as a result of the factors discussed above  the net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was million compared to a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales for the year ended march  decreased to  million from  million for the year ended march  passive components sales during the year decreased to  million  while connector sales declined to million 
the decrease in revenue for both segments was attributable to the softening in demand across all markets  particularly the telecommunications and information technology hardware industries 
in addition  sales during the current period were also depressed as certain customers utilized their existing inventories in order to reduce quantities on hand 
the majority of our customers experienced a significant slow down in the demand for their products in early that resulted in excess passive component inventory in the industry wide supply chain 
the decline in sales was also a result of lower selling prices for commodity related products and the continuation of the trend toward smaller part sizes  which traditionally have lower average selling prices 
geographically  compared to the same period last year  sales in all regions had significant declines 
the decrease in demand had a greater effect on domestic sales as customers continue to shift production capability to asia 
accordingly  sales in north america decreased from of total sales for fiscal to of total sales for fiscal gross profit for the year ended march  decreased to million of net sales from million of net sales for the year ended march  despite a reduction in operating expenses  reduced sales  reduced selling prices and lower manufacturing volumes resulting in reduced cost absorption negatively impacted gross profit in dollar terms and as a percentage of sales 
in addition  higher costs for raw materials  particularly tantalum powder  contributed to the higher cost of sales 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by special charges totaling million  primarily relating to inventory write downs for precious metals  obsolete raw materials and finished goods 
the inventory charges were the result of excess quantities on hand due to the sudden and significant decrease in demand and reductions in the net realizable value of such inventory 
we continued to focus on improvements in our manufacturing processes and shifting production to low labor cost areas such as eastern europe and the far east 
as part of our cost reduction programs  we shifted the majority of our production of commodity related multi layer ceramic capacitors from palladium to base metals  such as nickel 
page during the year ended march   we recorded million of restructuring expense as part of a comprehensive plan to reduce operating costs and reorganize its operations in light of the economic downturn 
the restructuring costs included million for employee severance and benefit costs and million for passive component manufacturing and warehousing facility consolidations 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  were million of net sales  compared with million of net sales for the year ended march  the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses  in absolute terms  is primarily due to lower sales commissions to independent manufacturers representatives million  the reduction in administrative staff headcount and operating expenses million  and lower research and development costs million 
the expenses for the year ended march  include a million special charge for doubtful customers receivables 
the economic environment led to the receivables due from a few smaller customers to be significantly past due and determined to be uncollectable 
research  development and engineering expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products  processes and technical innovations  were approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these costs are reflected in both cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses on the income statement 
the costs were incurred as we continued to enhance existing product lines  develop new products  convert to the use of base metals in the manufacture of ceramic capacitors and develop high capacitance capacitors 
as a result of the above factors  the loss from operations for the year ended march  was million compared to a profit of million for the year ended march  for the reasons set forth above  higher income tax expenses due to the nondeductability of losses for certain european operations offset in part by higher interest income on invested cash  the net loss for the year ended march  was million compared to net income of million for the year ended march  financial condition liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements  dividends  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
historically  we have satisfied our liquidity requirements through internally generated funds 
as of march   we had a current ratio of to  million of cash  cash equivalents and long term securities investments   million of stockholders equity and an insignificant amount of debt 
net cash from operating activities was million for the year ended march   million for the year ended march  and million for the year ended march  purchases of property and equipment were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal these expenditures related to expanding the production capabilities of the passive component and connector product lines  moving production capacity to lower cost regions such as latin america  eastern europe and asia  as well as the implementation of lower cost manufacturing processes 
this includes the construction of a  square foot manufacturing facility in china that was started during fiscal when compared to fiscal  the decline in capital expenditures over the past two fiscal years is in response to the slow down in the rate of growth in demand for our customers products and the corresponding demand in production requirements 
the carrying value for our equipment reflects the use of the accelerated double declining balance method to compute depreciation expense for machinery and equipment 
we continue to add additional capacity for advanced and specialty passive component and connector products and expect to incur capital expenditures at or near fiscal levels during fiscal due to the decline in capital expenditures and the use of the accelerated double declining balance method to compute depreciation expense for machinery and equipment  overall depreciation expense will continue to decline year over year in fiscal page during fiscal  we purchased a interest in the research and development company  electro chemical research ltd 
ecr 
we made a further investment of million in may for an additional interest in ecr 
we currently own of ecr s outstanding shares 
ecr has developed and patented a technology for high capacity electrical storage devices 
although the majority of our funding is internally generated  certain of our european subsidiaries have from time to time borrowed various european currencies under various bank agreements 
at march   outstanding balances under such agreements totaled million 
these borrowings have been used primarily for regional working capital requirements 
in fiscal  and  dividends of million  million and million  respectively  were paid to stockholders 
pursuant to a previously authorized stock repurchase program  we were authorized to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
we completed that authorization upon purchasing  shares at a cost of million during fiscal on april   the board of directors of the company authorized the repurchase of up to  additional shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market 
under this program we purchased  shares at a cost of million during fiscal and  shares at a cost of million during fiscal the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock and are available for general corporate purposes 
we have established reserves for our projected share of costs associated with the remediation of  and compliance with  environmental matters at various sites 
adjustments to such provisions and related expenditures have not been material in any of the years ended march   or based on our financial condition as of march   we believe that cash on hand and expected to be generated from operating activities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated financing needs for working capital  capital expenditures  environmental clean up costs  research  development and engineering expenses  any dividends and any stock repurchases during the next fiscal year 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein for additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies 
we do not anticipate any significant changes in our ability to generate or meet our liquidity needs in the long term 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our known significant obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain agreements as of march   as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied in thousands of dollars contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases material purchase obligations total page critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimate s 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our accounting policies and disclosure practices 
in management s opinion  the critical accounting estimates  as defined below  are more complex in nature and require a higher degree of judgment than the remainder of our accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein 
revenue recognition all of our products are built to specification and tested by avx for adherence to such specification before shipment to customers 
we ship products to customers based upon firm orders and revenue is recognized upon transfer of title of the products and when collectability is reasonably assured 
a portion of our sales are to independent electronics distributors under terms allowing the distributors certain limited rights of return within a six month period and price protection for actual sales at prices below anticipated sales prices at our discretion 
at the time we record sales to the distributors  we also provide an allowance against sales for estimated product returns and price protection liabilities based on historical experience and management s estimates of the potential impact of the business climate 
accounts receivable we report provisions for distributor adjustments as a reduction in revenue and provisions for bad debts as a component of selling expenses 
we review specific accounts for collectability based upon circumstances known to us at the date of our financial statements 
in addition  we maintain general reserves based upon historical billing adjustments and write offs 
these estimates are based upon historical discounts  concessions  bad debts  customer concentrations  changes in customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market realizable value 
we determine the cost of raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories by the first in  first out fifo method 
inventory costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the valuation of inventory requires us to make certain assumptions and judgments to estimate net realizable value 
inventories are adjusted for estimates of obsolescence or written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand  technology developments and market conditions 
page property and equipment and other long lived assets property and equipment are recorded at cost 
machinery and equipment are generally depreciated on the double declining balance method over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  we depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of property and equipment or closing of facilities could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets  including fixed assets and goodwill  are reviewed by us for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such assets may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the discounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the related assets  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
restructuring from time to time  we record charges relating to efforts to strategically reposition our operations 
these charges include estimates for termination costs for employees affected by plant closings and other reduction in force efforts 
the accruals are based on various factors including length of service  contract provisions  salary levels and governmental regulations 
at the date we approve a restructuring plan and satisfy other required accounting criteria  a liability for the estimated costs associated with that restructuring plan is established 
until the plan activities are completed  the actual cost may differ from the estimate 
we use judgments and information available at the date of the financial statements to reevaluate the initial estimate of the plan costs 
if circumstances change and previous estimates are no longer accurate  we adjust the reserve with a corresponding increase or decrease to current period earnings 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our tax assets and liabilities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
with the establishment of a valuation allowance or increases to the allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
we have recorded valuation allowances due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
page we also record a provision for certain international  federal and state tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation  when needed 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to challenges from us and non us tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
further  during the ordinary course of business  other changing facts and circumstances may impact our ability to utilize tax benefits as well as the estimated taxes to be paid in future periods 
management believes it has appropriately accrued for tax exposures 
if we are required to pay an amount less than or exceeding our provisions for uncertain tax matters  the financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the matter is resolved 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to adjust tax accounts which could materia lly impact our financial condition and results of operations 
pension assumptions pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets  are important elements of plan expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
we have little latitude in selecting this rate  as it is required to represent the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
these assumptions are evaluated peri odically and are updated to reflect our experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
contingencies we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning the environment in the united states and to the environmental laws and regulations of the other countries in which we operate 
based on our periodic review of the operating policies and practices at all of our facilities  we believe that our operations currently comply  in all material respects  with all of these laws and regulations 
regarding sites identified by the epa at which remediation is required  our ultimate liability in connection with environmental claims will depend on many factors  including its volumetric share of non environmentally safe waste  the total cost of remediation and the financial viability of other companies having liability 
once it becomes probable that we will incur costs in connection with remediation of a site and such costs can be reasonably estimated  we establish or adjust our reserves for our projected share of these costs 
these reserves do not reflect any possible future in surance recoveries  which are not expected to be significant  but do reflect a reasonable estimate of cost sharing at multiple party sites 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of sfas apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   the amortization and impairment provisions of sfas are effective upon the ado ption of sfas the company adopted sfas and sfas at the beginning of fiscal accordingly  we ceased amortizing goodwill effective april  resulting in a reduction of amortization costs of million during fiscal compared to fiscal we have reviewed our goodwill for impairment as required by sfas and determined that there was no impairment of assets

 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions in sfas for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used 
in addition  the statement provides more guidance on estimating cash flows when performing a recoverability test  requires that a long lived asset or group of assets to be disposed of other than by sale be classified as held and used until they are disposed of  and establishes more restrictive criteria to classify an asset or group of assets as held for sale 
sfas also retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement  but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
we adopted sfas at the beginning of fiscal  which had no impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency our european sales  which accounted for approximately of fiscal sales  generally are denominated in local currencies  while those in north america and asia generally are denominated in us dollars 
also  certain manufacturing and operating costs denominated in local currencies are incurred in europe  asia  mexico and central and south america 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and cash flow 
in order to minimize the effect of movements in currency exchange rates  we periodically enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge external and intercompany foreign currency transactions 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
currency exchange gains and losses have been immaterial during the periods presented 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in all european currencies against the us dollar  with the resulting functional currency gains and losses translated into us dollars at the spot rate  the resulting net loss would have an estimated million impact on our results before income taxes 
page materials we are at risk to fluctuations in prices for commodities used to manufacture our products  primarily palladium and tantalum 
palladium  a precious metal currently used in the manufacture of a small portion of our multi layer ceramic capacitors  is primarily purchased from various companies in the form of palladium sponge and ingot 
the main areas of mining of palladium are in russia and south africa 
palladium is considered a commodity and is subject to price volatility and has fluctuated in a range of approximately to  per troy ounce during the past three fiscal years 
the market price was approximately per troy ounce at march  we have addressed our use of palladium by i adjusting the manufacturing process for the parts made with palladium to reduce the amount of the precious metal used in each part  and ii substituting base metals  such as nickel  in the production of multi layer ceramic capacitors 
the majority of our commodity related ceramic capacitors are currently manufactured using nickel 
we accumulated palladium inventories during fiscal and based upon customer forecasted demand 
during fiscal  due to the sudden and significant decrease in demand and the ongoing conversion to nickel  palladium inventory levels exceeded our forecasted quantity requirements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a million charge for the write down of palladium to net realizable value 
in the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of increased demand for components using palladium  we began using the remaining balance of this excess palladium inventory in production
