item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors including  but not limited to  those under item business risk factors and liquidity and capital resources factors that may affect operating results and liquidity 
overview in october  ubiquitel llc  a limited liability company whose sole member was the walter group  entered into a management agreement with sprint pcs whereby it became the pcs affiliate of sprint with the exclusive right to provide digital  pcs services under the sprint and sprint pcs brand names in the reno tahoe market 
in november  ubiquitel llc assigned the management and related agreements to ubiquitel inc ubiquitel llc had no operations or financial transactions prior to the assignment of these agreements to ubiquitel 
in december  we expanded our management agreement with sprint pcs to include additional markets in the western and midwestern united states for markets under the agreement with a total of million residents 
until june   we were a development stage company with very limited operations and revenues  significant losses and substantial capital requirements 
in april  we acquired sprint pcs spokane  washington pcs network and related assets for million in cash 
we completed our initial public offering of common stock in in which we sold  shares for gross proceeds of approximately million 
we launched our markets during the period november through june in february  we entered into a merger agreement to acquire another pcs affiliate of sprint  via wireless llc  the exclusive sprint pcs provider to the central valley of california market 
we completed the mergers and related transactions in august  issuing million shares of common stock to the former via wireless owners  assuming approximately million of debt and incurring transaction costs of approximately million 
in october  we sold via wireless california pcs licenses to voicestream wireless for million in cash  resulting in net debt assumed in the via wireless acquisition of million 
concurrently with the acquisition  we amended our sprint pcs management agreement to include the central valley of california market with a total of million residents  bringing our licensed resident population under the agreement to approximately million 
as of december   we had approximately  subscribers 
as of december   our network covered approximately million residents which represents approximately of the licensed population in our markets 
from our inception on september  through december   we have incurred losses of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur net losses through at least from our inception through december   we have used approximately million in cash for operating activities and capital expenditures  exclusive of approximately million worth of network equipment acquired as part of the spokane market and via wireless purchases 
we also expect to continue to use cash for operating activities and capital expenditures through at least at december   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash and an unused revolving line of credit of approximately million 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included herein  our revolving line of credit was permanently reduced to million on february  we believe we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund capital expenditures  including the completion of our build out  working capital requirements and operating losses until we generate positive cash flow 
as a pcs affiliate of sprint  we do not own the licenses to operate our network and instead pay sprint pcs for the use of its licenses 
under our management agreement with sprint pcs  sprint pcs is entitled to receive of all collected revenue from sprint pcs subscribers based in our markets and fees from wireless service providers other than sprint pcs when their subscribers roam into our network 
we are entitled to of revenues collected from the sale of handsets and accessories from our stores and on roaming revenues received when sprint pcs customers from a different territory make a wireless call on our pcs network 
we are responsible for building  owning and managing the pcs network located in our markets under the sprint and sprint pcs brand names 
our results of operations are dependent on sprint pcs network and  to a lesser extent  on the networks of other pcs affiliates of sprint 
as a pcs affiliate of sprint  we purchase a full suite of support services from sprint pcs 
we have access to these services during the term of our management agreement unless sprint pcs provides us at least nine months advance notice of its intention to terminate any particular service 
we are purchasing customer billing and collections  customer care  subscriber activation including credit verification  handset logistics  network operations control center monitoring  national platform interconnectivity  voice mail  directory assistance and operator services  long distance and roaming clearinghouse services 
if sprint pcs significantly increases the amount it charges us for any of these services or requires us to purchase additional services  our operating expenses will increase and our operating income and available cash would be reduced 
if sprint pcs terminates any of these services  our operations may be interrupted or restricted 
critical accounting policies we rely on the use of estimates and make assumptions that impact our financial condition and results 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical results and trends as well as our forecasts as to how these might change in the future 
some of the most critical accounting policies that might materially impact our results include revenue recognition we recognize revenues when services have been rendered or products have been delivered  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record service revenues  consisting of subscriber revenues  sprint pcs travel revenues and non sprint pcs roaming revenues  and equipment revenues consisting of sales of handsets and accessories 
subscriber revenues consist of monthly recurring service charges and monthly non recurring charges for local  long distance  travel and roaming airtime usage in excess of the pre subscribed usage plan received from our subscribers  and cancellation and late fee revenues less reductions for billing adjustments and credits 
our revenue recognition policies are consistent with the guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  promulgated by the securities and exchange commission 
we recognize service revenue from our subscribers as they use the service 
we pro rate access revenue over the billing period and record airtime usage in excess of the pre subscribed usage plan 
our subscribers pay an activation fee to us when they initiate service 
we defer activation fee revenue and direct customer activation costs on a straight line basis over the average life of our subscribers  which is estimated to be months 
direct customer activation costs in excess of activation fee revenue are recognized immediately 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized approximately million  million and  respectively  of activation fee revenue 
we have deferred approximately million and million of activation fee revenue and related costs as of december  and  respectively  to future periods 
we record sprint pcs travel revenue on a per minute rate when a sprint pcs subscriber based outside our markets uses our network 
we earned approximately million  million and million of sprint pcs travel revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we record non sprint pcs roaming revenue when a non sprint pcs subscriber uses our network 
we earned approximately million  million and million of non sprint pcs roaming revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
equipment revenue consists of proceeds from sales of handsets and accessories which are recorded at the time of sale 
revenues from sales of handsets and accessories represent a separate earnings process from service revenues because sales of handsets and accessories do not require customers to subscribe to wireless services 
we account for rebates  discounts and other sales incentives as a reduction to revenue 
we participate in the sprint national and regional distribution programs in which national retailers such as radio shack  best buy and circuit city sell sprint pcs products and services 
in order to facilitate the sale of sprint pcs products and services  national retailers purchase wireless handsets from sprint for resale and receive compensation from sprint for sprint pcs products and services sold 
for industry competitive reasons  sprint subsidizes the price of these handsets by selling the handsets at a price below cost 
under our sprint pcs agreements  when a national retailer sells a handset purchased from sprint to a subscriber in our markets  we are obligated to reimburse sprint for the handset subsidy 
we do not receive any revenues from sales of handsets and accessories by national retailers 
for a new subscriber activation and a handset upgrade to an existing subscriber  we include these handset subsidy charges in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of operations 
handset subsidy charges included in cost of products sold for the years ended december   and were million  million and  respectively 
revenue and cost data provided by sprint pcs we place substantial reliance on the timeliness  accuracy and suffiency of certain revenue  accounts receivable and cost data provided by sprint which we use in the preparation of our financial statements and financial disclosures 
the data provided by sprint is the primary source for our recognition of service revenue and a significant portion of our selling and marketing and cost of service and operations expenses 
at times  we have been invoiced by sprint for charges that we believe to be contractually incorrect 
we review all charges from sprint and dispute certain of these charges based upon our interpretation of our agreements with sprint pcs and are attempting to work with sprint to improve the process 
when sprint does not notify us timely for charges that we have incurred or when we are invoiced for charges that we believe to be incorrect  we record estimates primarily based on our historical trends and our estimate for the amount which we believe we will remit to sprint after the disputed item or items have been settled 
valuation of accounts receivable and inventories reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining our allowance for bad debt and are based both on our historical collection experience  current trends and credit policy and on a percentage of our accounts receivables by aging category 
in determining these percentages  we look at historical write offs of our receivables and our history is limited 
we also look at current trends in the credit quality of our customer base and changes in the credit policies 
under the sprint pcs service plans  customers who do not meet certain credit criteria can nevertheless select any plan offered subject to an account spending limit  referred to as asl  to control credit exposure 
account spending limits range from to depending on the credit quality of the customer 
prior to may  all of these customers were required to make a deposit ranging from to that could be credited against future billings 
during the period from may to february  the deposit requirement was eliminated on all credit classes ndasl 
we re implemented deposit requirements for all new sub prime credit quality subscribers on the clear pay program in late february if these estimates are insufficient for any reason  our operating income and available cash would be reduced 
reserve for obsolete excess inventory we record a reserve for obsolete or excess handset and accessories inventory for models and accessories that are no longer manufactured  for defective models and accessories that have been returned by customers and a percentage of second generation handsets and accessories 
with the launch of our third generation xrtt network in the third quarter of  we have discontinued purchasing second generation handsets and accessories 
if we do not deplete the inventory that is not capable of providing xrtt services  we may have to increase our reserve for any remaining obsolete or excess inventory due to obsolescence 
if the estimate of obsolete inventory is understated  our operating income would be reduced 
long lived assets and goodwill effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is assessed based on the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment loss  if indicated  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets resulting from business combinations entered into prior to june  no longer be amortized  but instead be reviewed for recoverability  and that annual tests for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives be performed 
sfas no 
also requires interim tests when an event has occurred that more likely than not has reduced the fair value of such assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
reduced the amortization of goodwill by approximately million for the twelve months ended december  we will assess on an annual basis the fair values of the reporting unit housing the goodwill and intangibles and  if necessary  assess on an annual basis for any impairment 
any write offs would result in a charge to earnings and a reduction in equity in the period taken 
as of october   we completed our annual impairment review and determined that no impairment charge was required 
purchase price accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities purchased 
in our recording of the purchase of via wireless  we engaged a nationally recognized valuation expert to assist us in determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities 
included in the asset valuation for this purchase was the valuation of three intangible assets the via wireless subscriber base  the right to be the exclusive provider of sprint pcs services in the markets in which via wireless operated and the california pcs licenses subsequently sold to voicestream wireless 
for the subscriber base a useful life of months has been assigned effective april  for the period from the date of acquisition august  to march   the subscriber base was amortized using a useful life of months 
for the right to provide service under the sprint pcs management agreement  a useful life of years has been assigned 
in april  we acquired the spokane  washington market from sprint pcs 
included in the asset valuation for this purchase was the sprint pcs customer base for this market 
for the subscriber base a useful life of months has been assigned effective april  for the period from the date of acquisition in april to march   the subscriber base was amortized using a useful life of months 
each intangible asset will be amortized over its respective estimated useful life 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions of operation 
this process involves management estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
we then must assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
future taxable income depends on the ability to generate income in excess of allowable deductions 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies how to identify variable interest entities and how a company should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate the entity 
fin applies to variable interest entities created after january   in which a company obtains an interest after that date 
also  fin applies in the first fiscal quarter or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which a company holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we do not have any ownership in variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation from the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we will continue to account for our stock based compensation in accordance with apb no 
 and our adoption of sfas no 
requires us to provide prominent disclosures about the effects of sfas no 
on reported income in our interim financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation expands the disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees and requires that  at the inception of a guarantee  a guarantor recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements are effective immediately 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  ubiquitel has fully and unconditionally guaranteed operating company s obligations under its senior subordinated discount notes 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not expect the adoption of the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
among other items  eitf requires that consideration received from a vendor be presumed to be a reduction of the cost of the vendor s products or services 
this presumption can be overcome if the consideration can be shown to represent either a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor or a reimbursement of costs incurred by the reseller to sell the vendor s products 
this treatment is effective for arrangements entered into or modified on or after january  we have not yet determined the impact this issue will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements eitf 
eitf addresses the determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how the related revenues should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting  ie  the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
in applying this guidance  separate contracts with the same party  entered into at or near the same time  will be presumed to be a package  and the consideration will be measured and allocated to the separate units based on their relative fair values 
eitf will apply to revenue arrangements entered into after june   however  upon adoption  the eitf allows the guidance to be applied on a retroactive basis  with the change  if any  reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of operations 
we will adopt this new accounting guidance effective july  and have not yet determined the impact this issue will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
provides new guidance on the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
supercedes previous accounting guidance provided by eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
eitf required recognition of costs at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  our adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows as we have not recorded any significant restructuring charges in past periods  but the adoption may impact the timing of charges in future periods 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 

among other things  this statement rescinds fasb statement no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
as a result  the criteria in apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
our adoption of sfas no 
on january  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

this statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and capitalize that amount as part of the book value of the long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  our network is primarily located on leased property and we have certain legal obligations  principally related to our tower leases  which fall within the scope of sfas no 
these legal obligations primarily include certain obligations to remediate leased land on which our tower assets are located 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
effective january   we did not record asset retirement obligations for network infrastructure assets subject to the provisions of this statement as the fair value of the obligations could not reasonably be estimated 
we believe that uncertainty as to the eventual settlement of legal obligations exists due to trends in the wireless communications industry such as the rapid growth in minutes of use on wireless networks  increasing subscriber penetration and deployment of next generation technologies 
therefore  these factors increase the probability that third parties would not contractually enforce their remediation rights  to the extent they are present in our tower leases  related to the sites 
based on the combination of these industry trends  our limited obligations to remediate leased sites and our limited experience in remediating property  it is not probable that any sites will be removed in the foreseeable future and require remediation 
therefore  sufficient information to estimate a range of potential settlement dates is not available 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we will not recognize a liability until such information becomes known 
results of operations analysis of the years ended december  and on august   we acquired another pcs affiliate of sprint  via wireless llc  the exclusive sprint pcs provider to the central valley of california market 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly the operating results of via wireless have been included in the statement of operations from the date of acquisition 
we added approximately  subscribers as a result of the acquisition 
terms such as customer additions  churn  average revenue per user and cost per gross addition are metrics used in the wireless communications industry 
none of these terms are measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
customer net additions as of december   we provided personal communications services to approximately  customers  an increase of approximately  from december  during  we added  new subscribers  exclusive of approximately  customers acquired from via wireless in august the decrease in net subscribers acquired was attributable to slowing demand for digital wireless services from new subscribers  high customer churn and tighter credit policies 
churn churn is the monthly rate of customer turnover expressed as the percentage of customers of the beginning customer base that both voluntarily and involuntarily discontinued service during the period 
churn is computed by dividing the number of customers that discontinued service during the month  net of day returns  by the beginning customer base for the period 
churn for the year ended december  was approximately compared to for the year ended december  the increase in churn was primarily the result of an increase in the amount of former via wireless and no deposit account spending limit ndasl customers whose service was involuntarily discontinued during the year ended december  as compared to december  average revenue per user arpu average revenue per user arpu summarizes the average monthly service revenue per customer  excluding roaming revenue 
arpu is computed by dividing subscriber revenue by the average subscribers for the period 
during the years ended december  and  our arpu was approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in arpu was primarily due to customers acquired from via wireless in august who incurred billed air overages and whose service was involuntarily discontinued during cost per gross addition cpga cost per gross addition cpga summarizes the average cost to acquire new customers during the period 
cpga is computed by adding the income statement components of selling and marketing and the cost of products sold  and reducing that amount by the equipment revenue recorded 
that net amount is then divided by the gross customers acquired during the period 
cpga was approximately for the year ended december  compared to approximately for the year ended december  the increase in cpga primarily resulted from an increase in handset subsidies and handset upgrade costs and an increase in our commission payments for prime credit class customers that were recorded during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   offset by an increase in gross additions for the year ended december  as compared to december   which reduced fixed costs on a per add basis 
revenues subscriber revenue 
subscriber revenue during the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
subscriber revenue consists of monthly recurring service charges and monthly non recurring charges for local  long distance  travel and roaming airtime usage in excess of the pre subscribed usage plan received from our subscribers and cancellation and late fee revenues less reductions for billing adjustments and billing corrections 
our customers charges are dependent on their rate plans  based on the number of minutes and data usage included in their plans 
these plans generally reflect the terms of national plans offered by sprint pcs 
the increase in subscriber revenue was primarily attributable to the increase in our subscriber base 
sprint pcs travel revenue 
travel revenue is generated on a per minute rate when a sprint pcs subscriber based outside our markets uses our network 
an additional long distance rate per minute is generated when that customer initiates a call from our network to call outside the local calling area 
the travel rate was per minute of use from january  through june   when it was reduced to per minute of use 
beginning october  and continuing through december   the rate was per minute of use  for an average rate for the year ended december  of per minute based on total travel minutes 
for  the rate was reduced to per minute 
for  sprint pcs reduced the rate to per minute 
the long distance rate per minute for and was approximately per minute and per minute  respectively 
during the year ended december   our network captured approximately million of system travel minutes with approximately of those minutes generating long distance charges which resulted in approximately million in travel revenue 
during the year ended december   our network captured approximately million of system travel minutes with approximately of those minutes generating long distance charges which resulted in approximately million in travel revenue 
the increase in travel and long distance minutes of use represented million of travel revenue  offset by a million reduction to travel revenue due to the decrease in the reciprocal sprint pcs travel rate and a million reduction of long distance rate per minute 
non sprint pcs roaming revenue 
non sprint pcs roaming revenue is generated when a non sprint pcs subscriber uses our portion of the sprint pcs network 
we earned approximately million in non sprint pcs roaming revenue during the year ended december  compared to approximately million during the year ended december  non sprint pcs roaming minutes increased from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the increase in roaming minutes represented a million increase in revenue  and the decrease in the average non sprint pcs roaming revenue rate we receive from other carriers represented an million reduction of roaming revenue 
equipment revenue 
equipment revenue is generated from the sales of handsets and accessories and is recorded at the time of sale 
we record and retain of the revenue from sales of handsets and accessories  net of rebates  discounts and other sales incentives  as equipment revenue 
the amounts recorded during the years ended december  and from equipment revenue totaled approximately million and million  respectively  and the decrease was primarily due to an increase in equipment promotions and discounts in order to acquire more customers  offset by an increase in gross additions 
cost of service and operations network operations expenses 
network operations expenses include radio communications site lease costs  utilities  network control maintenance  network control site leases  engineering personnel  transport facilities and interconnect charges  and totaled approximately million during the year ended december  compared to approximately million during the year ended december  the increase in network operations expenses was attributable to a full year of results for the former via wireless market and several of the original markets that launched service during the first half of sprint pcs travel expense 
we pay sprint pcs travel fees on a per minute rate when our customers use the sprint pcs network outside our markets and incur additional long distance fees when our customer calls long distance originating in a sprint pcs or pcs affiliate of sprint territory 
during the year ended december   our customers generated approximately million of travel minutes with approximately of those minutes generating long distance charges which resulted in approximately million in travel fees 
during the year ended december   our customers generated approximately million of travel minutes with approximately of those minutes generating long distance charges which resulted in approximately million in travel fees 
the increase in travel expense was attributable to the million minutes of use increase from the year ended december  to the year ended december   which accounted for million in additional expense  offset by a positive variance of million resulting from the changes in the reciprocal rate received from sprint pcs  and million attributable to the reduction of the long distance rate per minute 
as discussed above  the per minute rate we pay sprint pcs when customers from our markets roam onto sprint pcs or another sprint pcs affiliate s network and the long distance rate per minute of use both decreased in as compared to and decreased again in to per minute 
for  we expect an increase in travel fees resulting from increasing subscriber levels in our markets to be partially offset by the lower per minute travel and long distance rates paid to sprint pcs 
non sprint pcs roaming expense 
we pay roaming fees to other wireless providers when our customers use their network 
during the year ended december   our customers generated approximately million of roaming minutes resulting in approximately million in roaming fees 
during the year ended december   our customers generated approximately million of roaming minutes resulting in approximately million in roaming fees 
the increase in roaming expense was attributable to the million minutes of use increase from the year ended december  to the year ended december   which accounted for million in additional expense  offset by a positive variance of million representing a reduction of roaming expense due to a decrease in the average non sprint pcs roaming revenue rate paid to other carriers 
bad debt expense 
bad debt expense during the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in bad debt expense was primarily attributable to expense from sub prime credit quality customers on the ndasl program that was in effect from may through late february and customers acquired from via wireless in august operating expenses 
operating expenses during the years ended december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
operating expenses included fees we paid to sprint pcs for the use of their support services  including billing and collections services and customer care 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in our subscriber base  in addition to increases in fees charged by sprint for their services 
cost of products sold the cost of products sold included the costs of handsets and accessories and totaled approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the cost of handsets exceeds the retail sales price because we subsidize the cost of handsets  consistent with industry practice 
the increase in cost of products sold was primarily attributable to the increase in gross sales and inventory reserves that were recorded during handset subsidies on units sold by third parties totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses relate to our distribution channels  sales representatives  sales support personnel  retail stores  advertising programs and commissions 
we incurred expenses of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in gross customer additions 
general and administrative we incurred general and administrative expenses excluding non cash expenses totaling approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses included approximately million and million of management fee expense defined as of collected revenues paid to sprint pcs during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the increase in management fee expense resulting from the increase in our subscriber base and to the increase in compensation and benefits related to the growth in the number of our employees 
non cash compensation for general and administrative matters during the years ended december  and  non cash compensation for general and administrative matters totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
we apply the provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our equity incentive plan 
unearned stock option compensation is recorded for the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of our stock at the date of grant and is recognized as non cash stock option compensation expense in the period in which the related services are rendered 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended december  and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
we depreciate our property and equipment using the straight line method over four to years 
a building acquired as part of the via wireless acquisition is being depreciated using the straight line method over years 
amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is over months to years 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a full year of expense for the assets acquired from via wireless and the majority of network assets that were placed into service during the first half of interest income for the years ended december  and  interest income was approximately million and million  respectively 
the interest income was generated from cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash balances 
the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower levels of cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash combined with lower interest rates during the year ended december  than during the year ended december  interest expense interest expense totaled approximately million during the year ended december  we accrued interest at a rate of per annum on our senior subordinated discount notes 
interest on our senior credit facility was accrued at the london interbank offered rate based on contracts ranging from to days 
interest expense also included the amortized amount of deferred financing fees relating to our senior credit facility and senior subordinated discount notes 
during the year ended december   interest expense was approximately million 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher debt levels during the year ended december  than during the year ended december  and an increase in amortization of deferred financing fees 
income taxes for the year ended december   we recognized an income tax benefit of million  and for the year ended december  we recognized an income tax expense of approximately million 
approximately million of the tax benefit recorded during the year ended december  is expected to be monetized in the first half of as we expect to carryback net operating losses from our wholly owned via holding subsidiary to realize a federal income tax refund for taxes that had been previously paid by one of the acquired via wireless member companies 
the remaining million tax benefit that was recorded during the year ended december  was due to consolidating net operating loss carryforwards that have reduced the net deferred tax liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
net loss for the years ended december  and  our net loss was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in net loss of million resulted primarily from the items discussed above 
analysis of the years ended december  and customer net additions as of december   we provided personal communications services to approximately  customers compared to approximately  customers as of december  the increase in net subscribers acquired was attributable to our significant network expansion during the year ended december  and the acquisition of approximately  customers from via wireless on august  average revenue per user arpu during the years ended december  and  our arpu was approximately and  respectively 
cost per gross addition cpga cpga was approximately for the year ended december  compared to approximately for the year ended december  the decrease in cpga primarily resulted from the increase in our gross additions which reduced our fixed costs on a per unit basis 
revenues subscriber revenue 
subscriber revenue during the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in subscriber revenue was primarily attributable to the increase in our subscriber base 
sprint pcs travel revenue

equipment revenue 
the amounts recorded during the years ended december  and for equipment revenue totaled approximately million and million  respectively  and the increase was primarily due to an increase in gross sales to new pcs subscribers 
we offer sales incentives to customers based on participation in sprint pcs nationwide plans or on some company specific incentive programs 
some of these incentives result in a reduction of customer invoices 
during the fourth quarter of the year  we adopted the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives eitf  which calls for recognition of sales incentives that result in a reduction in or refund of the selling price of a product as a reduction in revenue 
following the adoption of eitf in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a reduction in revenue of approximately million

operating expenses during the years ended december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the increase in our subscriber base 
cost of products sold the cost of products sold totaled approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of products sold was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross customer additions of approximately  handset subsidies on units sold by third parties totaled approximately million and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
selling and marketing we incurred selling and marketing expenses of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in gross customer additions of approximately  while being partially offset by lower cpga rates 
general and administrative we incurred general and administrative expenses excluding non cash expenses totaling approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses included approximately million and million of management fee expense defined as of collected service revenues paid to sprint pcs during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased compensation and benefits related to the growth in the number of our employees and the increase in management fee expense attributable to the increase in our subscriber base 
non cash compensation for general and administrative matters during the years ended december  and  non cash compensation for general and administrative matters totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended december  and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to network assets that were placed into service during the first half of and amortization of the spokane customer list 
interest income for the years ended december  and  interest income was approximately million and million  respectively 
the interest income was generated from invested cash proceeds resulting from our private equity sales  our initial public offering  senior subordinated discount notes and drawings under our senior secured credit facility 
the proceeds were invested in short term liquid investments 
the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents and lower interest rates during the year ended december  than during the year ended december  interest expense interest expense totaled approximately million during the year ended december  interest on our senior credit facility was accrued at the prime rate plus a specified margin until may and was subsequently rolled under the reserve adjusted london interbank offered rate  based on contracts ranging from to days 
during the year ended december   interest expense was approximately million 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher debt levels during the year ended december  than during the year ended december  net loss for the years ended december  and  our net loss was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in net loss of million resulted primarily from the items discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources from inception to june   the period during which we were a development stage company  our activities consisted principally of raising capital  consummating and supporting our agreements with sprint pcs  developing the initial design of our pcs network and adding to our management team 
through december   we have principally relied on the proceeds from equity and debt financings  and to a lesser extent revenues  as our primary sources of capital 
during late  we moved from a construction and build out phase to an operational phase 
completion of our pcs network required substantial capital  of which approximately million has been incurred through december  although we have substantially completed our network coverage build out  our business could require additional capital expenditures of up to approximately million annually for maintenance  capacity enhancements and coverage improvements  including up to approximately million in the aggregate to comply with the minimum build out requirements of our management agreement with sprint pcs 
our build out plan included the installation and or acquisition of five switches and approximately radio communications sites by the end of as of december   we had retail stores in operation in our markets 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash and an unused revolving line of credit of approximately million 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included herein  our revolving line of credit was permanently reduced to million on february  cash and cash equivalents and cash availability under our senior secured credit facility  combined with cash flow from operations  are expected to be sufficient to fund any operating losses and working capital  to meet capital expenditure needs and to service debt requirements through december  and into the foreseeable future 
due to a number of factors  including the rapidly changing wireless industry  general economic uncertainty  lower than expected new subscriber additions  continuing higher rates of customer turnover than anticipated  the recent change to the reciprocal travel rate with sprint pcs taking effect in  and potential changes to the roaming rates  we may generate positive cash flows from operations less capital expenditures a year or two later than originally projected  which was net cash used by operating activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for the periods was primarily attributable to the operating loss being partly offset by non cash items and cash sourced from working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  and net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures of approximately million  offset by a reduction in restricted cash of approximately million and cash received from the sale of equipment of approximately million 
for the year ended december   in addition to capital expenditures of approximately million  investing activities included acquisition costs relating to the acquisition of via wireless and a cash advance to  net of cash acquired from  via wireless of approximately million 
cash provided by investing activities included million released from restricted cash and million in proceeds from the sale of via wireless california pcs licenses 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of million in funding under the senior secured credit facility  offset by million in capital lease and other long term liabilities payments and million in deferred financing fees in connection with the july amendment to the senior secured credit facility 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of million in funding under the senior secured credit facility  offset by approximately million in long term debt repayments 
debt repayments included payments made under our capital lease obligations  the pay down of the rural telephone finance cooperative senior secured credit facility of via wireless  and the pay down of the outstanding federal communications commission notes for the california pcs licenses assumed in the via wireless acquisition 
in addition  we incurred million in deferred financing fees in connection with the increase in our senior secured credit facility related to the via wireless acquisition 
liquidity at december   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash and an unused revolving line of credit of approximately million 
the availability of the revolving credit line is subject to continued compliance with restrictive covenants under our senior secured credit facility  however  there is uncertainty as to our ability to continue to comply with such covenants prior to generating positive cash flow from operations less capital expenditures 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included herein  our revolving line of credit was permanently reduced to million on february  through  we have used proceeds from our initial public offering of equity  our senior subordinated discount notes  borrowings from our senior secured credit facility  and to a lesser extent revenues  to fund capital expenditures  operating losses  working capital and cash interest needs while we built out our pcs network and acquired customers 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  on february   we consummated three related transactions that will reduce our total debt by approximately million and cash interest requirements by approximately million in and approximately million annually beginning in  providing cumulative savings of approximately million 
we completed a private placement exchange offer of million aggregate principal amount of operating company s new senior discount notes due may  and million in cash for million aggregate principal amount of operating company s outstanding senior subordinated discount notes  and we also completed in a private placement a related new financing of million aggregate principal amount of operating company s series b senior discount notes due in which we received cash proceeds of million to fund the cash portion of the exchange 
we issued detachable warrants with the series b senior discount notes to purchase approximately million shares of ubiquitel common stock 
in connection with the exchange  ubiquitel and the senior lenders under our senior secured credit facility amended the credit facility to gain the lenders consent to the exchange offer  which terms included a million partial prepayment against our outstanding million principal balance of term loans and the reduction of the unused million revolving line of credit to million as of february  the amendment also required us to fund the entire cash portion of the exchange offer through the related financing described above 
we may from time to time purchase senior subordinated discount notes that remain outstanding in the open market  in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable law 
we believe our financial position will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of the business including capital expenditures  operating losses  cash interest  required amortization of principal under our senior secured credit facility and working capital needs 
our projections contain significant assumptions including projections for gross new customer additions  arpu  churn  cpga  bad debt expense and roaming revenue 
should actual results differ significantly from these assumptions  our liquidity position could be adversely affected and we could be in a position that would require us to raise additional capital which may not be available or may not be available on acceptable terms 
factors that may affect operating results and liquidity in addition to the risk factors included in item business  the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and liquidity and could cause actual events to differ materially from those predicted in forward looking statements related to our business 
we may not be able to sustain our growth or obtain sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability 
if the current trend of slower net customer growth continues  it will lengthen the amount of time it will take for us to attain a sufficient number of customers to generate positive cash flows less capital expenditures  which in turn will have a negative effect on liquidity and capital resources 
for the year ended december   we used approximately million in cash for operating activities and capital expenditures 
our business projections reflect continuing growth in our subscriber base and a reduction and eventual elimination of operating losses and negative cash flows as the cash flow generated by the growing subscriber base exceeds costs incurred to acquire new customers 
if we acquire more new customers than we project  the upfront costs to acquire those customers including the handset subsidy  commissions and promotional expenses may result in greater cash used in the near term but provide greater cash flows in later periods 
in addition  if there is a slowdown in new subscriber growth in our markets or the wireless industry generally  we may acquire fewer new customers  which would result in lower cash needs in the near term but provide lower cash flows in later periods 
we re instated the deposit requirement for new sub prime credit customers in late february in connection with the sprint pcs clear pay program 
the re instatement of deposits had a significant impact on gross customer additions during the last five weeks of the three months ended march  and during the remainder of while deposits for clear pay customers provide us with protection against bad debt expense for sub prime customers  it has and may continue to deter some people with sub prime credit from becoming subscribers 
as a result  our gross additions may decline 
as of december   of our approximate  subscribers had a credit rating placing them in the sub prime category  of which had deposits 
if the deposit requirement for new sub prime credit customers continues to deter some potential customers with sub prime credit from becoming subscribers  we may acquire fewer new customers  which would result in lower operating losses in the near term but provide lower cash flows in later periods 
we received notice from sprint pcs that our reciprocal travel rate changed from per minute in to per minute in  and there can be no assurance that it will not be reduced further in future years 
we are paid a fee from sprint pcs for every minute that a sprint pcs subscriber based outside of our markets uses our network  we refer to such fees as travel revenue 
similarly  we pay a fee to sprint for every minute that our customers use the sprint pcs network outside of our markets  we refer to such fees as travel expense 
under our original agreement with sprint pcs  the reciprocal travel rate exchanged for customers who roam into the other party s or another pcs affiliate s network  was established at per minute 
the travel rate was reduced from the original per minute of use to per minute of use beginning june   and to per minute of use beginning october  the rate was reduced to per minute for with a travel in to travel out ratio of approximately two to one during the year ended december  and an expected continued favorable net travel position in the next few years  the lower travel rate has increased our operating losses and could further increase our expected operating losses and reduce our liquidity projections during the next two or three years 
we project that growth in our customer base will result in a ratio of travel revenue to travel expense approaching one to one in the long term  minimizing the net earnings and the operating loss impact of any substantial reduction in the travel rate during those later years 
we place substantial reliance on the timeliness  accuracy and sufficiency of revenue and cost data and information generated by sprint for the compilation of our financial statements and other financial disclosures  including substantial portions of our revenues  expenses and accounts receivable 
as part of our agreements  we outsource several functions to sprint including billing  customer care  national network operations support  inventory logistics support  long distance transport and national retailer sales support 
the data provided by sprint is the primary source for our recognition of service revenue and a significant portion of our selling and marketing and cost of service and operations expenses 
in certain cases  the data is provided at a level of detail that is not adequate for us to verify for accuracy back to the originating source 
we rely on sprint to have designed adequate internal controls with respect to the processes established to provide this data 
because of this reliance  we are dependent on sprint to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of these controls and report any significant deficiencies and weaknesses in the design or operation of these controls that could have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
sprint provides an annual evaluation of these controls to us by engaging its independent auditors to provide a report on controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness for affiliates under guidance provided in statement of auditing standards no 
sas 
there can be no assurance that the sas procedures will identify all weaknesses that might be material to us 
although we are not presently aware of any material errors affecting us  errors that are not reconciled on a timely basis by sprint could cause us to misstate our revenues or expenses and could result in out of period adjustments that may materially adversely affect our financial results and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  if we or any other pcs affiliate of sprint find significant errors in information provided by sprint which causes a restatement of financial statements or otherwise affects us  investors and the investment community may lose confidence in us 
in late february  ipcs  inc  a pcs affiliate of sprint  filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code and concurrently brought an adversarial action against sprint alleging  among other things  that sprint had failed to remit certain amounts owed to ipcs under its agreements with sprint 
should sprint fail to deliver timely  accurate and sufficient information  this could lead to a greater degree of uncertainty in our business and financial planning and may lead to adverse short term decisions 
in addition  the failure of sprint to remit current or future amounts owing to pcs affiliates of sprint  including us  could lead to actions on the part of us or other pcs affiliates of sprint to enforce rights under the sprint agreements and other remedies available under applicable law 
our ability to borrow funds under our senior secured credit facility s million revolving line of credit will be restricted unless our cash balance as defined in the credit facility is less than million at the time of borrowing and could be terminated due to our failure to maintain or comply with the restrictive financial and operating covenants contained in the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are currently in compliance with all financial and operational covenants relating to the senior secured credit facility  however  there is uncertainty as to our ability to continue to comply with such covenants prior to generating positive cash flow from operations less capital expenditures 
if we are unable to operate our business within the covenants specified in the senior secured credit facility  our ability to obtain future amendments to the covenants in the senior secured credit facility is not guaranteed and our ability to make borrowings under the revolving line of credit required to operate our business could be restricted or terminated 
such a restriction or termination would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
variable interest rates may increase substantially 
at december   we had million outstanding under our senior credit facility  which was subsequently reduced to million on february  due to a million prepayment described above under liquidity 
the rate of interest on the facility is presently based on a margin above the london interbank offered rate libor 
our weighted average borrowing rate on variable rate borrowings was for the year ended december  increases in a market interest rate substantially above our estimates may result in unanticipated cash interest costs 
we may not be able to access the credit markets for additional capital if the liquidity discussed above is insufficient for the cash needs of our business 
we frequently evaluate options for additional financings to supplement our liquidity position and maintain maximum financial flexibility 
however  if the assumptions used in our projections are incorrect  we may be unable to raise additional capital 
capital resources the senior subordinated discount notes  the senior discount notes and the series b senior discount notes will require cash payments of interest beginning on october  as of december   our senior secured credit facility provided for a million revolving loan  a term loan a of million and a term loan b of million 
the term loans a and b  all of which were outstanding as of december   are required to be repaid beginning in june in fourteen and eighteen consecutive quarterly installments  respectively 
the revolving loan and term loan a will mature in october and the term loan b will mature in october as discussed above under liquidity  the term loans outstanding have been reduced to million and the revolving line of credit to million as of february  the commitment fee on unused borrowings is  payable quarterly 
our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by all of our assets 
the senior secured credit facility is subject to certain restrictive covenants including the timing of availability for borrowing under the million revolving line of credit  maintaining certain financial ratios  attaining defined subscriber growth goals  network covered population goals and minimum quarterly service revenues  and limiting annual capital expenditures 
as of december   management believes that we were in compliance with all financial and operational covenants associated with our senior secured credit facility  senior subordinated discount notes and the sprint pcs management agreement 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures we utilize certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  to assess our financial performance 
a non gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that a excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows  or b includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented 
the non gaap financial measures discussed in results of operations are average revenue per user arpu and cost per gross addition cpga 
descriptions of these non gaap financial measures are provided where the particular measures are discussed in results of operations analysis of the years ended december  and  and the following tables reconcile the non gaap financial measures with our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  average revenue per user arpu service revenue    less travel revenue    less roaming revenue    subscriber revenue    average subscribers    arpu minor differences from numbers appearing in results of operations may exist due to rounding the numbers in results of operations to the nearest million 
average subscribers for the year ended december  was calculated using months of average subscribers due to the april acquisition of the spokane  washington market 
we believe arpu  which calculates the average monthly service revenue per customer  excluding roaming revenue  is a useful measure to assist in forecasting our future subscriber revenue 
in addition  it provides a gauge to compare our service revenue to that of other wireless communications providers  although other wireless communications providers may include or exclude certain items from their calculations which may make the comparison less meaningful 
year ended december  cost per gross addition cpga selling and marketing    add cost of products sold    less equipment revenue    less selling and marketing adjustment  cpga costs    gross additions    cpga the adjustment to selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  represents selling and marketing costs incurred prior to the launch of a market 
we believe cpga  which measures the average cost to acquire new customers during the period  is a useful measure used to compare our average cost to acquire a new subscriber to that of other wireless communication providers  although other wireless communications providers may include or exclude certain items from their calculations which may make the comparison less meaningful 
contractual obligations we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts we have entered into  including amounts pursuant to our senior secured credit facility  noncancelable operating lease agreements for office space  retail stores  land for radio communications sites  leased space on radio communications sites and office equipment  capital leases  the via wireless building mortgage and other long term liabilities  the senior subordinated discount notes  the senior discount notes  and the series b senior discount notes 
the following table lists our expected future minimum contractual cash obligations for the next five years and in the aggregate  and reflects each of the transactions consummated on february   which are described below following the table dollars in thousands payments due by period years ending december  contractual obligation total thereafter senior secured credit facility    operating leases      capital leases building mortgage and other long term liabilities  senior subordinated discount notes  senior discount notes   series b senior discount notes  total repayments  excluding interest payments  are based on borrowings outstanding as of february   and do not include projected borrowings under the senior secured credit facility

there are provisions in each of the agreements governing the senior secured credit facility  the senior subordinated discount notes  the senior discount notes and the series b senior discount notes that provide for an acceleration of repayment upon an event of default  as defined in the respective agreements 
on february   operating company consummated its private placement exchange of million aggregate principal amount of its new senior discount notes due may  and million in cash for million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding senior subordinated discount notes 
additionally  operating company consummated a related new financing  in a private placement offering  of million aggregate principal amount of series b senior discount notes due in which operating company received cash proceeds of million to fund the cash portion of the exchange 
under the new financing  we issued detachable warrants to purchase approximately million shares of ubiquitel common stock 
we wrote off approximately million in deferred financing fees related to the original issuance of the senior subordinated discount notes  and we incurred fees and expenses of approximately million in connection with the issuance of the new senior discount notes  which will reduce the gain resulting from the exchange offer  and we incurred fees and expenses of approximately million in connection with the issuance of the series b senior discount notes 
three directors of ubiquitel or their affiliates participated in the private placement offering for consideration of approximately million  and were issued approximately million aggregate principal amount of series b senior discount notes and approximately million detachable warrants 
as a condition to these transactions  our senior lenders required us to prepay million of our outstanding senior secured credit facility  thereby reducing the outstanding term loans under the senior secured credit facility to million 
in addition  the million unused revolving line of credit was permanently reduced by million to million 
we have followed the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings sfas no 
 and eitf issue no 
 determining whether a debtor s modification or exchange of debt instruments is within the scope of fasb statement  in recording these transactions 
these provisions require that the carrying value of the new senior discount notes be recorded at the total future cash payments principal and interest specified by the notes  therefore  these notes will be classified on our balance sheet as long term liabilities and were valued at million as of february  as a result  no interest expense related to these notes will be recognized in future periods 
the following table presents the aggregate gain recognized in the transactions dollars in thousands principal amount of senior subordinated discount notes as of february  unamortized discount on senior subordinated discount notes  unamortized discount on detachable warrants  unamortized deferred financing costs  carrying value of debt exchanged  maximum future cash principal payments for senior discount notes  maximum future cash interest payments for senior discount notes  cash payments for amount of debt exchanged  direct expenses of exchange transaction  aggregate gain from exchange transaction  following the exchange  we will have no interest expense with respect to the new senior discount notes due to the accounting treatment of the new senior discount notes under the provisions of sfas no 
as a result of these transactions  we will reduce overall debt by approximately million aggregate principal amount million aggregate accreted value and cash interest requirements by approximately million in and approximately million beginning in  providing cumulative savings of approximately million 
we believe that we will be able to make future payments on our debt and to fund our operations until we generate positive cash flow 
we anticipate that we will not need to raise additional cash in order to repay the new senior discount notes and the series b senior discount notes at their maturity 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had  and will not have  a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
seasonality our business is seasonal because the wireless industry is heavily dependent on fourth quarter results 
among other things  the industry relies on significantly higher customer additions and handset sales in the fourth quarter as compared to the other three fiscal quarters 
the factors contributing to this trend include the increasing use of retail distribution  which is dependent on year end holiday shopping  the timing of new product and service offerings  competitive pricing pressures and aggressive marketing and promotions during the holiday season 
the increased level of activity requires a greater use of our available financial resources during this period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to interest rate risk on our senior secured credit facility and any future financing requirements 
our fixed rate debt consisted primarily of the accreted carrying value of the senior subordinated discount notes million at december  
our variable rate debt consisted of borrowings made under the senior secured credit facility million at december  
our primary interest rate risk exposures related to i the interest rate on long term borrowings  ii our ability to refinance the senior subordinated discount notes at maturity at market rates  and iii the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet interest expense requirements and financial covenants under our debt instruments 
we may decide  from time to time  to manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding long term debt through the use of fixed and variable rate debt and interest rate swaps 
while we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt  we continue to evaluate our interest rate risk on an ongoing basis 
the following table presents the estimated future balances of outstanding long term debt projected at the end of each period and future required annual principal payments for each period then ended based on our projected level of long term indebtedness and reflects each of the transactions consummated on february  dollars in thousands years ending december  senior subordinated discount notes     fixed interest rate principal repayments senior secured credit facility variable interest rate principal payments      senior discount notes fixed interest rate principal repayments series b senior discount notes fixed interest rate principal repayments the interest rate on the senior secured credit facility equals the london interbank offered rate libor plus a weighted average interest rate of 
libor is assumed to equal for  and for years   and a increase decrease in the variable interest rate would result in an approximate million increase decrease in the interest expense 
the senior discount notes were issued at a discount in february  but we have followed the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings  and eitf issue no 
 determining whether a debtor s modification or exchange of debt instruments is within the scope of fasb statement these provisions require that the carrying value be recorded at the total future cash payments principal and interest 
therefore  the notes will be carried on our balance sheet as long term liabilities and were valued at million as of february  as a result  no interest expense related to these notes will be recognized in future periods
