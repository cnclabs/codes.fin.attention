item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general in this report  unless the context requires otherwise  references to we  us  our  or the company are intended to mean kinder morgan  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
specifically  as discussed in notes  and of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  we have engaged in acquisitions including the october acquisition of kinder morgan delaware  inc  the indirect owner of the general partner interest in kinder morgan energy partners  lp  a publicly traded master limited partnership  referred to in this report as kinder morgan energy partners  and divestitures including the discontinuance of certain lines of business and the transfer of certain assets to kinder morgan energy partners that may affect comparisons of financial position and results of operations between periods 
business strategy our business strategy is to i focus on fee based energy transportation and storage assets that are core to the energy infrastructure of growing markets  ii increase utilization of existing assets while controlling costs  iii make selected incremental acquisitions  iv maximize the benefits of our financial structure as discussed following and v continue to align employee and shareholder incentives 
during  we implemented plans to dispose of our non core businesses and as of december   we effectively completed the disposition of these assets and operations  all as more fully described in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the cash proceeds from these dispositions were largely used to retire debt  contributing to the reduction in outstanding indebtedness during in addition to sales of non core assets to third parties  we made significant contributions of assets to kinder morgan energy partners at the end of and the end of that  in total  had over billion of fair market value 
by contributing assets to kinder morgan energy partners that are accretive to its earnings and cash flow  we receive fair market value in the contribution transaction  while still maintaining an indirect interest in the earnings and cash flows of the assets through our limited and general partner interests in kinder morgan energy partners 
at december   we owned  directly  and indirectly in the form of i units corresponding to the number of shares of kinder morgan management  llc we owned  approximately million limited partner units of kinder morgan energy partners 
these units  which consist of million common units  million class b units and million i units  represent approximately percent of the total limited partner interests of kinder morgan energy partners 
in addition  we are the sole stockholder of the general partner of kinder morgan energy partners  which holds an effective percent interest in kinder morgan energy partners and its operating partnerships 
together  our limited partner and general partner interests represented approximately percent of kinder morgan energy partners total equity interests at december  we receive quarterly distributions on the i units owned by kinder morgan management in additional i units and distributions on our other units in cash 
in addition to distributions received on our limited partner interests and our kinder morgan management shares as discussed above  we also receive an incentive distribution from kinder morgan energy partners as a result of our ownership of the general partner interest in kinder morgan energy partners 
this incentive distribution is calculated in increments based on the amount by which quarterly distributions to unit holders exceed specified target levels as set forth in kinder morgan energy partners partnership agreement  reaching a maximum of of distributions allocated to the general partner for distributions above per limited partner unit 
including both our general and limited partner interests in kinder morgan energy partners  at the distribution level  we received approximately of all quarterly distributions made by kinder morgan energy partners  of which approximately is attributable to our general partner interest and is attributable to our limited partner interest 
the actual level of distributions we will receive in the future will vary with the level of distributable cash determined in accordance with kinder morgan energy partners partnership agreement 
we reflect our investment in kinder morgan energy partners under the equity method of accounting and  accordingly  report our share of kinder morgan energy partners earnings as equity in earnings in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such earnings are reported by kinder morgan energy partners 
after the dispositions discussed above  our remaining businesses constitute four business segments 
our largest business segment and our primary source of operating income is natural gas pipeline company of america  which owns and operates a major interstate natural gas pipeline system that runs from natural gas producing areas in west texas and the gulf of mexico to its principal market area of chicago  illinois 
in accordance with our strategy to increase operational focus on core assets  we have worked toward renewing existing agreements and entering into new agreements to fully utilize the transportation and storage capacity of natural gas pipeline company of america s system 
as a result  natural gas pipeline company of america sold virtually all of its capacity through the winter season 
natural gas pipeline company of america continues to pursue opportunities to connect its system to power generation facilities and  in addition  has extended its system to east st 
louis  illinois 
our other business segments consist of i our transcolorado pipeline system  a mile natural gas pipeline and related facilities extending from approximately miles east of meeker  colorado to bloomfield  new mexico  ii our retail distribution of natural gas to approximately  customers in colorado  wyoming and nebraska and iii our investment in  and  in some cases  operation of  electric power generation facilities 
the transcolorado pipeline system receives gas from two coal seam natural gas treating plants located in the san juan basin of colorado and from pipeline and gathering system interconnections within the paradox and piceance basins of western colorado 
we purchased the remaining percent interest in the transcolorado pipeline that we did not already own from questar corp 
in the fourth quarter of and have announced plans to expand and extend the system see transcolorado pipeline following and note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
our retail natural gas distribution operations are located  in part  in areas where significant growth is occurring and we expect to participate in that growth through increased natural gas demand 
our power segment owns interests in and  in some cases  operates power generation facilities and continues to hold preferred investments in two gas fired power plants constructed by us and placed into operation in during the fourth quarter of  we announced that we were discontinuing our power development activities and we revalued certain of our power assets 
see power and other following and note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
with respect to financial strategy  it is our intention to maintain a relatively conservative capital structure that provides flexibility and stability 
during  we utilized cash that we generated from operations to fund capital expenditures  increase our ownership of the transcolorado pipeline to percent and to reacquire approximately million of our common stock pursuant to a previously announced million stock buyback program 
at december   our total debt to total capital was approximately  down from over in late  with approximately of our debt subject to floating interest rates 
we believe that we will continue to benefit from accretive acquisitions and business expansions  primarily by kinder morgan energy partners 
kinder morgan energy partners has a multi year history of making accretive acquisitions  which benefit us through our limited and general partner interests 
this acquisition strategy is expected to continue  with the availability of potential acquisition candidates being driven by consolidation in the energy industry  as well as realignment of asset portfolios by major energy companies  although we can provide no assurance that such acquisitions will occur in the future 
in addition  we expect to expand  within strict guidelines as to risk  rate of return and timing of cash flows  both natural gas pipeline company of america s and transcolorado pipeline s pipeline systems and acquire natural gas retail distribution properties that fit well with our current profile 
it is our intention to carry out the above strategy  modified as necessary to reflect changing economic and other circumstances 
however  as discussed under risk factors elsewhere in this report  there are factors that could affect our ability to carry out our strategy or affect its level of success even if carried out 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and contained within this report 
certain amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosure must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures  we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable  unbilled revenues for our natural gas distribution deliveries for which meters have not yet been read  exposures under contractual indemnifications and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
however  we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others 
in our retail natural gas distribution business  because we read customer meters on a cycle basis  we are required to estimate the amount of revenue earned as the end of each period for which service has been rendered but meters have not yet been read 
we have available historical information for these meters and  together with weather related data that affects natural gas demand  we are able to make reliable estimates 
in our natural gas pipeline businesses  we are similarly required to make estimates for services rendered but for which actual metered volumes are not available at reporting dates 
as with our retail natural gas distribution business  we have historical data available to assist us in the estimation process  but the variations in volume are greater  introducing a larger possibility of error 
we believe our estimates  which are corrected to reflect actual metered volumes in the next accounting month  provide acceptable approximations of the actual revenue earned during any period  especially given that the majority of our revenues in the pipeline business are derived from demand charges  which do not vary with the actual amount of gas transported 
during the periods in which we were constructing power plants we utilized the percentage of completion method to determine what portion of our overall construction fee had been earned 
we utilized the services of third party engineering firms to help us estimate the progress being made on each project  but any such process requires subjective judgments 
any errors in this estimation process could have resulted in revenues being reported before or after they were actually earned 
increases or decreases in revenues resulting from revisions to these estimates were recorded in the period in which the facts that gave rise to the revision became known 
with respect to the amount of income or expense we recognize in association with our pension and retiree medical plans  we must make a number of assumptions with respect to both future financial conditions for example  medical costs  returns on fund assets and market interest rates as well as future actions by plan participants for example  when they will retire and how long they will live after retirement 
most of these assumptions have relatively minor impacts on the overall accounting recognition given to these plans but two assumptions in particular  the discount rate and the assumed long term rate of return on fund assets  can have significant effects on the amount of expense recorded and liability recognized 
at year end  we utilized an expected long term return of on pension and retiree medical fund assets 
this return is predicated on the fact that  historically over long periods of time  widely traded large cap equity securities have provided a return of approximately  while fixed income securities have provided a return of approximately 
at december   our pension fund assets portfolio consisted of approximately equity  debt and cash and cash equivalents  indicating that a long term expected return would be approximately if the investments were made in the broad indexes 
since our pension funds are actively managed by professional managers who provide this service for a fee  we expect to earn a premium of to on the equity portion of our portfolio and to on the fixed income portion  over and above the fees we pay our money managers 
thus  on a weighted basis  we would expect to earn a premium of to due to active management 
our historical premium over a balanced index was  and for the latest year  year and year periods  respectively 
therefore  using the low end of the range for the expected active management premium  we arrive at an overall expected return of  which we have lowered slightly to for purposes of making the pension fund calculations 
the discount rate  which is intended to reflect a current settlement rate and is used to value the liabilities associated with these plans  was reduced from at year end to at year end  reflecting a similar decrease in the yields of high grade corporate bonds which are the benchmark reference for this rate assumption 
while we believe these assumptions are appropriate in the circumstances  other assumptions could also be reasonably applied and  therefore  we note that  at our current level of pension and retiree medical funding  i a change of in the long term return assumption would change our annual pension and retiree medical expense by million and million  respectively  in comparison to that recorded in and ii a change in the discount rate would change our projected pension benefit obligation and our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and million  respectively  compared to those balances as of december  with respect to our environmental exposure  we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts 
these estimates are affected by the choice of remediation methods as well as the expected timing and length of the effort 
often  as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses  additional information is obtained  requiring revisions to estimated costs 
these revisions are reflected in our income in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
we are subject to litigation as the result of our business operations and transactions 
we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from judgments or settlements 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates  our earnings will be affected 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance  any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached 
in addition  we do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed 
therefore  we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate 
changes in our effective rate  including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes  are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified 
as discussed under risk management elsewhere herein  we enter into derivative contracts natural gas futures  swaps and options solely for the purpose of mitigating risks that accompany our normal business activities  including interest rates and the price of natural gas and associated transportation 
we account for these derivative transactions as hedges in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidelines  marking the derivatives to market at each reporting date  with the unrealized gains and losses either recognized as part of comprehensive income or  in the case of interest rate swaps  as a valuation adjustment to the underlying debt 
any inefficiency in the performance of the hedge is recognized in income currently and  ultimately  the financial results of the hedge are recognized concurrently with the financial results of the underlying hedged item 
all but an insignificant amount of our natural gas related derivatives are for terms of months or less  allowing us to utilize widely available  published forward pricing curves in determining all of our appropriate market values 
our interest rate swaps are similar in nature to many other such financial instruments and are valued for us by commercial banks with expertise in such valuations

includes a charge of million to reduce the carrying value of certain power assets as discussed under power and other following 
incidental asset sales are included in business segment earnings

our income from continuing operations increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
this increase is comprised of a decrease of million in operating income  an increase of in net other income and expenses and a decrease of million in income tax expense 
following is a discussion of items affecting operating income and other income and expenses 
please refer to the individual business segment discussions included elsewhere herein for additional information regarding business segment results 
refer to the headings other income and expenses  income taxes continuing operations and discontinued operations included elsewhere herein for additional information regarding these items 
our results for  in comparison to  reflect a decrease of million in operating revenues  a decrease of million in gross margin and a decrease of million in operating income 
the decrease in operating revenues and gross margin was principally attributable to decreased revenues in our power and other segment  partially offset by increased revenues in our natural gas pipeline company of america segment see the individual business segment discussions for additional information 
operating income was negatively impacted in  relative to  by i decreased earnings from our power and other business segment  including a million charge in to revalue certain investments see power and other following  ii a million charge in related to certain long term natural gas purchase contracts see note m of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and iii an increase of million in general and administrative expenses  exclusive of a charge related to enron corp 
see below 
this increase in general and administrative expenses was principally attributable to increased employee benefit costs 
these negative impacts were partially offset by i increased earnings from our natural gas pipeline company of america  transcolorado pipeline and kinder morgan retail business segments and ii the fact that results included a million loss resulting from nonperformance by a derivative counterparty enron corp  see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
below the operating income line  net other income and expenses increased from income of million in to income of million in  an increase of million 
this increase reflected i increased equity in earnings of kinder morgan energy partners in due  in part  to the strong performance from the assets held by kinder morgan energy partners and the cessation of amortization of equity method goodwill related to this investment due to the adoption of sfas no 
see note n of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and ii decreased interest expense reflecting lower interest rates and borrowed balances 
these positive impacts were partially offset by i a million increase in minority interest expense in  principally attributable to the minority interests in kinder morgan management  llc and ii a million decrease in net gains from asset sales in see note p of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
our results for  in comparison to  reflect a decrease of billion in operating revenues  a decrease of million in gross margin and a decrease of million in operating income 
these declines are attributable to the fact that consolidated results for include the results of kinder morgan texas pipeline  lp  referred to in this report as kinder morgan texas pipeline operating revenues  gross margin and operating income before corporate charges of billion  million and million  respectively  which was contributed to kinder morgan energy partners effective december  if the results of kinder morgan texas pipeline are excluded from results  the comparison of results from to reflects increases of million  million and million in operating revenues  gross margin and operating income  respectively 
these increases represent improved results at each of our business segments  with kinder morgan retail making the largest contribution to increased revenues and power and other making the largest contribution to the increases in gross margin and operating income 
general and administrative expenses increased by million from to principally as a result of i increased costs for employee benefits and ii a million loss in resulting from nonperformance by a derivative counterparty as discussed above 
below the operating income line  the improved results for  relative to  were principally due to i an increase of million in equity in the earnings in kinder morgan energy partners in  net of amortization of excess investment and ii a decrease of million in net interest expense 
the favorable variance created by these impacts was partially offset by i million of increased minority interest due to the sale of kinder morgan management shares and ii a reduction of approximately million in net gains from assets sales in for  earnings attributable to our investment in kinder morgan energy partners are expected to increase by approximately due to  among other factors  the improved performance of existing assets 
however  there are factors beyond the control of kinder morgan energy partners that may affect its results  including developments in the regulatory arena and as yet unforeseen competitive developments or acquisitions 
diluted earnings per share increased from in to in  an increase of or reflecting  in addition to the financial and operating impacts discussed preceding  an increase of million in average shares outstanding 
excluding the impact of discontinued operations in and the and impact of extraordinary losses in and  respectively  diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased from in to in  an increase of or 
after adjusting for the revaluation of power assets  the favorable income tax adjustment and other non recurring items aggregating in each respective year  diluted earnings per share increased from in to in  an increase of or 
results of operations we manage our various businesses by  among other things  allocating capital and monitoring operating performance 
this management process includes dividing the company into business segments so that performance can be effectively monitored and reported for a limited number of discrete businesses 
currently  we manage and report our operations in the following business segments business segment business conducted referred to as natural gas pipeline company of america and certain affiliates the ownership and operation of a major interstate natural gas pipeline and storage system natural gas pipeline company of america transcolorado gas transmission company the ownership and operation of an interstate natural gas pipeline system in colorado and new mexico transcolorado pipeline retail natural gas distribution the regulated sale and transportation of natural gas to residential  commercial and industrial customers including a small distribution system currently being built out in hermosillo  mexico and the non regulated sales of natural gas to certain utility customers under the choice gas program kinder morgan retail power generation and other the operation and  in previous periods  construction of natural gas fired electric generation facilities  together with various other activities not constituting separately managed or reportable business segments power and other in previous periods  we owned and operated other lines of business  which we discontinued during our direct investment in the natural gas transmission and storage business decreased significantly as a result of i the december  contribution to kinder morgan energy partners of kinder morgan interstate gas transmission llc and ii the december  contribution to kinder morgan energy partners of kinder morgan texas pipeline 
in each case  the transaction was unanimously approved by our independent directors with the benefit of independent legal advice and a fairness opinion from merrill lynch 
the results of operations of these two businesses are included in our financial statements until their disposition 
in the fourth quarter of  as further discussed under power and other following  we decided to discontinue the development portion of our power generation business and decreased the carrying value of certain of our power assets 
transcolorado gas transmission company was a joint venture with questar corp 
until we became sole owner by purchasing questar corp 
s interest effective october  results of operations for this segment include our share of transcolorado pipeline s earnings recognized under the equity method of accounting prior to october and consolidated results at the level thereafter 
the accounting policies we apply in the generation of business segment information are generally the same as those described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  except that i certain items below the operating income line are either not allocated to business segments or are not considered by management in its evaluation of business segment performance and ii equity in earnings of equity method investees  other than kinder morgan energy partners and certain insignificant international investees  are included in segment results 
these equity method earnings are included in other income and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  i certain items included in operating income such as general and administrative expenses are not allocated to individual business segments and ii gains and losses from incidental sales of assets are included in segment earnings 
with adjustment for these items  we currently evaluate business segment performance primarily based on operating income in relation to the level of capital employed 
we account for intersegment sales at market prices  while we account for asset transfers at either market value or  in some instances  book value 
as necessary for comparative purposes  we have reclassified prior period results and balances to conform to the current presentation 
following are operating results by individual business segment before intersegment eliminations  including explanations of significant variances between the periods presented 
natural gas pipeline company of america year ended december  in thousands except systems throughput operating revenues gross margin segment earnings systems throughput trillion btus natural gas pipeline company of america s segment earnings increased by million  or  from to operating results for were positively affected  relative to  by i increased margins from natural gas transportation and storage services  including operational natural gas sales and ii the inclusion of earnings from our equity investment in horizon pipeline company  which was placed into service during the second quarter of these positive impacts were partially offset by i increased operations and maintenance expenses attributable to transmission mains and underground storage facilities  ii increased depreciation expense due to the addition of new facilities  principally the extension of our system to east st 
louis  illinois  iii increased ad valorem taxes and iv the fact that results include million of pre tax gains from incidental asset sales 
although systems throughput increased in  this increase did not have a significant impact on revenues or segment earnings due to the fact that transportation revenues are derived primarily from demand contracts in which shippers pay a fee to reserve a set amount of system capacity for their use 
natural gas pipeline company of america s segment earnings increased by million  or  from to operating results for were positively affected  relative to  by i increased natural gas transportation and storage margins and ii a million increase in pre tax gains from incidental asset sales in these positive impacts were partially offset by i increased operations and maintenance expenses  primarily attributable to the higher costs of electric power for compression  ii increased ad valorem taxes and iii the fact that results include a million refund of previously expensed transportation charges from an unaffiliated interstate pipeline 
substantially all of natural gas pipeline company of america s pipeline capacity is committed under firm transportation contracts ranging from one to five years 
under these contracts  over of the revenues are derived from a demand charge and  therefore  are collected regardless of the volume of gas actually transported 
the principal impact of the actual level of gas transported is on fuel recoveries  which are received in kind as volumes move on the system 
approximately of the total transportation volume committed under natural gas pipeline company of america s long term firm transportation contracts in effect on january  had remaining terms of less than three years 
contracts representing of natural gas pipeline company of america s total long term contracted firm transport capacity as of january  are scheduled to expire during natural gas pipeline company of america continues to actively pursue the renegotiation  extension and or replacement of expiring contracts 
as of february   of natural gas pipeline company of america s long term contracted firm transport capacity as of january  that was scheduled to expire during had been recontracted or terms had been agreed to for rollover with the same customers  and certain other of that capacity had been sold to other customers 
nicor gas and peoples energy  two local gas distribution companies in the chicago  illinois area  are natural gas pipeline company of america s two largest customers 
for  we currently expect that natural gas pipeline company of america will experience growth in segment earnings in comparison to this increase in earnings is expected to be derived primarily from i the impact of having a full year of earnings from the horizon pipeline and the east st 
louis expansion project  ii incremental earnings from the north lansing storage expansion project  expected to be in service in the spring of and iii new electric power generation load 
however  as discussed following  there are factors beyond our control that can affect our results  including developments in the regulatory arena and as yet unforeseen competitive developments 
accordingly  our actual future results may differ significantly from our projections 
our principal exposure to market variability is related to the variation in natural gas prices and basis differentials  which can affect gross margins in our natural gas pipeline company of america segment 
basis differential is a term that refers to the difference in natural gas prices between two locations or two points in time 
these price differences can be affected by  among other things  natural gas supply and demand  available transportation capacity  storage inventories and deliverability  prices of alternative fuels and weather conditions 
in recent periods  additional competitive pressures have been generated in midwest natural gas markets due to the introduction and planned introduction of pipeline capacity to bring additional supplies of natural gas into the chicago market area  although incremental pipeline capacity to take gas out of the area has also been constructed 
we have attempted to reduce our exposure to this form of market variability by pursuing long term  fixed rate type contract agreements to utilize the capacity on natural gas pipeline company of america s system 
in addition  as discussed under risk management elsewhere in this document and in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  we utilize a comprehensive risk management program to mitigate our exposure to changes in the market price of natural gas and associated transportation 
the majority of natural gas pipeline company of america s system is subject to rate regulation under the jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission 
currently  there are no material proceedings challenging the rates on any of our pipeline systems 
nonetheless  shippers on our pipelines do have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations 
there can be no assurance that we will not face future challenges to the rates we receive for services on our pipeline systems 
transcolorado pipeline year ended december  in thousands except systems throughput operating revenues gross margin segment earnings losses systems throughput trillion btus transcolorado pipeline was a joint venture with questar corp 
until we bought questar s interest effective october   thus becoming the sole owner 
as a result  transcolorado pipeline s results shown above reflect our equity interest in its earnings prior to october  and of its results on a consolidated basis thereafter 
the significant improvements in transcolorado pipeline s operating results from to and from to  apart from the change in our ownership  result from the increased demand and associated increased throughput on the system 
this increased demand has resulted from the incremental natural gas production available in the rocky mountain basins that form the principal supply area for transcolorado pipeline and the limited pathways for this natural gas to get to markets both east and west of these production areas 
as a result of this increased demand and associated increased basis differentials  transcolorado pipeline has sold out its firm available capacity through october on january   we announced the start of an open season seeking shipper interest and commitments for a proposal to expand capacity on the transcolorado system 
this expansion project would include additional compression and line looping infrastructure to increase capacity on the existing transcolorado mainline  which currently has capacity of approximately  dekatherms per day  by as much as  dekatherms per day 
as part of this open season  we are also seeking shipper support for an extension of the transcolorado system with a capacity of  dekatherms per day 
as designed  this inch diameter pipeline would extend from transcolorado pipeline s existing southern terminus in the blanco hub area to a point near window rock in apache county  arizona  where it would connect to kinder morgan energy partners proposed silver canyon pipeline 
this proposed extension would also feature new interconnects with el paso natural gas company and transwestern pipeline company 
whether or not either or both expansions are actually built will depend on a number of factors  including shipper support 
we will not build either project in the absence of firm contracts to support the capital expenditures 
for  we currently expect that transcolorado pipeline will experience growth in segment earnings in comparison to this earnings increase is expected to be driven by a full year of ownership and increased demand for capacity on the transcolorado system and basis differentials for the year which will exceed those experienced in for the reasons discussed above 
however  these market factors are largely beyond our control and  as discussed following  transcolorado pipeline is subject to federal regulation 
accordingly  its actual future results may differ significantly from our projections 
the majority of transcolorado s system is subject to rate regulation under the jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission 
currently  there are no material proceedings challenging the rates on any of our pipeline systems 
nonetheless  shippers on our pipelines do have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances prescribed by applicable regulations 
there can be no assurance that we will not face challenges to the rates we receive for services on our pipeline systems in the future 
transcolorado pipeline is also subject to market variability in natural gas prices and basis differentials 
please refer to the discussion of basis differentials under the heading natural gas pipeline company of america in this item 
kinder morgan retail year ended december  in thousands except systems throughput operating revenues gross margin segment earnings systems throughput trillion btus kinder morgan retail s segment earnings increased by million  or  from to these operating results were positively impacted in  relative to  by i margins derived from the fourth quarter acquisition of natural gas distribution facilities from citizens communications company  as described following  ii strong demand during irrigation season  iii the addition of new customers in existing service territories and iv a million ad valorem tax refund in from an affiliated shipper 
the decrease in operating revenues was principally due to lower natural gas prices a component of the overall sales rate in than in and was offset by lower costs for natural gas purchases 
the increase in gross margins was partially offset by higher operations  maintenance and depreciation expenses in principally attributable to the newly acquired facilities 
kinder morgan retail s segment earnings increased by million  or  from to these operating results were positively impacted in  relative to  by i continued successful risk management of gas supply needs  which has reduced  but not eliminated  weather related volatility in earnings refer to the heading risk management in this item for a more detailed discussion of our risk management strategy  ii improved results from our retail gas distribution properties in mexico and iii the inclusion  in results  of income from the wolf creek storage system 
these positive impacts were partially offset by higher operating expenses in resulting from overall system expansion 
the increase in operating revenues in was principally due to higher natural gas prices in than in and was offset by higher costs for natural gas purchases 
during the fourth quarter of  kinder morgan retail successfully completed the acquisition of natural gas distribution facilities from citizens communications company for approximately million in cash and assumed liabilities 
the natural gas distribution assets serve approximately  residential  commercial and agricultural customers in bent  crowley  otero  archuleta  la plata and mineral counties in colorado 
for  we currently expect that kinder morgan retail will experience approximately growth in segment earnings 
with a stable base of earnings due to regulated business  supplemented by a weather hedging program  increased earnings are expected to derive largely from the addition of new customers in existing service territories  especially certain high growth areas in colorado 
however  as discussed following  there are factors beyond our control that can affect our results  including developments in the regulatory arena  currently unforeseen competitive developments and weather related impacts outside our hedging program 
accordingly  our actual future results may differ significantly from our projections 
a significant portion of kinder morgan retail s business is subject to rate regulation by various state and local jurisdictions in colorado  wyoming and nebraska 
there are currently no material proceedings challenging the base rates on any of our intrastate pipeline or distribution systems 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that we will not face future challenges to the rates we receive for these services 
kinder morgan retail is also subject to market variability in natural gas prices and basis differentials 
please refer to the discussion of basis differentials under the heading natural gas pipeline company of america in this item

concurrently with commencement of commercial operations  i kinder morgan power company  our wholly owned subsidiary  made a preferred investment in triton power company llc valued at approximately million  ii triton power company llc  through its wholly owned affiliate  triton power michigan llc  entered into a year lease of the jackson power facility from the plant owner  alphagen power  llc  and iii we received full payment of our million construction note receivable 
our preferred equity interest has no management or voting rights  but does retain certain protective rights  and is entitled to a cumulative return  compounded monthly  of per annum 
no income is expected in from this preferred investment 
we account for this investment under the cost method  under which earnings are recognized as cash is received 
also effective july   construction and testing of the megawatt wrightsville  arkansas power generation facility were completed and commercial operations commenced 
mirant corporation operates and maintains the wrightsville power facility and manages the natural gas supply and electricity sales for the project company that owns the power plant 
kinder morgan power company made and retains a preferred investment in the project company 
no income is expected in from this investment 
in addition  kinder morgan power company advanced approximately million to the electricity transmission carrier and the project company  which is scheduled to be repaid with interest over the next several years 
our preferred equity interest has no management or voting rights  but does retain certain protective rights  and provides for a cumulative preferred dividend return that escalates over time from to 
we account for this investment under the cost method  under which earnings are recognized as cash is received 
during  we noted that a number of factors had negatively affected power s business environment and certain of its current operations 
these factors  which are currently expected to continue in the near to intermediate term  include i volatile and generally declining prices for wholesale electric power in certain markets  ii cancellation and or postponement of the construction of a number of new power generation facilities  iii difficulty in obtaining air permits with acceptable operating conditions and constraints and iv a marked deterioration in the financial condition of a number of participants in the power generating and marketing business  including participants in the two newly constructed power plants in jackson  michigan and wrightsville  arkansas 
during the fourth quarter of  after completing an analysis of these and other factors to determine their impact on the market value of these assets and the prospects for this business in the future  we i determined that we would no longer pursue power development activities and ii recorded a million pre tax charge million after tax  or per diluted common share to reduce the carrying value of our investments in i sites for future power plant development  ii power plants and iii turbines and associated equipment see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
in recent months  the cash flows generated by the wrightsville project company have not been adequate to service the associated debt 
if this continues  it could have an adverse effect on our remaining investment  although the carrying value we have recorded is supported by recent valuations made by potential third party purchasers 
due to the fact that we are not projecting any further power plant development projects  we currently expect that segment earnings from our power segment in will decline by approximately 
actual future results may differ significantly from our projections 
pursuant to a right we obtained in conjunction with the acquisition of the thermo companies  prior to the end of  we expect to make an additional investment in our colorado power businesses in the form of approximately million kinder morgan energy partners common units that we currently own or acquire 
we expect to deliver these units to an entity controlled by the former thermo owners  which entity will be required to retain these units for a period ending in  during which period we will be entitled to receive distributions made by kinder morgan energy partners attributable to those units 
the effect of this incremental investment will be to increase our ownership in the thermo entities beginning in kinder morgan texas pipeline we transferred kinder morgan texas pipeline to kinder morgan energy partners in december see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding this transaction

this increase was principally due to i increased equity in the earnings of kinder morgan energy partners due  in part  to the strong performance from the assets held by kinder morgan energy partners and the cessation of amortization of equity method goodwill related to this investment due to the adoption of sfas no 
see note n of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  ii decreased interest expense  reflecting reduced interest rates and reduced debt outstanding and iii increased earnings from other equity investments  principally transcolorado pipeline 
these positive impacts were partially offset by i a million increase in minority interest expense in  principally attributable to the minority interests in kinder morgan management  llc and ii a million decrease in gains from sales of assets 
other income and expenses was a net decrease to earnings of million in and a net increase to earnings of million in this positive change of million was principally due to i an increase of million in equity in earnings of kinder morgan energy partners  net of associated amortization  ii a decrease of million in net interest expense in  reflecting reduced interest rates and reduced debt outstanding and iii a reduction of million from equity in losses of transcolorado pipeline 
these favorable impacts were partially offset by i a decrease of million in net gains from sales of assets  ii an increase of million in expense due to minority interest in  principally due to the issuance of kinder morgan management shares and iii the fact that results include a million due to the recovery of note receivable proceeds in excess of its carrying value and b million due to the settlement of a regulatory matter for an amount less than that previously reserved 
income taxes continuing operations the income tax provision decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million despite an increase of million in income from continuing operations before income taxes 
the income tax provision for was reduced by the combined impacts of i a decrease in the effective tax rate on current year income from approximately in to approximately in  principally due to a decrease in the provision for state income taxes  ii a decrease of approximately million due to the impact of the lower effective tax rate on previously recorded deferred tax liabilities  iii a decrease of approximately million due to the resolution of certain issues with respect to prior year tax returns at amounts less than those previously accrued and iv a decrease of approximately million due to the impact of a dividends received deduction 
the increase of million in the income tax provision from to is almost solely due to increased pre tax income 
the apparent increase in the effective tax rate in is due to the fact that the minority interest in the earnings of kinder morgan management is presented net of its associated tax expense 
discontinued operations during  we adopted and implemented plans to discontinue the following lines of business i gathering and processing of natural gas  including short haul intrastate pipelines and providing field services to natural gas producers  ii wholesale marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids  iii international operations and iv the direct marketing of non energy products and services 
during  we completed the disposition of these businesses  with the exception of international operations principally consisting of a natural gas distribution system under construction in hermosillo  mexico  which  in the fourth quarter of  we decided to retain

cash flows the following discussion of cash flows should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and related supplemental disclosures 
all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
net cash flows from operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
this positive variance principally reflects a million increase in cash distributions received in attributable to our interest in kinder morgan energy partners and a decrease of million in cash outflows for gas in underground storage during significant year to year variations in cash used or generated from gas in storage transactions are due to changes in injection and withdrawal volumes as well as fluctuations in natural gas prices 
these positive impacts were partially offset by several non recurring cash payments and cash flow timing issues including i a second quarter million payment and escrow deposit in settlement of certain litigation involving jack j 
grynberg  ii a million pension contribution in of which million was in excess of book expense  iii a decrease of million in cash associated with other working capital items  primarily attributable to interest and taxes receivable and iv a decrease of million in cash attributable to deferred purchased gas costs 
the million pension contribution made in april was deductible under internal revenue service regulations but was not required to be made under erisa minimum contribution guidelines 
net cash flows provided by operating activities increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase is primarily due to i a decrease of million in cash flows used for discontinued operations  primarily attributable to the termination of our receivables sales program see short term liquidity and financing transactions following  ii a million increase in cash distributions received in attributable to our interest in kinder morgan energy partners and iii a million increase in cash inflow in due to decreased deferred purchase gas costs resulting from lower natural gas prices 
in general  distributions from kinder morgan energy partners are declared in the month following the end of the quarter to which they apply and are paid in the month following the month of declaration to the general partner and unit holders of record as of the end of the month of declaration

litigation and environmental our anticipated environmental capital costs and expenses for  including expected costs for remediation efforts  are approximately million  compared to approximately million of such costs and expenses incurred in a substantial portion of our environmental costs are either recoverable through insurance and indemnification provisions or have previously recorded liabilities associated with them 
we had an established environmental reserve of approximately million at december   to address remediation issues associated with approximately projects 
this reserve is primarily established to address and clean up soil and ground water impacts from former releases to the environment at facilities we have acquired 
reserves for each project are generally established by reviewing existing documents  conducting interviews and performing site inspections to determine the overall size and impact to the environment 
reviews are made on a quarterly basis to determine the status of the cleanup and the costs associated with the effort and to identify if the reserve allocation is appropriately valued 
in assessing environmental risks in conjunction with proposed acquisitions  we review records relating to environmental issues  conduct site inspections  interview employees  and  if appropriate  collect soil and groundwater samples 
after consideration of reserves established  we believe that costs for environmental remediation and ongoing compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial position or results of operations or diminish our ability to operate our businesses 
however  there can be no assurances that future events  such as changes in existing laws  the promulgation of new laws  or the development or discovery of new or existing facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant unanticipated costs

pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests within years of the date of enactment and must perform subsequent integrity tests on a seven year cycle 
at least percent of the highest risk segments must be tested within five years of the enactment date 
the risk ratings are based on numerous factors  including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline  as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating 
testing will consist of hydrostatic testing  internal electronic testing  or direct assessment of the piping 
in addition  within one year of the law s enactment  pipeline companies must implement a qualification program to make certain that employees are properly trained  using criteria the us department of transportation is responsible for providing 
natural gas pipeline company of america estimates that the average annual incremental expenditure associated with the pipeline safety improvement act of will be approximately million to million dollars 
see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding regulatory matters 
risk management the following discussion should be read in conjunction with note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information on our risk management activities 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  collectively  statement statement established accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative financial instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if the derivatives meet those criteria  statement allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company formally designate a derivative as a hedge and document and assess the effectiveness of derivatives associated with transactions that receive hedge accounting 
we enter into derivative contracts solely for the purpose of hedging exposures that accompany our normal business activities 
as a result of the adoption of statement  the fair value of our derivative financial instruments utilized for hedging activities as of january  a loss of million was reported as accumulated other comprehensive income 
in accordance with the provisions of statement  we designated these instruments as hedges of various exposures as discussed following  and we test the effectiveness of changes in the value of these hedging instruments with the risk being hedged 
hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in income in the period in which it occurs 
we enter into these transactions only with counterparties whose debt securities are rated investment grade by the major rating agencies 
in general  the risk of default by these counterparties is low 
during the fourth quarter of  however  we determined that enron corp 
was no longer likely to honor the obligations it had to us in conjunction with derivatives we were accounting for as hedges under statement upon making that determination  we i ceased to account for those derivatives as hedges  ii entered into new derivative transactions with other counterparties to replace our position with enron  iii designated the replacement derivative positions as hedges of the exposures that had been hedged with the enron positions and iv recognized a million pre tax loss included with general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for in recognition of the fact that it was unlikely that we would be paid the amounts then owed under the contracts with enron 
while we enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that additional losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
our businesses require that we purchase  sell and consume natural gas 
specifically  we purchase  sell and or consume natural gas i to serve our regulated natural gas distribution sales customers  ii to serve certain of our retail natural gas distribution customers in areas where regulatory restructuring has provided for competition in natural gas supply  for customers who have selected the company as their supplier of choice under our choice gas program  iii as fuel in certain of our colorado power generation facilities  iv as fuel for compressors located on natural gas pipeline company of america s pipeline system and v for operational sales of gas by natural gas pipeline company of america 
with respect to item i  we have no commodity risk because the regulated retail gas distribution regulatory structure provides that actual gas cost is passed through to our customers 
with respect to item iii  only one of these power generation facilities is not covered by a long term  fixed price gas supply agreement at a level sufficient for the current and projected capacity utilization 
with respect to item iv  this fuel is supplied by in kind fuel recoveries that are part of the transportation tariff 
items ii  v and the one power facility included under item iii that is not covered by a long term fixed price natural gas supply agreement  give rise to natural gas commodity price risk which we have chosen to substantially mitigate through our risk management program 
we provide this mitigation through the use of financial derivative products  and we do not utilize these derivatives for any purpose other than risk mitigation 
under our choice gas program  customers in certain areas served by kinder morgan retail are allowed to choose their natural gas supplier from a list of qualified suppliers  although the transportation of the natural gas to the homes and businesses continues to be provided by kinder morgan retail in all cases 
when those customers choose kinder morgan retail as their choice gas supplier  we enter into agreements providing for sales of gas to these customers during a one year period at fixed prices per unit  but variable volumes 
we mitigate the risk associated with these anticipated sales of gas by purchasing natural gas futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange nymex and  as applicable  over the counter basis swaps to mitigate the risk associated with the difference in price changes between henry hub nymex basis and the expected physical delivery location 
in addition  we mitigate a portion of the volumetric risk through the purchase of over the counter natural gas options 
the time period covered by this risk management strategy does not extend beyond one year 
with respect to the power generation facility described above that is not covered by an adequately sized  fixed price gas supply contract  we are exposed to changes in the price of natural gas as we purchase it to use as fuel for the electricity generating turbines 
in order to mitigate this exposure  we purchase natural gas futures on the nymex and  as discussed above  over the counter basis swaps on the nymex  in amounts representing our expected fuel usage in the near term 
in general  we do not hedge this exposure for periods longer than one year 
with respect to operational sales of natural gas made by natural gas pipeline company of america  we are exposed to risk associated with changes in the price of natural gas during the periods in which these sales are made 
we mitigate this risk by selling natural gas futures and  as discussed above  over the counter basis swaps  on the nymex in the periods in which we expect to make these sales 
in general  we do not hedge this exposure for periods in excess of months 
we use a value at risk model to measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas and natural gas liquids markets 
value at risk is a statistical measure of how much the marked to market value of a portfolio could change during a period of time  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we use a closed form model to evaluate risk on a daily basis 
our value at risk computations use a confidence level of percent for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a percent probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk amount presented 
instruments evaluated by the model include forward physical gas  storage and transportation contracts and financial products including commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options 
during  value at risk reached a high of million and a low of million 
value at risk at december   was million and  based on quarter end values  averaged million for our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivatives assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
in addition  as discussed preceding  we enter into these derivatives solely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany our normal business activities and  therefore  the change in the market value of our portfolio of derivatives is  with the exception of a minor amount of hedging inefficiency  offset by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 
during and  all of our natural gas derivative activities were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges 
we recognized approximately  and  of pre tax loss during and  respectively  as a result of ineffectiveness of these hedges  which amounts are reported within the caption gas purchases and other costs of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for and there was no component of these derivative instruments gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
as the hedged sales and purchases take place and we record them into earnings  we will also reclassify the gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings 
we expect to reclassify into earnings  during  substantially all of the million balance in accumulated other comprehensive income representing unrecognized net losses on derivative activities at december  during  no gains or losses were reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges due to a determination that the forecasted transactions would no longer occur by the end of the originally specified time period 
we also provide certain administrative risk management services to kinder morgan energy partners  although kinder morgan energy partners retains the obligations and rights arising from all derivative transactions entered into on its behalf 
our business activities expose us to credit risk with respect to collection of accounts receivable 
in order to mitigate that risk  we routinely monitor the credit status of our existing and potential customers 
when customers credit ratings do not meet our requirements for the extension of unsupported credit  we obtain cash prepayments or letters of credit 
note g of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements provides information on the amount of prepayments we have received 
in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure  it is our policy to borrow funds utilizing a mixture of fixed interest rate and floating interest rate debt 
in august  in order to move closer to a mix of fixed  floating  we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal amount of billion 
in september  we entered into similar fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal amount of million 
these agreements effectively converted the interest expense associated with our senior notes due in  our debentures due in and our senior notes due in from fixed rates to floating rates based on three month libor plus a credit spread 
these swaps have been designated as fair value hedges as defined by statement these swaps meet the conditions required to assume no ineffectiveness under statement and  therefore  we have accounted for them utilizing the shortcut method prescribed for fair value hedges 
accordingly  the carrying value of the swap is adjusted to its fair value as of each reporting period  with an offsetting entry to adjust the carrying value of the debt whose fair value is being hedged 
we record interest expense equal to the floating rate payments  which is accrued monthly and paid semi annually 
based on the long term debt effectively converted to floating rate debt as a result of the swap discussed above  at december   the market risk related to a one percent change in interest rates would result in a million annual impact on pre tax income 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the provisions of this statement related to the rescission of fasb statement no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after may   the provisions related to fasb statement no 
are effective for transactions occurring after may   and all other provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued on or after may  the principal effect of this statement on our reporting is that  beginning with reporting for  previously recorded extraordinary losses on early retirement of debt  as well as any such future losses  will not be classified as extraordinary items but will  instead  be reported as part of income from continuing operations and separately described  if material 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities some  but not all  of which have been referred to as special purpose entities with certain defined characteristics 
one provision of the interpretation increases the minimum amount of third party investment required to support non consolidation from to 
certain of the disclosure provisions contained in the interpretation are effective for financial statements issued after january   all of the provisions are immediately applicable to variable interest entities created after january  and public entities with variable interests in entities created before february  are required to apply the provisions other than the transition disclosure provisions to that entity no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  the principal impact of this interpretation on us is that  upon implementation of this interpretation  we expect to begin consolidation of triton power company llc  the lessee of the jackson  michigan power generation facility 
we operate and have a preferred interest in this entity in which the common interest is owned by others 
triton power company llc has no debt but  as a result of this consolidation  we will include the lease obligation on the jackson plant in our consolidated financial statements 
we expect to apply the provisions of the statement beginning with the third quarter of and  at that time  the total remaining lease payments under the operating lease will be million and will be million  million  million  million and million for through  respectively 
because the lease is an operating lease  it will not be recorded as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
the difference between the earnings impact under consolidation and under the currently applied cost method is not expected to be material 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
this statement contains disclosure requirements that provide descriptions of asset retirement obligations and reconciliations of changes in the components of those obligations 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  earlier applications are encouraged 
we have a number of assets with associated retirement obligations that are subject to the provisions of this statement 
with respect to the natural gas pipeline company of america system  we have certain surface facilities that are required to be dismantled and removed  with certain site reclamation to be performed 
while  in general  our right of way agreements do not require us to remove pipe or otherwise perform remediation upon taking the pipeline permanently out of service  some right of way agreements do provide for these actions 
with respect to our retail natural gas distribution operations  we generally are not obligated to remove our equipment or otherwise perform remediation related to our utility assets 
we do have an obligation to perform removal and remediation activities associated with certain wells utilized in conjunction with our storage facilities 
with respect to our power activities  we generally are not obligated to perform removal or remediation activities associated with our owned power generation facilities and any such obligations associated with the power generation facilities we do not own are the responsibility of others 
we expect that we will be unable to reasonably estimate and record liabilities for the majority of our obligations that fall under the provisions of this statement because we cannot reasonably estimate when such obligations will be settled 
our first quarter financial statements will reflect an obligation for those asset retirement obligations that can be reasonably estimated 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation of fasb statements no

this interpretation incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superceded 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods after december  the interpretive guidance incorporated from interpretation no 
continues to be required for financial statements for fiscal years ending after june  for more information  see heading titled liquidity and capital resources preceding and note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no

under eitf no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no
