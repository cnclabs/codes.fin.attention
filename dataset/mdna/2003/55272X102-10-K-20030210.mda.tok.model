the company s investment strategy also provides for the acquisition of multi family housing properties  investments in reit securities and other securities 
the company s principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to its stockholders  resulting from the spread between the interest and other income it earns on its investments and the cost of financing such investments 
the company has elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
pursuant to the current federal tax regulations  one of the requirements of maintaining its status as a reit is that the company must distribute at least of its annual taxable net income to its stockholders  subject to certain adjustments 
the company was incorporated in maryland on july  and began operations on april  upon consummating the merger 
as a result of the merger  prep fund and prep fund were merged directly into the company and pension fund became a partnership subsidiary of the company 
in december  pension fund was liquidated and dissolved and  as a result  the company acquired of the assets of pension fund 
the remaining assets  consisting solely of cash  were distributed to the holders of pension fund securities who elected to remain in place following the merger 
as a result of the merger  the company issued a total of  shares of its common stock to the former partners of the prep funds 
following the completion of the merger through december   the company was externally advised and managed by the advisor 
as such  the company had no employees and relied entirely on the advisor to perform all of the duties that are typically performed by internal management  as well as perform all back office operations 
pursuant the advisory agreement  the advisor provided the day to day management and administrative functions for the company for a fee  which was calculated on a quarterly basis 
the advisor was a subsidiary of afc 
on december   the company s stockholders approved the terms of the advisor merger agreement  dated september   among the company  the advisor  afc and the stockholders of the advisor which provided for the advisor merger 
the advisor merger became effective on january  as a result of the advisor merger  the company became a self advised reit and  as such  was no longer be required to pay a fee to the advisor under the advisory agreement  but rather directly incur all of the costs of operating the company 
in connection with the advisor merger  the employees of the advisor became employees of the company 
the company also acquired all of the tangible and intangible business assets of the advisor 
on august   the company changed its name from america first mortgage investments  inc to mfa mortgage investments  inc 
the company s core business strategy is to invest on a leveraged basis in a portfolio of high grade arm mbs  which primarily consist of agency mbs 
beginning in september  the company began to significantly increase its asset base by leveraging equity raised through additional public offerings of the company s common stock 
as a result  the company has experienced significant growth in assets and earnings 
the company s total assets grew to billion at december   from billion at december  as of december   of the company s assets consisted of agency mbs  aaa rated mbs and cash 
the company also has indirect interests in four apartment properties and a controlling indirect interest in two apartment properties  these six properties contain a total of  rental units 
four of these apartment properties are located in georgia  one is located in north carolina and one is located in nebraska 
the results of the company s operations are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
the results of the company s operations primarily depend on  among other things  the level of its net interest income  the market value of its assets and the supply of and demand for such assets 
the company s net interest income  which reflects the amortization of purchase premiums  varies primarily as a result of changes in short term interest rates  borrowing costs and prepayment rates  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
prepayment rates  as reflected by the cpr  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
the cpr on the company s mbs portfolio averaged and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition to these factors  borrowing costs are further affected by the creditworthiness of the borrower 
since changes in interest rates may significantly affect the company s activities  the operating results of the company depend  in large part  upon the ability of the company to effectively manage its interest rate and prepayment risks while maintaining its status as a reit 
during  the company sold all of its remaining investments in corporate debt securities  realizing an aggregate net loss of  the company also has risks inherent in its other investments  comprised of interests in multi family real estate properties and hedging instruments 
because these investments represented less than of the company s total assets at december   the risk related to these assets is limited  nonetheless  these investments have the potential of causing a material impact on the company s operating performance in future periods 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  in comparing the results of operations for with  the results of each year are marked by significant charges and or gains as well as substantial growth in assets funded by investment and leveraging of the additional equity capital raised during the year 
during and  the company recognized charges of million and million  respectively  against certain of its debt securities due to other than temporary declines in their market values 
other non recurring items for included a gain of million on the sale of an assisted living center and the million one time expense incurred in connection with the advisor merger  of which million was non cash  stock based consideration 
further  prior to  the company s operating expenses were primarily comprised of a formula driven fee paid to the advisor  subsequent to the advisor merger  which became effective january   the company incurred its own direct operating costs 
the board of directors sets the company s dividend rates based on  among other things  the company s taxable income 
the capital losses realized on the sale of the company s investments in corporate debt securities during and cannot be used to offset operating income 
the tax losses will be carried forward and used to offset future long term capital gains  if any 
the gain realized on the sale of the assisted living center during was deferred for tax purposes and therefore did not impact the company s taxable income 
total interest and dividend income earned in increased by million  or  to million compared to million earned in during  the average amortized cost basis of the mbs portfolio increased by billion to billion from million for the growth in the portfolio during is attributable to the investment of proceeds  on a leveraged basis  of million from the sale of million shares of the company s common stock 
the mbs portfolio generated income  after premium amortization  of million in  an increase of million  or  from million for the overall increase in income related to the growth in mbs investments was partially offset by a decrease in the net yield on the mbs portfolio to for from for  reflecting the impact of the decline in market interest rates that continued during further  the increase in prepayments caused additional amounts to be reinvested at lower prevailing market interest rates and an acceleration of the premium amortization on the portfolio 
the cpr  which is a measure of the prepayment speed  increased to a weighted average of for from for during  the company recorded premium amortization of million  which reduced the net yield on the mbs portfolio by basis points for  while net premium amortization for was million  which reduced the yield on the portfolio by basis points 
management carefully monitors the premiums paid for mbs to mitigate the impact of spikes in prepayment activity  such as those experienced during as of december   the company had net purchase premiums of million  reflecting an aggregate portfolio premium of to par value  compared to million of premiums  or of par value  at december  lifetime and interim interest rate caps on arm mbs could limit the change in the coupon on such assets 
at december   million  or of the company s arm mbs of the company s total assets had a interim cap with the remainder having a interim cap 
income recognized on short term investments in cash and cash equivalents increased by  or  to  for from  in while the yield on the company s cash decreased to for  from for  the average balance of cash and cash equivalents increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for in general  as the portfolio of mbs continues to grow  balances of cash and cash equivalents also tend to increase  reflecting the reinvestment lag on larger monthly scheduled amortization and pre payments received on the mbs portfolio 
further  as reflected by the increase in the cpr  greater prepayments increased cash inflows  increasing the company s temporary investments in money market accounts until ultimately reinvested in mbs 
income from corporate debt and equity securities decreased by an aggregate of million in  or  resulting from the sale of the entire corporate debt and equity portfolio during the company s interest expense increased by million  or  for  compared to this increase is related to the significant increase in average borrowings under repurchase agreements 
the company s increase in borrowings through repurchase agreements reflects the leveraging of million of equity capital raised during the average balance of repurchase agreements increased to billion for  compared to million for  while the cost of such borrowings decreased to for  from for net interest income increased by million  or  to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s net interest margin narrowed slightly to for  from for the interest rate spread also decreased slightly to for  compared to for this slight decrease reflects the decrease in the yield on interest earning assets to for  from for and the decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities to for  from for during  interest rates continued to generally decline from management believes that it is unlikely that interest rates will continue to decline significantly in total other income decreased by million to a loss of million in  from income of  for the components of the net total other income loss include i income from equity interests in real estate  ii income from operations of real estate held  which was comprised of the consolidated income of rcc for the fourth quarter of  iii net gain loss on the sale of securities and iv other than temporary impairment charges taken against investments in corporate debt securities during both and prior to october   the company accounted for its non controlling interest in the preferred stock of rcc under the equity method  whereby results of operations were reported net  relative the company s equity interest 
on october   the company acquired of the voting common stock in rcc  and commenced accounting for such subsidiary on a consolidated basis  prospectively 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item this change in ownership and resulting change in accounting for rcc caused certain line items of the company s statement of operations to be non comparable to the presentation 
while income from equity interests in real estate was  for  compared to million for  had rcc continued to be accounted for under the equity method for in its entirety  the company would have reported income from equity interests in real estate of  for  compared to million for  primarily reflecting the impact of a million non recurring gain on the sale of an assisted living center realized during excluding the gain  income from equity interest in real estate investments would have decreased by  for compared to  had the company continued to account for rcc under the equity method for in its entirety 
as of december   the company had indirect interests in six multi family properties consisting of a total of  rental units  through investments in four limited partnerships and one corporation as a common stockholder 
in the aggregate  real estate equity interests and real estate held  which is owned through a consolidated subsidiary  comprised less than of the company s total assets at december  the company reported a net gain of  on the sale of securities during  comprised of gross gains of million and gross losses of million

the corporate debt securities portfolio accounted for an aggregate net losses of million during  which includes the million impairment charge and net gains and losses from sales  which decreased earnings by 
per basic and diluted share 
the company liquidated all of the corporate debt and equity portfolios during  and has no future plans to resume investing in such instruments 
during  the company recognized gross losses of million  on its investments in corporate debt securities  of which million was attributable to the rcn corporation rcn debt securities 
losses recognized on the rcn securities during were comprised of i a million impairment charge made against the investment for an other than temporary decline in the market value and ii losses of  realized on sales and redemptions 
operating and other expenses for the year ended december  are not readily comparable to operating costs incurred during during  the company was externally managed  and as such had no employees or the typical costs associated with being internally managed 
prior to january   the company s general and administrative expenses were primarily comprised of formula driven fees payable to the advisor 
during  the company incurred cost of million to acquire the advisor  of which million was non cash  comprised of  shares of the company s common stock 
the company and the advisor merged effective am on january  as a result  the company became self advised commencing january  and  has thereafter directly incurred the cost of all overhead necessary to operate the company

during  the company incurred million of operating expenses  or of average assets on an annualized basis  of which  employee compensation and benefits were million  or  operating expenses from real estate held and mortgage interest for the fourth quarter were  and  respectively  or  and other general and administrative expenses were million  or 
other general and administrative expenses were comprised primarily of fees for professional services  including legal and accounting  corporate insurance  office rent and director fees 
the company relocated to new headquarters during the third quarter of  as additional space was needed to accommodate the company s post advisor merger operations 
in addition  commencing october   when the company acquired the voting common stock of rcc  the company consolidated rcc s results of operations  resulting in rcc s indirect mortgages and related interest expense being reported on the company s consolidated financial statements 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item these mortgage loans  which had an aggregate balance of million  had an average interest rate of 
prior to the company acquiring the voting common stock of rcc  the preferred stock interest in rcc was accounted for under the equity method  with the company s percentage interest in rcc s income or loss reflected net as a component of income from equity interests in real estate 
during  the sarbanes oxley act sox act was enacted 
the sox act  among other things  places additional responsibilities on management and the boards of directors of public companies 
the company expects to incur incremental costs associated with complying with the provisions of the sox act and other related changes to federal securities and corporate governance laws 
the company expects to experience an increase in the cost of its professional fees  including  but not limited to  accounting and compliance 
the incremental increase in costs to be incurred to comply with the provisions of the sox act and related changes to federal securities and corporate governance laws  as well as other associated increases  such as director and officer liability insurance  is uncertain at the present time 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  in comparing the results of operations for with  the results are marked by two significant charges and a substantial growth in assets funded by leveraging of the additional equity capital raised during the year 
during  the company incurred a one time expense of million  of which million was non cash  in connection with the advisor merger 
in addition  the company incurred a charge of million taken against the corporate debt securities portfolio for an other than temporary impairment against an investment in corporate debt securities 
total interest and dividend income increased by million  or  to million compared to million earned in the increase is directly attributable to the growth in assets as a result of the investing  on a leveraged basis  the proceeds from the sale of million shares of the company s common stock 
the company s core assets which consist of mbs  generated million of income  reflecting million  or  increase from million for the increase in mbs income reflects the growth in the company s mbs portfolio of billion  or  from million as of december  to billion as of december  lifetime interest rate caps on arm mbs could limit earnings on the company s assets 
at december   of the company s arm mbs had a interim cap with the remainder having a interim cap 
income recognized on short term investments in cash and cash equivalents increased by  as funds generated through the sale of the company s common shares remain in interest earning cash investments until fully invested 
further  significant growth in investments will  in general  due to the reinvestment lag  result in an increase in temporary cash investments 
income from corporate debt securities increased  however losses on sales of such securities and losses recognized for other than temporary impairment on one of the company s corporate debt investments far exceeded the growth in income 
slightly offsetting increases in interest income was a decrease in dividend income on equity securities of  reflecting sales of equity securities 
the yield on the equity security portfolio decreased to for from in the company s interest expense increased by million  or  for the year ended december  the average borrowings under repurchase agreements increased by million  or from million during to million during  while the average cost of borrowings decreased from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net interest and dividend income increased by million  or  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s net interest margin improved by basis points to for from for overall  the significant increase in the company s net interest income can be attributed to the significant balance sheet growth and the increase in the interest rate spread and net interest margin during during  interest rates generally declined  resulting in an expansion ie  increase in interest rate spreads and margins 
income from equity interests in real estate decreased  to million from million for during both and  the company recognized gains of million related to sales of real estate properties through the company s non consolidated real estate investments 
excluding the gains on sales of the underlying equity interests  the decrease reflects a decline in the performance of the underlying properties held through equity interests 
as of december   the company had indirect interests in six multi family properties consisting of a total of  rental units  through investments in four limited partnerships and one corporation as a preferred stockholder 
these investments  which had a net carrying value of million at december   comprised less than of the company s total assets 
the company reported a net loss of  on the sale of securities during this net loss was comprised of gross sale gains of million on corporate equity securities and  on corporate debt securities and mbs  net of gross losses from sales of million on corporate debt securities and  on equity securities 
this compares to a net gain of  recognized during the year ended december  resulting from the sale of corporate debt  equity and mortgage backed securities 
during  the company recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on its investment in rcn debt securities 
at december   the company held rcn debt securities  which were carried at their estimated fair value of million 
in addition to rcn debt securities  the corporate debt portfolio included other debt securities designated as held to maturity that were carried at their amortized cost of million which had estimated gross unrealized losses of million 
the investment in the corporate debt securities of level accounted for million of the million of unrealized losses 
general and administrative expenses for the company for the year ended december   increased million as compared to such increase is primarily attributable to higher base management and incentive compensation fees earned by the advisor resulting from an increase in the company s stockholders equity and an increase in income generated by the company 
the company incurred costs in acquiring the advisor of million  of which million was a non cash equity issuance  representing the fair value of the company s common stock issued in the advisor merger 
the company and the advisor merged effective am on january  as a result  the company became self advised and thereafter  has directly incurred the cost of all overhead necessary to operate the company 
critical accounting policies management has the obligation to insure that its policies and methodologies are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
during  management reviewed and evaluated its critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to makes estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgements of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe that there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgement and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company s accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  included in item management believes the more significant of these to be as follows revenue recognition the most significant source of the company s revenue is derived from its investments in mbs 
the company reflects income using the effective yield method  which recognizes periodic income over the term of the investment on a constant yield basis  as adjusted for actual prepayment activity 
management believes the company s revenue recognition policies are appropriate to reflect the substance of the underlying transactions 
other than temporary impairment the company s accounting policies require that management review its investment portfolio for potential other than temporary declines in value on an investment by investment basis 
the majority of the company s investments are in arm mbs which are issued or guaranteed by an agency of the us government  such that management considers it unlikely that these securities will experience substantial declines in value that are due to other than temporary market fluctuations 
for the company s other non real estate investments  management assesses on a quarterly basis significant declines in value which may be considered other than temporary and  if necessary  recognizes an accounting charge to write down the carrying value of such investments 
in making this assessment  management considers a wide range of objective and subjective information  including  but not limited to  the following the magnitude and duration of historical decline in market prices  credit rating activity  assessments of liquidity and public filings and statements made by the issuer  if applicable 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ from these estimates 
impairment of long lived assets real estate investments held directly or through joint ventures represent long lived assets for accounting purposes 
the company periodically reviews long lived assets to be held and used in operations for impairment in value whenever any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
in management s opinion  based on this analysis  real estate held and investments in joint ventures are considered to be held for investment and are not carried at amounts in excess of their estimated fair value 
income taxes the company s financial results generally do no reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that the company has and intends to continue to operate in a manner that will continue to allow it to be taxed as a reit and as a result does not expect to pay substantial corporate level taxes 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if the company were to fail to meet these requirements  the company would be subject to federal income tax 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas 
fas  amends fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  fas by providing alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  fas amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company plans to record option expense for options granted subsequent to january   in accordance with fas  as amended by fas  such change is not expected to have a significant impact on the company 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements  principal payments received on its portfolio of mbs  cash flows generated by operations and proceeds from capital market transactions 
the company s principal uses of cash include purchases of mbs and  to a lesser extent  may include hedge instruments  payments for operating expenses and the payment of dividends on the company s common stock 
repurchase agreements provided an additional billion to finance asset growth during  this increase in leverage was facilitated by the increase in the company s capital as a result of the public stock offerings completed in at december   borrowings under repurchase agreements were billion  compared to billion at december  at december   repurchase agreements had a weighted average borrowing rate of  on loan balances of between  and million 
these agreements generally have original terms to maturity ranging from one to months and interest rates that are typically based off of libor 
to date  the company has not had any margin calls on its repurchase agreements that it was unable to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
during the year ended december   the company completed two public offerings  as detailed below  of its common stock  in which it issued million shares  and raised net proceeds of million 
the company s equity offerings were as follows price gross offering net settlement date number of shares per share proceeds expenses proceeds in thousands  except price per share january      june      includes commissions  discounts and other offering exenses 
on september   the company filed a registration statement with the sec relating to million of its common stock and preferred stock that the company may offer from time to time for cash in a variety of transactions  including underwritten public offerings the shelf registration 
the common stock offerings completed by the company during utilized the securities registered pursuant to this registration statement 
as of december   the company had approximately million of securities remaining on the shelf registration 
to the extent the company raises additional equity capital from future sales of common and or preferred stock pursuant to the shelf registration  the company anticipates using the net proceeds primarily to acquire additional arm mbs 
management may also consider additional interests in multifamily apartment properties and other investments consistent with its operating policies 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to raise additional equity capital at any particular time or on any particular terms 
during  principal payments on mbs generated cash of billion and operations provided a net cash of million 
in addition  the company received proceeds of million  million and million from the sale of investments in corporate debt securities  corporate equity securities and mbs  respectively  during as part of its core investing activities  during  the company acquired billion of arm mbs 
other uses of funds during the year ended december  included million for dividend payments on the company s common stock 
in order to reduce interest rate risk exposure on a portion of the company s libor based repurchase agreements  the company has entered into interest rate cap agreements  costing an aggregate of million 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
additional purchases of cap agreements may be made during the cap agreements will generate future cash if interest rates increase beyond the rate specified in the individual agreement 
the company s restricted cash balance represents cash held on deposit with certain counterparties ie  lenders to satisfy margin calls on repurchase agreements 
the margin calls result from the decline in the value of the mbs securing repurchase agreements  generally due to principal reduction in the mbs from scheduled amortization and prepayments 
at december   the company had of the balance of its repurchase agreements scheduled to roll ie  is contractually mature and payable to the counterparty within the first three months of the significant amount of repurchase agreements scheduled to roll within the first three months of reflects the company s strategy to avoid having a significant amount of repurchase agreements from rolling at or near calendar year end 
at the time a repurchase agreement rolls  the company will apply the restricted cash against the repurchase agreement balance  thereby reducing the borrowed balance 
effective january   the company became a self advised reit and has since directly incurred all costs associated with conducting its business 
the company believes it has adequate financial resources to meet its obligations as they come due and to fund committed dividends as well as to actively pursue its investment policies 
inflation virtually all of the company s assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors drive the company s performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates and changes in inflation rates 
the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles while dividends are based upon net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  the company s activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
other matters the company at all times intends to conduct its business so as to not become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act 
if the company were to become regulated as an investment company  then  among other things  the company s ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring qualifying interests 
under the current interpretation of the staff of the sec  in order to qualify for this exemption  the company must maintain at least of its assets directly in qualifying interests 
in addition  unless certain mbs represent an undivided interest in the entire pool backing such mbs ie  whole pool mbs  such mbs may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loan and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the exemption requirement 
accordingly  the company monitors its compliance with this requirement in order to maintain its exempt status 
as of december   the company determined that it is in and has maintained compliance with this requirement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment and credit risks inherent in all financial institutions in a prudent manner designed to insure the longevity of the company while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive total rates of return through stock ownership of the company 
while the company does not seek to avoid risk  it does seek  to the best of its ability  to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risk  to achieve returns that justify the taking of such risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with its risk posture 
interest rate risk the company primarily invests in arm mbs  which include hybrid mbs that have fixed rate coupons for a specified period  generally not greater than three years at the time of purchase  and thereafter convert to variable rate coupons 
most of the company s adjustable rate assets are dependent on the one year cmt rate while the company s repurchase agreements are generally priced off of libor 
these indexes generally move in parallel  but there can be no assurance that this will continue to occur 
at december   the company had of its arm mbs portfolio repricing from the one year cmt index  repricing from the one year libor index and repricing from the th district cost of funds index ie  cofi 
the company s adjustable rate investment assets and repurchase agreements reset on different dates for the specific asset or obligation 
in general  the repricing of the company s repurchase obligations occurs more quickly than the repricing of assets 
therefore  the company s cost of funds would likely rise or fall more quickly than would its earnings rate on assets 
the following table presents the company s interest rate risk using the static gap methodology 
the table presents the difference between the carrying value of the company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december   based on the earlier of term to repricing or the term to repayment of the asset or liability  scheduled principal amortization is not reflected in the table 
further  the arm mbs can be prepaid before contractual amortization and or maturity  which is also not reflected in the table 
the table does not include assets and liabilities that are not interest rate sensitive 
as of december   the company s investment assets and debt obligations will contractually reprice based on the following time frames as of december  in thousands less than three months one year to two years to beyond three months to one year two years year three three years total interest earning assets arm mbs      fixed rate mbs   debt securities equity securities total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities repurchase agreements     total interest bearing liabilities     interest sensitivity gap       cumulative interest sensitivity gap      the difference between assets and liabilities repricing or maturing in a given period is one approximate measure of interest rate sensitivity 
when more assets than liabilities reprice during a period  the gap is considered positive and it is anticipated that earnings will increase as interest rates rise and earnings will decrease as interest rates decline 
when more liabilities reprice than assets during a given period  as is the case with respect to the company for periods less than one year  the gap is considered negative 
with a negative gap it is anticipated that income will decline as interest rates increase and income will increase as interest rates decline 
the static gap analysis does not reflect the constraints on the repricing of arm mbs in a given period resulting from periodic and life time cap features on these securities  nor the behavior of various indexes applicable to the company s assets and liabilities 
the actual repricing can and will likely be affected by prepayments on the company s mbs portfolio 
to a limited extent  the company uses interest rate cap agreements as part of its interest rate risk management 
the notional amounts of these instruments are not reflected in the company s balance sheet 
the cap agreements that hedge against increases in interest rates on the company s libor based repurchase agreements are not considered in the static gap analysis  as they do not effect the timing of the repricing of the instruments they hedge  but rather to the extent of the notional amount  cap the limit on the amount of interest rate change that can occur relative to the applicable of the hedged liability 
market value risk substantially all of the company s investments are designated as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at their estimated fair value  with the difference between amortized cost and fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  included under item the market value of the company s mbs assets fluctuate primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors  however  given that of the company s assets are issued or guaranteed by an agency of the us government  such fluctuations are generally not based on the underlying creditworthiness 
during  the company liquidated its portfolio of corporate debt and equity securities  eliminating the market risks associated with such investments 
see risk factors risks of decline in market value liquidity risk the primary liquidity risk for the company arises from financing long maturity assets  which have interim and life time interest rate adjustment caps  with short term debt in the form of repurchase agreements 
although the interest rate adjustments of assets and liabilities are managed through the company s operating policies  maturities are not matched 
the company s assets which are pledged to secure short term borrowings are high quality  liquid assets 
as a result  the company has not had difficulty rolling over ie  renewing its short term debt as it matures 
however  the company cannot give assurances that it will always be able to roll over its short term debt 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million available to meet margin calls on repurchase agreements and for other corporate purposes 
the company had no long term debt at december  prepayment and reinvestment risk the company typically pays a premium over the par value of its mbs upon acquisition 
as the company receives repayments of principal on its mbs  premiums are amortized  thereby reducing interest income 
discounts  to the extent the company owns mbs with a discount to par value  are accreted to interest income 
premiums arise when the company acquires mbs at a price in excess of the principal value of the mortgages or par value if purchased at the original issue 
conversely  discounts arise when the company acquires mbs at a price below the principal value of the mortgages  or par  if purchased at original issue 
for financial accounting purposes  the premium is amortized using the effective yield method  which reflects the effect of prepayments on amortization of premium and accretion of discounts 
greater than anticipated prepayments will accelerate the amortization of premiums  thereby reducing interest income 
for tax accounting purposes  premiums are amortized based on the asset yield at the purchase date 
therefore  on a tax basis  amortization of premiums will differ from those reported for financial purposes 
at december   the gross unamortized premium for the mbs in the company s portfolio for financial accounting purposes was million of the mbs portfolio compared with million for federal tax purposes 
in general  the company believes it will be able to reinvest proceeds from scheduled principal payments and prepayments at acceptable yields  however  no assurances can be given that  should significant prepayments occur  market conditions would be such that acceptable investments could be identified and the proceeds reinvested 
tabular presentation the information presented in the following table  projects the potential impact of sudden changes in interest rates on projected net income and net assets based on the investments in the company s portfolio on december   and includes the company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the company acquires interest rate sensitive assets and funds them with interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the company generally plans to retain such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity 
change in percentage change percentage change interest rates in net income in net assets many assumptions are made to present the information in the above table  as such  there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes  therefore  the above table and all related disclosure constitutes forward looking statements 
the analysis presented utilizes assumptions and estimates based on management s judgment and experience 
furthermore  future sales  acquisitions and restructuring could materially change the company s interest rate risk profile 
the table quantifies the potential changes in net income and net asset value should interest rates immediately change shock 
the results of interest rate shocks of plus and basis points are presented  while rate shock declines are limited to and basis points  as a greater decline would result in negative interest rates for certain of the interest rate indexes that drive the repricing of some of the company s assets and liabilities 
the cash flows associated with the portfolio of arm mbs for each rate shock are calculated based on a variety of assumptions  including prepayment speeds  time until coupon reset  yield on future acquisitions  slope of the yield curve and size of the portfolio 
assumptions made on the interest rate sensitive liabilities  which are repurchase agreements  include anticipated interest rates  collateral requirements as a percent of the repurchase agreement and amount of borrowing 
assumptions made in calculating the impact on net asset value of interest rate shocks include interest rates  prepayment rates and the yield spread of arm mbs relative to prevailing interest rates 
the company s asset liability structure is generally such that a decrease in interest rates would be expected to result in an increase to net interest income  as the company s cost of funds are generally shorter term than the company s interest earning assets 
however  given the impact of prepayment assumptions and other assumptions coupled with the low level of interest rates at december   the interest rate shocks presented in the above table would cause net income to decrease under each of the interest rate shock scenarios presented 
when interest rates are shocked  prepayment assumptions are adjusted based on management s best estimate of the effects of changes in interest rates on prepayment speeds 
for example  under current market conditions  a basis point decline in interest rates is estimated to result in a increase in the prepayment rate of the arm mbs portfolio 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table
