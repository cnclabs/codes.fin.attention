overview the company is one of the smallest publicly traded semiconductor makers 
following its formation  the company initially developed plug compatible second source products that were form  fit  and function compatible with products offered by other manufacturers 
beginning in  the company began identifying unique  proprietary products driven by its existing customer base 
while this transition to proprietary products required the company to obtain advanced design automation tools and to increase the number of people involved in product development  it enabled the company to focus its sales channels and limit the costs of those channels  and to compete in markets with pricing and delivery demands that are not as highly competitive as the markets for second source products 
the company s focus on proprietary dsp products continues  as it primarily derives its revenues from the sale of semiconductor chips that perform high speed dsp in video image filtering and digital communications applications 
the company s transition to a proprietary product focus has had a significant impact on its financial results 
in  the company recorded significant write downs of inventory and long lived assets  as it recognized the obsolescence of its more mature  second source products 
the company anticipated increased revenues from the hdtv market starting in  but the delays in the broadcast industry s transition to high definition from analog signals resulted in less revenues from these products than the company anticipated 
in the meantime  revenues from the company s older second source products dropped dramatically as they were obsoleted 
therefore  while the company s revenues have decreased over the past few years  revenues from newer products have actually increased to partially take the place of revenues from mature  second source products 
in addition  the events of september  and the war on terrorism resulted in the company receiving approximately  in sales to a defense contractor for the cruise missile program during fiscal the company anticipated receiving additional revenues from the military programs during fiscal  however  these revenues were relatively insignificant 
the company anticipates revenues from its newer proprietary products to increase if the hdtv market begins to ramp up as a result of recent fcc actions 
among other things  in august  the fcc issued an order to television manufacturers that requires digital tuners to be incorporated into percent of the television sets with screens of or more inches starting in  into percent of the sets with screens of inches starting in  and into all sets with screens of inches or more by on october   the us court of appeals for the us circuit upheld the fcc mandate that  by  all but the very smallest television sets sold in the us must be equipped for receiving digital  along with traditional analog  television signals 
the court said the fcc s mandate was needed because the industry was not moving quickly enough to make new tuners available 
notwithstanding the impact of the stalled transition in the broadcasting industry and the overall downturn in the economy  the company has strengthened its balance sheet in the last few years 
as a result of the reorganization  aggressive expenditure controls  limitations on capital expenditures  reductions of inventory levels  and increased revenues from military programs  the company has increased its cash balance by  percent from fiscal to fiscal  while reducing its total liabilities by percent during the same period 
the company s fiscal year is comprised of weeks of seven days  each beginning on monday and ending on sunday  with each year s fiscal quarters comprised of exactly weeks 
the company s last three fiscal years ended on september   september   and september   respectively 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net revenues for fiscal decreased percent  from  in fiscal to  this decrease was due to the continued down cycle of the semiconductor industry  the continued sluggish economy  and the prolonged delay in hdtv broadcasting 
these factors limited the company s commercial product revenues to only a slight increase in fiscal compared to however  a sharp drop in sales of chips to military programs adversely impacted the company s overall revenues in fiscal during fiscal  approximately percent of revenues were derived from sales to defense contractors  while fiscal defense related sales were insignificant 
while the company s net revenues decreased percent  the company s cost of revenues also decreased by percent 
the company was able to reduce the cost of revenues at a rate proportional to the drop in revenues  in spite of having certain overhead expenses that are relatively fixed  due to aggressive cost cutting for the past several years 
in addition  during fiscal  the company obsoleted  and scrapped  of inventory  both of which are reflected in the cost of revenues 
the company s gross profit decreased percent from  in fiscal to  in fiscal gross profit as a percent of revenues increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal research and development expenditures increased less than one percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the company believes that new product development is a key ingredient for future growth and elected to maintain research and development levels in spite of the drop in revenues 
as a result  research and development expenditures  as a percentage of net revenues  increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased slightly from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the company was able to contain sg a expenses as a result of on going cost control efforts 
as a result of the significant decrease in revenues and the sustained funding of research and development levels  the company had a net loss from operations of  in fiscal  compared to a net loss from operations of  in fiscal because the company had essentially no borrowing during fiscal  it had no interest expense  compared to  in fiscal due to the above factors  the company experienced a net loss of  in fiscal compared to a net loss of  in fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net revenues for fiscal decreased percent  from  in fiscal to  this decrease was largely due to the continued down cycle of the semiconductor industry  the continued sluggish economy  and the prolonged delay in hdtv broadcasting 
while commercial revenues decreased significantly in  the company s revenues were aided by the sales of approximately  in military parts to a defense contractor for the cruise missile program 
as the company s net revenues decreased percent  the cost of revenues also decreased by percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the cost of revenues did not decrease as much as the net revenues  as the company has certain overhead expenses that are relatively fixed  such as taxes  insurance  and lease expenditures 
in addition  during fiscal  the company wrote off  of inventory and expensed an inventory reserve of  both of which are reflected in cost of revenues 
the company s gross profit decreased percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal in addition  the gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal  mainly as a result of generally fixed overhead expenses with lower revenues 
research and development expenses decreased eight percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal while the company continues to believe that product development is a key ingredient for future success and growth  its lower revenues forced it to cut additional costs in the research and development area 
this decrease was primarily the result of employee layoffs 
as a percent of net revenues  research and development expense increased from percent to percent 
however  if the company s net revenues had remained consistent with the prior year  research and development would have been approximately percent of net revenues  which is near the company s target of percent 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased slightly from  in fiscal to  in fiscal while the company continues to attempt to control its costs  it experienced increased costs for the move of its headquarters 
however  the company felt the move was necessary  as it anticipates future costs for the new facility will be approximately percent less than the old facility 
further  the company determined the goodwill from the acquisition of assets from star semiconductor was fully impaired and wrote off the remaining balance of approximately  at the end of fiscal as a result of the significant decrease in revenues and the disproportionate decrease in expenses  the company had a loss from operations of  in fiscal  compared to a loss of  in fiscal interest expense decreased percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  as a result of the company carrying no balance on its line of credit for the majority of the fiscal year  prior to the line s expiration  and the expiration of the majority of the company s capital lease obligations 
due to the significant decrease in revenues and the relatively fixed nature of certain of its costs  the company experienced a net loss of  in fiscal  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company s operations produced  of net cash  despite its  net loss 
this was mainly the result of the net collection of accounts receivable of  and a decrease in prepaid expenses of  at the same time  the company attempted to maintain its prompt payment terms with vendors  so accounts payable decreased  the company used some of the cash from operations to purchase capital assets aggregating  and to fund the repurchase of  of its common stock on the open market 
the company s cash position increased from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal during fiscal  the company produced net cash of  from operations  despite its  net loss 
while the company spent  for prepaid expenses   for accounts payable  and  for accrued expenses  it netted  from accounts receivable collections 
in addition  the company was able to produce  from its inventories as many of its fiscal revenues were shipped from existing stock 
the company used some of the cash from operations to fund capital expenditures of  and to repay capital lease obligations of  the company s cash position increased from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal during fiscal  the company used net cash of  in operations  as a result of the net loss of  and an increase in accounts receivable of  the downturn in the industry and the economy  as a whole  caused many of the company s customers to pay to days past due 
while certain customers extended payments  the company maintained its current schedule of paying vendors within terms  without drawing on its then existing line of credit 
this also contributed to the net cash used in operations  as the company reduced accrued expenses by  paid  for capital expenditures  and repaid capital leases aggregating  fortunately  the company was able to reduce its physical inventories by  and its inventory reserves by  which saved it from expending additional cash in operations 
the company s current working capital requirements are greatly reduced due to the cost cutting of the past few years 
the company believes that these cost cutting actions and its continued focus on higher margin products should result in after tax cash earnings being sufficient to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
based on the fact that  as of december   it holds approximately  in cash reserves and its cash usage for operations is approximately equal to or less than its current revenue rate  the company believes it can cover its cash operating expenses using future revenues  while saving current cash reserves for the stock repurchase plan and future capital expenditures  such as mask tooling for new products 
working capital the company s investment in inventories has been significant and will continue to be significant in the future 
however  over the past few years  the company has been able to reduce its levels of inventories as it shifts from more competitive second source products to proprietary sole source products 
the company believes it will be able to streamline its inventories as it continues its shift to sole source proprietary products 
it also intends to continue its shortened accounts receivable collection cycle by re focusing on direct sales to customers rather than through distribution channels 
the company relies on third party suppliers for its raw materials  particularly its processed wafers  for which it currently relies primarily on one supplier  and as a result  maintains substantial inventory levels to protect against disruption in supplies 
the company has periodically experienced disruptions in obtaining wafers 
as the company continues to shift towards higher margin proprietary products  it expects to be able to reduce inventory levels by streamlining its product offerings 
periodically  the company reviews inventory to determine recoverability of items on hand using the lower of cost or market locom and excess methods 
the company groups and evaluates its products based on their underlying die or wafer type the company s raw materials  silicon wafers  can generally be used to make multiple products  to determine the total quantity on hand and average unit costs 
management uses judgment in comparing the sales quantities for up to the prior fiscal months to the quantity on hand at the end of the fiscal year 
if the quantity on hand exceeds the sales quantities  the company provides a reserve for the potentially obsolete or slow moving items 
for the locom analysis  the company compared the average sales price to the average unit cost of inventories at the end of the fiscal year 
if the average unit cost exceeds the average sales price  the company provides a reserve 
during fiscal and  the company s locom and excess reserves totaled  and  respectively 
with the continuing slow economic conditions  the company felt it necessary to review its raw materials and work in process as well 
during fiscal  the company obsoleted  of work in process inventory and scrapped an additional  which were directly expensed to the cost of revenues 
during fiscal  the company directly wrote off  of its inventory  using its prior year reserve of  plus an additional  against cost of revenues 
the company believes its current reserve of  for locom and excess inventory provides a reasonable estimate of the recoverability of inventories at the end of fiscal although current levels of inventory impact the company s liquidity  the company believes that this is a less costly alternative to owning a wafer fabrication facility 
the company continues to evaluate alternative suppliers to diversify its risk of supply disruption 
however  this requires a significant investment in product development to tool masks with new suppliers 
such efforts compete for the company s limited product development resources 
the company seeks to achieve on going reductions in inventory  although there can be no assurance it will be successful 
in the event economic conditions remain slow  the company may consider identifying additional portions of inventory to write off at a future date 
historically  due to customer order scheduling  up to of the quarterly revenues were often shipped in the last month of the quarter  so a large portion of the shipments included in year end accounts receivable were not yet due per the company s net day terms 
this results in year end accounts receivable balances being at their highest point for the respective period 
financing on july   the company elected not to renew its  revolving line of credit with its bank 
while the company will continue to evaluate future debt and equity financing opportunities  it feels the cost reductions taken in the past few years have resulted in the cash flow generated from operations providing an adequate base of liquidity to fund future operating and capital needs 
based on the fact that  as of december   it holds approximately  in cash reserves and its anticipated cash usage for operations is approximately equal to or less than its current revenue rate  the company believes it can cover its cash operating expenses using future revenues  while saving current cash reserves for the stock repurchase plan and future capital expenditures  such as mask tooling for new products 
impact of new financial accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reporting containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  because the company accounts for the compensation cost associated with its stock option plans under the intrinsic value method  the alternative methods of transition will not apply to the company 
the additional disclosure requirements of the statement are included in these financial statements 
in management s opinion  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company conducts all of its transactions  including those with foreign suppliers and customers  in us dollars 
it is therefore not directly subject to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations and does not hedge or otherwise deal in currency instruments in an attempt to minimize such risks 
of course  demand from foreign customers and the ability or willingness of foreign suppliers to perform their obligations to the company may be affected by the relative change in value of such customer or supplier s domestic currency to the value of the us dollar 
furthermore  changes in the relative value of the us dollar may change the price of the company s prices relative to the prices of its foreign competitors 
the company also does not hold any market risk sensitive instruments that are not considered cash under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america
