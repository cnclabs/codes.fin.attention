item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our primary business segment is advanta business cards  one of the nation s largest issuers of business credit cards to small businesses 
in addition to our business credit card lending business  we have venture capital investments 
through the first quarter of  we had two additional lending businesses  advanta mortgage and advanta leasing services 
in the first quarter of  we completed our exit from the mortgage business  announced the discontinuance of our leasing business  and restructured our corporate functions to a size commensurate with our ongoing businesses 
we are continuing to service the existing leasing portfolio rather than sell the business or the portfolio 
the results of the mortgage and leasing businesses are reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented 
the results of our ongoing businesses are reported as continuing operations for all periods presented

we also recorded an after tax loss on the discontinuance of our leasing business of million  or per combined diluted common share  effective december  the components of the after tax loss on discontinuance recorded in include a pretax loss on the mortgage transaction of million  a pretax gain on the discontinuance of our leasing business of million  and tax benefit of million 
the components of the after tax loss on discontinuance recorded in include a pretax gain on the mortgage transaction of million  a pretax loss on the discontinuance of our leasing business of million  and tax expense of million 
see discontinued operations in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion 
loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  was million  or per combined diluted common share  for the period from january  through february   the effective date of the mortgage transaction 
in the year ended december   loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  was million  or per combined diluted common share 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following as our most critical accounting policies and estimates in that they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
changes in such estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
fair value of venture capital investments investments of our venture capital segment are included in investments available for sale and carried at estimated fair value 
management makes fair value determinations based on quoted market prices  when available  and considers the investees financial results  conditions and prospects  values of comparable companies and market liquidity  when market prices are not available 
in accordance with specialized industry accounting principles of venture capital companies  unrealized and realized gains and losses on these investments are included in other revenues in the consolidated income statements 
the fair values of these equity investments are subject to significant volatility 
our investments in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time  and changes in concentrations may affect price volatility 
we primarily invest in privately held companies  including early stage companies 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products the investees have under development may never materialize 
allowance for receivable losses the allowance for receivable losses is maintained for on balance sheet receivables and is intended to cover all losses inherent in the owned receivable portfolio 
business credit card receivables are comprised of principal amounts due from cardholders for purchase activities and cash advances  and amounts due from cardholders relating to billed interest and fees 
the allowance for receivable losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibility of receivables in light of historical experience by loan type  the nature and volume of the receivable portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay and prevailing economic conditions 
since our receivable portfolio is comprised of large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  we generally evaluate each group collectively for impairment through the use of a migration analysis as well as the consideration of other factors that may indicate loss 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
provisions for credit losses  representing the portion of receivable losses attributable to principal  are reported separately on the consolidated income statements 
losses are charged against the allowance for receivable losses when management believes the uncollectibility of a receivable balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance for receivable losses 
provisions for interest and fee losses are recorded as direct reductions to interest and fee income 
the accrued interest and fee portion of charged off receivables is charged against the allowance for receivable losses 
all subsequent recoveries of charged off receivables are classified as principal recoveries  since any amounts related to accrued interest and fees are de minimus 
securitization transactions a significant portion of our funding for advanta business cards is through off balance sheet business credit card securitizations using a securitization trust 
the securitization trust was created to hold the collateral the securitized receivables and issue debt to investors 
the securitization trust is a qualifying special purpose entity as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
 and therefore  is not consolidated as part of advanta corp 
s consolidated financial statements 
we do not provide any guarantee of the debt issued by the special purpose entity and our recourse in the transactions is limited to the value of our interests in securitizations that serve as credit enhancement to the investors interests in the securitized receivables 
our business credit card securitization transactions are accounted for as sales since we surrender control over the securitized receivables 
securitization income is recognized at the time of the sale  equal to the excess of the fair value of the assets obtained principally cash over the allocated cost of the assets sold and transaction costs 
fair value estimates used in the recognition of securitization income require assumptions of payment  default and interest rates 
to the extent actual results are different than those estimates  the impact is recognized in securitization income 
we generally retain an interest in securitized receivables in the form of restricted cash reserve accounts  retained interest only strips and subordinated trust assets related to securitizations 
subordinated trust assets represent an ownership interest in the securitized receivables that is subordinated to the other investors interests 
retained interests in securitizations serve as credit enhancement to the investors interests in the securitized receivables 
these assets are carried at estimated fair value and the resulting unrealized gain or loss from the valuation is included in securitization income 
we estimate the fair value of retained interests in securitizations based on a discounted cash flow analysis when quoted market prices are not available 
the cash flows of the retained interest only strip are estimated as the excess of the weighted average interest yield on each pool of the receivables sold over the sum of the interest rate earned by the note holder  the servicing fee and an estimate of future credit losses over the life of the existing receivables 
cash flows are discounted from the date the cash is expected to become available to us the cash out method 
these cash flows are projected over the life of the receivables using payment  default  and interest rate assumptions that management believes would be used by market participants for similar financial instruments subject to prepayment  credit and interest rate risk 
the cash flows are discounted using an interest rate that management believes a purchaser unrelated to the seller of the financial instrument would demand 
as estimates used are influenced by factors outside our control  there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates  making it reasonably possible that they could change in the near term 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the key assumptions used in the estimation of fair values of the retained interest in securitizations at december  and interest income is recognized over the life of the retained interests in securitizations using the discount rate used in the valuation 
accrued interest and fees on securitized receivables are reduced by an allowance for amounts estimated to be uncollectible 
the allowance is estimated using the same methodology as that used for on balance sheet receivables that is described above in allowance for receivable losses 
provisions for interest and fee losses on securitized receivables are recorded as a reduction of securitization income 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
the interpretation requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if the company has variable interests that give it a majority of the expected losses or a majority of the expected residual returns of the entity 
the consolidation requirements apply to all variable interest entities created after january  in addition  public companies must apply the consolidation requirements to variable interest entities that existed prior to february  and remain in existence as of the beginning of annual or interim periods beginning after june  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this interpretation will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations since qualifying special purpose entities  as defined in sfas  are exempt from the consolidation requirements of this interpretation 
business credit card rewards programs we offer bonus mile and cash back reward programs with certain of our business credit cards 
eligible cardholders earn bonus miles for air travel or up to cash back rewards based on net purchases charged on their business credit card account 
the costs of future reward redemptions are estimated and a liability is recorded at the time bonus miles or cash back rewards are earned by the cardholder 
the estimated costs of future reward redemptions are classified as a reduction of other revenues in the consolidated income statements 
estimates of costs of future reward redemptions include an assumption regarding the percentage of cardholders that will redeem the rewards and vary depending on the structure of the rewards program 
it is reasonably possible that actual results will differ from our estimates or that our estimated liability for these programs may change 
litigation contingencies advanta corp 
and its subsidiaries are involved in class action lawsuits  other litigation  claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or discontinued operations  including litigation arising from our operation of the mortgage business prior to the mortgage transaction in the first quarter of see discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the aggregate loss  if any  resulting from these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of our operations based on the level of litigation reserves we have established and our current expectations regarding the ultimate resolutions of these existing actions 
our litigation reserves are estimated based on the status of litigation and our assessment of the ultimate resolution of each action after consultation with our attorneys 
however  due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and since the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings are influenced by factors outside of our control  it is reasonably possible that our estimated liability under these proceedings may change or that actual results will differ from our estimates 
our litigation reserves are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
changes in estimates or other charges related to litigation are included in operating expenses of the respective business segment if related to continuing operations  or gain loss on discontinuance of mortgage and leasing businesses if related to discontinued operations 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the asset and liability or balance sheet method 
under this method  we determine the net deferred tax asset or liability based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various assets and liabilities and give current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax asset and recognize a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in establishing the valuation allowance  we consider estimates of expected future taxable income  existing and projected book tax differences  tax planning strategies available  and the general and industry specific economic outlook 
this analysis is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
changes in estimate of deferred tax asset realizability  if applicable  are included in income tax expense benefit on the consolidated income statements and would affect all business segments since the consolidated effective tax rate is applied to all business segments pretax income loss 
discontinued operations our exit from the mortgage business and discontinuance of the leasing business represent the disposal of business segments following accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accordingly  results of these operations are classified as discontinued in all periods presented 
our accounting for discontinued operations was not impacted by the issuance of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  since its provisions for disposal groups of long lived assets are effective for disposal activities initiated after january  estimates of future cash flows are used in the accounting for discontinued operations  including estimates of the future costs of mortgage business related litigation and estimates of operating results through the remaining term of the leasing portfolio 
as all estimates used are influenced by factors outside our control  there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates  making it reasonably possible that they could change in the near term 
changes in estimates related to discontinued operations are included in gain loss on discontinuance of mortgage and leasing businesses on the consolidated income statements 
advanta business cards advanta business cards originated  directly and through the use of third parties   new accounts during the year ended december    new accounts in and  new accounts in our managed business credit card receivable portfolio is comprised of both owned business credit card receivables and securitized business credit card receivables 
managed business credit card receivables grew in the year ended december  and in the year ended december  we expect managed business credit card receivables to grow approximately to in the year ended december  our originations in included a broader array of competitively priced offerings and products  including promotional pricing and rewards programs  designed to selectively attract and retain more higher credit quality customers and to respond to the competitive environment in the credit card industry 
the level of originations and growth in receivables in reflected our plan to grow the portfolio in a controlled manner that we believed was prudent given the prevailing economic environment 
pretax income for advanta business cards was million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the components of pretax income for advanta business cards in the years ended december were as follows in thousands net interest income on owned receivables    noninterest revenues    provision for credit losses    operating expenses    pretax income    net interest income on owned receivables and noninterest revenues in reflect a decrease in the average yield earned on our owned and securitized business credit card receivables 
the decrease in yield is a result of a broader array of competitively priced offerings and products in  including promotional pricing  designed to selectively attract and retain more higher credit quality customers and to respond to the competitive environment 
the increase in net interest income on owned receivables in as compared to is due to a million increase in average owned business credit card receivables and a decrease in our cost of funds  partially offset by the decrease in average yield earned on our owned business credit card receivables 
the increase in noninterest revenues in as compared to is comprised of increased securitization income  servicing revenues  interchange income and other fee revenues due to the growth in average managed receivables 
securitization income was also impacted by the decrease in yield on securitized receivables discussed above  a decrease in the interest rate earned by noteholders and an increased net charge off rate on securitized receivables 
the increase in the provision for credit losses in as compared to reflects an increase in average owned business credit card receivables  partially offset by estimates as of december  of a lower level of inherent losses in the portfolio  based on delinquency and net charge off rate trends and the current composition of the portfolio  as compared to estimates as of december  the increase in operating expenses in as compared to resulted from growth in managed receivables and additional investments in initiatives to strengthen our position as a leading issuer of business credit cards to the small business market 
the increase in noninterest revenues and operating expenses in as compared to was due primarily to growth in managed receivables 
the provisions for credit losses and noninterest revenues in the year ended december  include the impact of an increase in managed credit losses due to the seasoning of the business credit card portfolio and the economic environment during the period 
the provision for credit losses in the year ended december  includes an million increase attributable to a revision of our estimate of the allowance for receivable losses as a result of the following factors discussions with our banking regulators relating to the implementation of the agreement between advanta bank corp 
and the federal deposit insurance corporation that was disclosed in june  changes in the economic environment  and the use of more conservative loss estimates for certain segments of the loan portfolio 
see further discussion in the provision and allowance for receivable losses section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
venture capital the components of pretax income loss for our venture capital segment in the years ended december were as follows in thousands net interest expense   realized gains losses  net   unrealized losses  net    other revenues operating expenses    pretax income loss    as shown in the table above  pretax income loss of our venture capital segment is comprised primarily of realized and unrealized gains and losses on our venture capital investments  which reflect the market conditions for those investments in each respective period  and operating expenses 
the estimated fair value of our venture capital investments was million at december   and million at december  interest income and expense interest income decreased by million to million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest income in was due primarily to a decrease in the average yield earned on our investments and receivables as a result of the prevailing interest rate environment and the competitively priced offers described below 
also contributing to the decrease in interest income was a decrease in average federal funds sold  restricted interest bearing deposits and investments of million for the year ended december  as compared to excess liquid assets resulting from the mortgage transaction in the first quarter of were held in short term  high quality investments until they could be deployed 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases in average business credit card receivables of million in the year ended december  as compared to in  our marketing campaigns have included a broader array of competitively priced offerings and products  including promotional pricing and rewards programs  designed to selectively attract and retain more higher credit quality customers and to respond to the competitive environment 
in the year ended december   these competitively priced offers resulted in a decline in yields on business credit card receivables  and are anticipated to result in lower credit losses in future periods and higher interchange income due to higher purchase volume 
we anticipate that these trends on business credit card receivables will continue in and that our risk adjusted revenues as a percentage of average managed business credit card receivables will be between and in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  risk adjusted revenues represent net interest margin and fee revenues  less net principal charge offs 
during the year ended december   interest expense decreased by million to million as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense in was due to a reduction in average outstanding deposits and debt and a decrease in our average cost of funds 
our average cost of funds decreased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  the decrease in our average cost of funds is primarily a result of the prevailing interest rate environment 
interest income decreased by million to million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  during the same period  interest expense decreased by million to million 
the decrease in interest income was due primarily to a decrease in average business credit card receivables and investments 
also contributing to the decreased interest income was a decrease in the average yield earned on our investment portfolio caused by the interest rate environment and a shift in the composition of the portfolio 
short term investments  including federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits  represented of the average investment portfolio in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was due to a decrease in interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by an increase in our average cost of funds

the increase in both provisions reflects growth in average owned business credit card receivables of million in the year ended december  as compared to  partially offset by a reduction in our estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio as of december   based on improving delinquency and charge off rate trends from april to december and the current composition of the portfolio as compared to our estimate as of december  in  we were anticipating worsening net charge off rates for the first quarter of due to the composition and seasoning of the portfolio at december  delinquency and charge off rate trends on owned business credit card receivables dec

 receivables days or more delinquent receivables days or more delinquent net principal charge offs as a of owned business credit card receivables for the three months ended annualized the improvements in delinquency rates are the result of the current composition of the portfolio and enhancements in the collections area of operations 
in june  we ceased origination of business credit card accounts with fair  isaac and company fico credit scores of less than we estimate that charge offs for accounts with fico credit scores of less than at origination reached their peak in the first quarter of  based on the average age of that segment of the portfolio 
although charge off levels are not always predictable since they are impacted by the economic environment and other factors beyond our control  we anticipate charge off rates for the year ended december  and for each quarter of to be lower than the comparable periods of this expectation is based on the current composition of the portfolio that reflects our strategic initiative to selectively attract and retain more higher credit quality customers  enhancements in the collections area of operations made in  and the current level of delinquencies 
however  we are expecting charge off rates in the first and second quarters of to be higher than the rate experienced in the fourth quarter of  due to the current level of receivables days or more delinquent and historical seasonal trends of charge offs and bankruptcy petitions 
the provision for credit losses in the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the year ended december  the provision for interest and fee losses was million in as compared to million in the provision for credit losses in includes a revision in our estimate of the allowance for receivable losses on business credit card receivables 
the revised estimate for the overall portfolio was recorded in september and was developed based on discussions with our banking regulators  changes in the economic environment and the use of more conservative loss estimates for certain segments of the receivable portfolio 
those segments included accounts with lower credit scores  accounts held by businesses in operation less than twelve months  and accounts in which cash borrowings comprise a significant portion of the outstanding balance 
as a result of these changes in estimate in  we increased our allowance for receivable losses by approximately million  which increased the provision for credit losses and decreased net income by approximately million or per diluted combined share for the year ended december  the provisions for credit losses and interest and fee losses in reflect the seasoning of the business credit card portfolio and the economic environment 
these factors were evident in the delinquency rates and charge off rates in as compared to total owned business credit card receivables days or more delinquent increased from at december  to at december  the charge off rate on owned business credit card receivables for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  at december   the allowance for receivable losses on a consolidated basis was million  or of owned receivables  compared to million  or  at december  the allowance for receivable losses on business credit card receivables was million  or of owned receivables  at december   as compared to million  or  at december  the allowance for receivable losses on other receivables was million at december  and thousand at december  the increase in the allowance for receivable losses on other receivables in the year ended december  was due to general economic conditions and corresponding increases in delinquency rates 
the rate of other receivables days or more delinquent was at december  as compared to at december  we follow the charge off and re age policies established by the uniform retail credit classification and account management policy issued by the federal financial institutions examination council 
under this policy  unpaid receivables are charged off in the month the account becomes days contractually delinquent  unpaid balances of accounts that declare hardship or enter credit counseling are charged off in the month the account becomes days contractually delinquent  unpaid receivables of accounts in bankruptcy are charged off within days of receipt of notification of filing from the bankruptcy court or within the previous timeframes discussed  whichever is shorter  and fraudulent amounts are charged off after a day investigative period  unless our investigation shows no evidence of fraud 
prior to october   unpaid receivables of accounts in bankruptcy were charged off within days of receipt of notification of filing from the bankruptcy court 
in july  the bank regulatory agencies issued draft guidance on account management and loss allowance for credit card lending 
it described the agencies expectations for prudent risk management practices for credit card activities  particularly with regard to credit line management  over limit accounts  and workouts 
the draft guidance also addressed income recognition and loss allowance practices for credit card lending 
we completed our evaluation of the draft guidance in and did not expect the implementation of the guidance to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations 
in january  the bank regulatory agencies issued the final guidance 
the guidance includes provisions generally applicable to all credit card issuers 
we are still evaluating the impact the minimum payment provisions may have on our future delinquencies and charge offs 
we do not expect the other provisions of the final guidance to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations 
however  similar to other examination guidance  this guidance provides wide discretion to the bank regulatory agencies in the application to any particular institution 
accordingly  our bank examiners could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices in the future 
the following table provides credit quality data as of and for the year to date periods indicated for our on balance sheet receivable portfolio including a summary of allowances for receivable losses  nonaccrual receivables  accruing receivables past due days or more  delinquencies and charge offs

bankrupt business credit cards are charged off within a day investigative period after receipt of notification 
the previous policy provided a day investigative period 
business credit card principal charge offs for the year ended december  include a acceleration of charge offs in connection with the adoption of this policy 
securitization income securitization income was million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december   and million in the year ended december  the increase in securitization income in as compared to was due primarily to increased volume of securitized receivables 
securitization income in was also impacted by a decline in yields on securitized receivables  a decrease in the interest rate earned by note holders  and an increased net charge off rate on securitized receivables 
these fluctuations in yields and rates are similar to those experienced in on balance sheet business credit card receivables as discussed in the interest income and expense and provision and allowance for receivable losses sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in  we anticipate an increase in the volume of securitized receivables  as a result of anticipated receivables growth  which is expected to result in an increase in securitization income as compared to the increase in securitization income in as compared to was due to increased volume of securitized receivables and increased yields on securitized receivables  partially offset by increased charge offs on securitized receivables 
managed receivable data performance on a managed receivable portfolio basis is relevant because we retain interests in the securitized receivables and  therefore  we have a financial interest in and exposure to the performance of the securitized receivables

the increase in interchange income in the years ended december  and was primarily due to higher purchase volume related to the increase in average managed business credit card accounts and receivables 
the average interchange rate was in the year ended december   in the year ended december  and in the year ended december  increases in business credit card rewards in the years ended december  and  were due to the increase in average managed business credit card accounts in the rewards programs and the corresponding purchase activity in those accounts  partially offset by a change in estimate in in  we revised our estimate of the bonus mile reward liability  including a change in the assumed percentage of cardholders that will ultimately claim rewards from to and a change in the estimated cost of future reward redemptions  based on experience for that program life to date 
the impact of the change in estimate of the bonus mile reward liability was an approximate million increase in other revenues in the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate that this change in estimate will have a favorable impact on results of operations in future periods  depending on the levels of bonus mile rewards earned by cardholders in those periods 
increases in cash advance fees in the years ended december  and are due to growth in managed business credit card accounts 
in  our marketing campaigns have included a broader array of competitively priced offerings and products  including balance transfer promotions  promotional pricing and rewards programs  geared specifically toward attracting more higher credit quality customers

on january   the trial court issued a decision ruling on all but one of the issues that were to be determined at trial  and ordered further briefing on the remaining outstanding issue 
in the year ended december   we recognized a million pretax charge representing the estimated impact of implementing the court s decisions 
this charge was classified in continuing operations as a loss on transfer of consumer credit card business  consistent with the classification of the gain on transfer of consumer credit card business of million in operating expenses year ended december  in thousands salaries and employee benefits    amortization of business credit card deferred origination costs  net    external processing    professional fees    marketing    equipment    occupancy    credit    telephone    postage    fraud loss    insurance    other    total operating expenses    salaries and employee benefits  external processing  equipment  telephone and fraud expense increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to growth in managed business credit card receivables and additional investments in initiatives to strengthen our position as a leading issuer of business credit cards to the small business market 
these included initiatives to provide additional value to our existing customers  customer retention activities  development of additional products and services  development of affinity cards and partnership relationships  and enhancement of internet capabilities for servicing our customers 
external processing expenses in also reflect a reduction in the contracted rate for these services that occurred during the first quarter of the increase in amortization of business credit card deferred origination costs  net  in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to our strategic initiative to selectively attract and retain more higher credit quality customers and the competitive environment for credit card issuers 
amortization of business credit card deferred origination costs in the year ended december  also includes a change in estimate of million 
effective july   we refined our estimate of the timing of when accounts are acquired to better match the resulting estimated period of benefit to the amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
the impact of this change in estimate in the year ended december  was a decrease in amortization of business credit card deferred origination costs of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in marketing expense in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  also resulted from our strategic initiative to selectively attract and retain more higher credit quality customers and the competitive environment for credit card issuers  partially offset by decreased origination activities in our retail note program as a result of our high liquidity position subsequent to the mortgage transaction in professional fees decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to a reduction in legal expenses related to the timing of litigation activity 
credit expense increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to growth in the volume of charged off accounts  partially offset by the shift in the types of recoveries 
there was an increase in the proportion of total recoveries collected through sales of pools of charged off accounts and a decrease in the proportion collected through outsourced individual account recovery efforts 
the decrease in insurance expense in the year ended december  as compared to is primarily a result of a decrease in fdic insurance costs on deposit liabilities 
our fdic insurance costs decreased due to the significant reduction in our outstanding deposits at advanta national bank subsequent to the mortgage transaction  and due to a decrease in the insurance assessment rate at advanta bank corp 
in addition  insurance expense in the year ended december  includes a million reduction of our estimated liability related to worker s compensation insurance 
other operating expenses in the year ended december  include a million decrease in litigation reserves resulting from a reduction of damages in a jury verdict 
see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other operating expenses in the year ended december  include a million cash rebate related to prior periods business credit card processing costs 
salaries and employee benefits  amortization of business credit card deferred origination costs  net  external processing and fraud loss expenses increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to growth in managed business credit card receivables 
professional fees decreased by million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in professional fees was due to consulting costs incurred in associated with the implementation of our bank regulatory agreements  partially offset by increased legal costs in the decrease in marketing expenses in the year ended december  as compared to reflects decreased origination activities in our retail note program as a result of our high liquidity position subsequent to the mortgage transaction in the first quarter of other expenses in the year ended december  included an increase in litigation reserves of million 
unusual charges subsequent to our exit from the mortgage business and discontinuance of our leasing business in the first quarter of  we implemented a plan to restructure our corporate functions to a size commensurate with our ongoing businesses and incurred certain other unusual charges related to employee costs 
the restructuring activities had no significant impact on operations while they were ongoing 
due to the termination of employees and the write off of certain assets no longer used  we expected and realized lower personnel expenses in the support functions in the months following the charges  and expected to realize lower depreciation and amortization expense over the following years 
these decreases were due to the termination of employees and the write off or write down of assets previously deployed in connection with exited businesses 
we also expected and realized the elimination of the costs of the contractual commitments associated with exited business products from future operating results over the estimated timeframe of the contracts 
employee costs in the first quarter of  we recorded a million charge for severance and outplacement costs associated with the restructuring of corporate functions 
there were employees severed who were entitled to benefits 
these employees worked in corporate support functions including accounting and finance  human resources  information technology  legal and facilities management 
employees were notified in march  and severance amounts were payable over a month period following the employee s termination date 
these payments were completed in the third quarter of additionally  during  we incurred million of other employee costs 
this amount included approximately million attributable to bonuses to certain key employees in recognition of their efforts on behalf of advanta in the strategic alternatives process 
it also included approximately million of bonuses in recognition of the restructuring of the company and other significant transitional efforts 
these bonuses were paid over a month period 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a million increase in employee costs related to a revision in estimate associated with these bonuses 
in  we accelerated vesting of of outstanding options that were not vested at the date of the closing of the mortgage transaction 
this acceleration resulted in a noncash charge of million 
in connection with reviewing our compensation plans after the mortgage transaction and restructuring of corporate functions  we implemented a program whereby all outstanding stock appreciation rights and shares of phantom stock were terminated in exchange for cash to be paid through a deferred compensation arrangement 
we recorded charges of million associated with this exchange 
the charge reflects a million reduction recorded in the three months ended september   as actual cash settlement costs were less than estimated 
due to the restructuring of the company  we implemented programs whereby certain out of the money options were exchanged for shares of stock  and whereby certain shares of restricted stock were exchanged for cash and stock options in a tender offer  subject to certain performance conditions and vesting requirements 
noncash charges associated with the issuance of the stock  stock options and the tender offer totaled million 
this charge reflects a million increase recorded in the three months ended september   as actual noncash charges associated with the tender offer were more than estimated 
expenses associated with exited businesses products in the first quarter of  we recorded charges of million related to other products exited for which no future revenues or benefits would be received 
in the third quarter of  we were able to settle some of these commitments for less than originally estimated  and reduced the charge by million 
we paid the remaining costs  which included lease and other commitments  in the third quarter of in  in connection with the transfer of our consumer credit card business to fleet credit card llc  we made major organizational changes to reduce corporate expenses incurred in the past to support the business contributed to fleet credit card llc in the transfer of our consumer credit card business  and associated with the business and products no longer being offered or not directly associated with our mortgage  business credit card and leasing units 
as of december   the remaining accrual related to charges associated with these organizational changes was million 
this accrual related to contractual commitments to certain customers  and non related financial institutions that were providing benefits to those customers  under a product that was no longer offered and for which no future revenues or benefits would be received 
a third party assumed the liabilities associated with these commitments in the first quarter of  and we recorded an additional charge relating to the settlement of these commitments of million 
asset impairments in connection with our plan to restructure our corporate functions to a size commensurate with our ongoing businesses during the first quarter of  we identified certain assets that would no longer be used  and the carrying costs of these assets were written off resulting in a charge of million 
we estimated the realizable value of these assets to be zero due to the nature of the assets  which include leasehold improvements and capitalized software 
income taxes we reported a pretax loss in the year ended december  as a result of the million charge related to the ruling in the litigation associated with the transfer of our consumer credit card business in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
since the gain on the transfer of our consumer credit card business in was not subject to income tax  the million charge in did not result in a tax benefit 
as a result  we reported income tax expense from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate  excluding the million charge  was for the year ended december  we reported a pretax loss in the year ended december  as a result of unusual charges  valuation adjustments on venture capital investments and the loss on the discontinuance of the leasing business in a valuation allowance was provided against a portion of the resulting deferred tax asset given our pre existing net operating loss carryforwards and the uncertainty of the realizability of the incremental deferred tax asset  resulting in an effective tax rate of for income from continuing operations for in the year ended december   we also reported a pretax loss and a valuation allowance was provided against the resulting deferred tax asset  resulting in a effective tax rate 
at december   net operating loss carryforwards were million  of which million expire in  million expire in  million expire in and million expire in we utilized net operating loss carryforwards of million in additionally in  million was carried back to prior years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of tax matters currently before the internal revenue service regional office of appeals 
discontinued operations in the year ended december   we recorded an after tax loss on the discontinuance of our mortgage and leasing businesses of million 
the components of this loss include a pretax charge of million for a litigation settlement related to a mortgage loan servicing agreement termination fee collected in december  a million pretax charge primarily related to an increase in our estimated costs of mortgage business related contingent liabilities  an million pretax gain on leasing discontinuance  and a tax benefit of million 
the million charge relates primarily to an increase in our estimated and future costs of mortgage business related contingent liabilities in connection with contingent liabilities and litigation costs arising from the operation of the mortgage business prior to the mortgage transaction that were not assumed by the buyer  and costs related to advanta s litigation with chase manhattan mortgage corporation in connection with the mortgage transaction 
the change in estimate reflects the legal and consulting fees and other costs that we expect to incur based on current levels of contingent liabilities and expense rates  and considers the status of the discovery process associated with the mortgage transaction litigation 
the million pretax gain on leasing discontinuance represents a revision in the estimated operating results of the leasing segment over the remaining life of the lease portfolio due primarily to favorable credit performance 
the leasing portfolio performed favorably as compared to the expectations and assumptions established in this improvement was the result of successfully obtaining a replacement vendor to service leased equipment for a former leasing vendor that had filed for bankruptcy protection  and operational improvements in the leasing collections area 
in the year ended december   we recorded an after tax loss on the discontinuance of our mortgage and leasing businesses of million 
the components of this net loss include a pretax gain on the mortgage transaction of million  a pretax loss on the discontinuance of our leasing business of million  and a tax provision of million 
the gain on the mortgage transaction does not reflect any impact from the post closing adjustment process that has not yet been completed due to litigation related to the mortgage transaction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the million pretax loss on the discontinuance of the leasing business in was due to a change in estimate of the operating results of the leasing segment over the remaining life of the lease portfolio 
the change in estimate was needed due to an increase in estimated credit losses expected throughout the remaining term of the leasing portfolio based on credit loss experience in a principal factor contributing to the increased credit losses in was that one of our former leasing vendors had filed for bankruptcy protection and this vendor s financial problems were impacting its ability to service the leased equipment in a segment of our leasing portfolio 
this vendor was unique from our other leasing vendors in that it had a significant servicing relationship with our customers and the equipment under lease provided fee revenue to our customers for usage 
also  our contract with the vendor provided that the vendor would provide a guaranty if the performance of the leases did not meet certain criteria 
this guaranty was considered when underwriting the leases 
we recorded a loss on the discontinuance of our leasing business of million  net of tax  effective december   representing the estimated operating results through the remaining term of the leasing portfolio 
estimated operating results of the leasing business included estimated valuations of retained interests in leasing securitizations  estimated cash flows from on balance sheet lease receivables  interest expense and operating expenses 
loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  was million for the period from january  through february   the effective date of the mortgage transaction 
loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  was million in the year ended december  loss from discontinued operations in the year ended december  includes charges which were made in response to our regulatory review process  including the implementation of the agreements with the bank regulators that were signed during the second and third quarters of  and changes during the second quarter in the market and the political and regulatory environment for subprime lending 
these charges included a pretax reduction in the valuation of advanta national bank s retained interests in mortgage securitizations of million and an increase in advanta national bank s on balance sheet allowance for receivable losses related to mortgage loans of million 
these advanta national bank charges reduced net income by million or per combined common diluted share 
in addition  loss from discontinued operations in the year ended december  includes million of pretax charges resulting from changes in valuation assumptions related to retained interests in leasing securitizations  primarily due to higher credit losses associated with certain unprofitable segments of broker originations from prior periods 
these charges reduced net income by million or per combined common diluted share 
loss from discontinued operations in the year ended december  also includes million of revenues related to termination fees received under a mortgage servicing agreement 
asset liability management we manage our financial condition with a focus on maintaining high credit quality standards  disciplined management of market risks and prudent levels of growth  leverage and liquidity 
market risk sensitivity market risk is the potential for loss or diminished financial performance arising from adverse changes in market forces including interest rates and market prices 
market risk sensitivity is the degree to which a financial instrument  or a company that owns financial instruments  is exposed to market forces 
fluctuations in interest rates  changes in economic conditions  shifts in customer behavior  and other factors can affect our financial performance 
changes in economic conditions and shifts in customer behavior are difficult to predict  and our financial performance generally cannot be insulated from these forces 
we are exposed to equity price risk on the equity securities in our investments available for sale portfolio 
a significant portion of our equity securities at december  represented venture capital investments 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the market exposure on equity investments 
a adverse change in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our equity investments as of december  a adverse change would have resulted in an approximate million decrease in fair value as of december  financial performance variability as a result of fluctuations in interest rates is commonly called interest rate risk 
interest rate risk generally results from mismatches in the timing of asset and liability repricing gap risk and from differences between the repricing indices of assets and liabilities basis risk 
we regularly evaluate our market risk profile and attempt to minimize the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income  securitization income and net income 
in managing interest rate risk exposure  we may periodically securitize receivables  sell and purchase assets  alter the mix and term structure of our funding base  change our investment portfolio  or use derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are not used for trading or speculative activities 
there were no interest rate swaps or other derivatives outstanding related to continuing operations at december  or risk exposure levels vary continuously  as changes occur in our asset liability mix  market interest rates and other factors affecting the timing and magnitude of cash flows 
we attempt to analyze the impact of interest rate risk by regularly evaluating the perceived risks inherent in our asset and liability structure  including derivative instruments  if applicable 
computer simulations are used to generate expected financial performance in a variety of interest rate environments 
those results are analyzed to determine if actions need to be taken to mitigate our interest rate risk 
we measure our interest rate risk using a rising rate scenario and a declining rate scenario 
net interest income is estimated using a third party software model that uses standard income modeling techniques 
we also measure the effect of interest rate risk on our managed net interest income  which includes net interest income on owned assets and net interest income on securitized receivables 
the measurement of managed net interest income in addition to net interest income on owned assets is meaningful because our securitization income fluctuates with yields on securitized receivables and interest rates earned by note holders 
both increasing and decreasing rate scenarios assume an instantaneous shift in rates and measure the corresponding change in expected net interest income as compared to a base case scenario 
as of december  and  we estimated that our owned net interest income and managed net interest income would change as follows over a twelve month period estimated percentage increase decrease in owned net interest income assuming basis point increase in interest rates assuming basis point decrease in interest rates estimated percentage increase decrease in managed net interest income assuming basis point increase in interest rates assuming basis point decrease in interest rates our owned and securitized business credit card receivables include interest rate floors that cause our managed net interest income to rise in the declining rate scenario 
our managed net interest income decreases in a rising rate scenario due to the portion of the business credit card portfolio that is effectively at a fixed rate because of the nature of the pricing of the accounts and the variable rate funding of off balance sheet securitized receivables 
changes in the composition of our balance sheet  the current interest rate environment at december  as compared to december   and a reset of interest rate floors on a significant portion of our business credit cards portfolio during have also impacted the results of the owned and managed net interest income sensitivity analyses 
the above estimates of net interest income sensitivity alone do not provide a comprehensive view of our exposure to interest rate risk 
the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters and assumptions utilized in generating the results 
these analyses are useful only when viewed within the context of the parameters and assumptions used 
the above rate scenarios in no way reflect management s expectation regarding the future direction of interest rates  and they depict only two possibilities out of a large set of possible scenarios 
liquidity and capital resources our goal is to maintain an adequate level of liquidity  for both long term and short term needs  through active management of both assets and liabilities 
since advanta corp 
s debt rating is not investment grade  our access to unsecured  institutional debt is limited 
however  we do have access to a diversity of funding sources as described below  and had a high level of liquidity at december  at december   we had million of federal funds sold  million of receivables held for sale  and million of investments  which could be sold to generate additional liquidity 
components of funding were as follows at december in thousands amount amount off balance sheet securitized receivables   deposits   debt and other borrowings   capital securities   equity   total   includes both off balance sheet business credit card receivables and off balance sheet lease receivables related to discontinued operations 
excludes our ownership interest in the investor principal balance of securitizations subordinated trust assets that are held on balance sheet and classified as retained interests in securitizations or assets of discontinued operations 
at december   our ratio of equity  including capital securities  to on balance sheet assets was as compared to at december  in managing our capital needs  we also consider our ratio of equity to managed assets  since our on balance sheet assets include retained interests in securitizations that serve as credit enhancement to the investors interests in the securitized receivables 
the ratio of equity  including capital securities  to managed assets was at december  as compared to at december  we calculate managed assets as follows december  in thousands total on balance sheet assets   off balance sheet securitized receivables   managed assets   off balance sheet securitizations as shown in the components of funding table above  off balance sheet securitizations provide a significant portion of our funding and they are one of our primary sources of liquidity 
these transactions enable us to limit our credit risk in the securitized receivables to the amount of interests retained on balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for key securitization data including income  cash flows and assumptions used in measuring the fair value of our retained interests in securitizations 
our accounting policies related to securitization transactions are discussed in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we completed one public business credit card securitization in each of and  and our first two public business credit card securitizations in these public securitizations enabled us to grow off balance sheet business credit card receivables as a component of our funding 
in addition to the public securitizations  the securitization trust has two non public series outstanding 
the first series  series a  provides off balance sheet funding through a million committed commercial paper conduit facility  through which million of business credit card receivables were securitized at december  the commitment can be withdrawn under certain conditions  similar to the conditions for an early amortization event  as described below  for the other series of the securitization trust 
our commercial paper conduit facility also requires the servicer  advanta bank corp  to meet its minimum regulatory capital requirements 
upon the expiration of million of this commercial paper conduit facility in march and the remainder of million in june  management expects to obtain the appropriate level of replacement funding under similar terms and conditions 
the second non public series was a securitization completed in the revolving periods for each series of the business credit card securitization trust extend to the following dates in thousands investor principal balance at scheduled end of december  revolving period series a  june series a  january series b  march series c  january series a  july series a  september in addition to investor principal balance  our securitized business credit card receivables include billed interest and fees of million on those accounts at december  when the revolving periods of the series end and they start their expected amortization periods  we will need to replace the funding currently being provided by those series 
we expect the million series a to complete its amortization period by april and the million series b to complete its amortization period by july management expects to replace this funding through a combination of increased deposits and private and public securitization transactions under similar terms and conditions as our current private and public securitizations 
however  based on recent trends in market rates for asset backed securities issued by certain other credit card companies and our recent experience  we expect the costs of our public securitization transactions in will be higher than what we experienced in the securitization agreements contain conditions that would trigger an early amortization event 
an early amortization event would result in the end of the revolving period prior to the expected dates above  which would require us to find an alternate means of funding new receivables generated on existing business credit card accounts 
the conditions include the failure to make payments under the terms of the agreement  or the insolvency or other similar event of advanta bank corp 
an early amortization event would also be triggered for each individual series if the three month average excess spread percentage was not maintained at a level greater than for that series 
excess spread represents income related cash flows on securitized receivables interest  interchange and fees net of note holders interest  servicing fees  and credit losses 
at december   our three month average excess spread was 
based on the current levels of excess spread  our financial condition and other considerations  management believes that it is unlikely that the trust or any individual series will have an early amortization event 
the business credit card securitization agreements do not have any provisions or conditions involving the debt rating of advanta corp 
deposits  debt  other borrowings and equity in the first quarter of  we received in excess of billion in cash proceeds from the mortgage transaction that resulted in liquidity in excess of the needs of our continuing businesses 
we strategically used the proceeds to strengthen advanta for the future  including a significant reduction in our leverage 
in the second quarter of  we sold million of our deposit liabilities to e trade bank  a wholly owned subsidiary of e trade group  inc we also paid off substantially all of our outstanding medium term notes and reduced our outstanding retail notes 
in the year ended december   we reduced debt and deposits by billion 
also  advanta national bank suspended originations of deposit accounts 
excess liquid assets were held in short term  high quality investments earning money market rates until they could be deployed 
as a result  we had interest expense in excess of interest income on this excess liquidity that was not included in advanta business cards or venture capital segment results 
we do not anticipate that we will incur net interest expense unrelated to the funding of our advanta business cards or venture capital segments in the year ended december  since the excess liquid assets described above have been deployed as of december  we continue to offer unsecured debt securities of advanta corp  in the form of redireserve certificates and investment notes  to retail investors through our retail note program 
we change the interest rates we offer frequently  depending on market conditions and our funding needs 
the rates also vary depending on the size of each investment 
at december   million of redireserve certificates and investment notes were outstanding with interest rates ranging from to 
in the first quarter of  after consideration of the parent liquidity and the capital requirements for the ongoing business  the board of directors of advanta corp 
authorized management to purchase up to million shares of advanta corp 
common stock or the equivalent dollar amount of our capital securities  or some combination thereof 
in august  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional million shares of advanta corp 
common stock  bringing the total authorization to up to million shares 
we intend to continue to make purchases modestly and when we believe it is prudent to do so while we analyze evolving capital requirements 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our class b common stock 
in the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our class b common stock 
advanta corp 
and its subsidiaries are involved in class action lawsuits  other litigation  claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or discontinued operations  including litigation arising from our operation of the mortgage business prior to the mortgage transaction in the first quarter of management believes that the aggregate loss  if any  resulting from existing litigation  claims and other legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or capital resources based on our current expectations regarding the ultimate resolutions of these actions and amounts held in escrow in connection with certain litigation 
however  due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and since the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings are influenced by factors outside of our control  it is reasonably possible that the estimated cash flow related to these proceedings may change or that actual results will differ from our estimates 
the following tables detail the composition of the deposit base and the composition of debt and other borrowings at year end for each of the past five years 
composition of deposit base in millions as of december  amount amount amount amount amount demand deposits money market savings time deposits of  or less   time deposits of more than total deposits    composition of debt and other borrowings in millions as of december  amount amount amount amount amount subordinated retail notes and certificates senior retail notes and certificates medium term bank notes medium term notes value notes term fed funds  fed funds purchased and fhlb advances securities sold under agreements to repurchase other borrowings total debt and other borrowings   contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december  by period 
the table does not include purchase obligations  representing agreements with minimum or fixed terms to purchase goods or services in the ordinary course of business 
we expect that purchase obligations will be funded with operating cash flows and that they will not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
in thousands payments due by period less than or equal to after total year years years years time deposits    debt and other borrowings     operating leases    total     management expects to fund our deposit and debt obligations with replacement deposits or debt having similar terms and conditions 
we expect to fund commitments related to operating leases with operating cash flows 
in addition to these obligations  we have commitments to extend credit to our business credit card customers  representing unused lines of credit  of billion at december  and billion at december  lines of credit on our customers business credit cards totaled billion at december  and billion at december  we believe that our customers utilization of their lines of credit will continue to be substantially less than the amount of the commitments  as has been our experience to date 
we expect to fund the commitments to extend credit with the various components of funding described above  similar to the funding of other new receivables 
regulatory agreements and restrictions at subsidiaries advanta bank corp 
and advanta national bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements and other regulatory provisions that restrict their ability to lend and or pay dividends to advanta corp 
and its affiliates 
our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to certain capital and dividend rules and regulations as prescribed by state jurisdictions in which they are authorized to operate 
see part i government regulation 
in  advanta bank corp 
entered into agreements with its bank regulatory agencies  primarily relating to the bank s subprime lending operations 
these agreements imposed temporary deposit growth limits at advanta bank corp 
and required prior regulatory approval of cash dividends 
in april  the agreements were removed and  as a result  the restrictions in the agreements on deposit growth and payment of cash dividends are no longer applicable 
in connection with removing the agreements  advanta bank corp 
reached an understanding with its regulators  reflecting continued progress in our ongoing efforts to enhance advanta bank corp 
s practices and procedures 
effective october  the understanding was revised 
the revised understanding replaces the provisions of the prior understanding and provides for the bank to enhance certain of its internal planning and monitoring processes 
the revised understanding is consistent with the manner in which advanta bank corp 
is currently operating its business and includes no restrictions expected to have any impact on our financial results 
in  advanta national bank also reached agreements with its bank regulatory agency  primarily relating to the bank s subprime lending operations 
the agreements established temporary asset growth limits at advanta national bank  imposed restrictions on taking brokered deposits and required that advanta national bank maintain certain capital ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory standards 
in  advanta national bank entered into an additional agreement with its regulatory agency regarding restrictions on new business activities and product lines at advanta national bank after the mortgage transaction  and the resolution of outstanding advanta national bank liabilities 
the agreement also reduced the capital requirements for advanta national bank to for tier and total capital to risk weighted assets  and to for tier capital to adjusted total assets as defined in the agreement 
in addition  the agreement prohibits the payment of dividends by advanta national bank without prior regulatory approval 
management believes that advanta national bank was in compliance with its regulatory agreements at december  at december   advanta bank corp 
s combined total capital ratio combined tier i and tier ii capital was  and advanta national bank s combined total capital ratio was 
at december   advanta bank corp 
s combined total capital ratio was  and advanta national bank s combined total capital ratio was 
in each case  advanta bank corp 
and advanta national bank had capital at levels a bank is required to maintain to be classified as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
however  advanta national bank does not meet the definition of well capitalized because of the existence of its agreement with its regulatory agency  even though it has achieved the higher imposed capital ratios required by the agreement 
total stockholders equity of our banking and insurance affiliates was million at december   of which million was restricted 
at january   million of stockholders equity of our bank and insurance affiliates was available for payment of cash dividends in under applicable regulatory guidelines without prior regulatory approval 
in addition to dividend restrictions at banking subsidiaries  certain non bank subsidiaries are subject to minimum equity requirements as part of securitization or other agreements 
the total minimum equity requirement of non bank subsidiaries was million at december  at december   the non bank subsidiaries were in compliance with these minimum equity requirements 
management believes that the restrictions  for both bank and non bank subsidiaries  will not have an adverse effect on advanta corp 
s ability to meet its cash obligations due to the current levels of liquidity and diversity of funding sources
