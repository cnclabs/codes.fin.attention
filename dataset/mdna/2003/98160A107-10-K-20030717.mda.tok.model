as of april   one kfc freestanding restaurant was closed for a major remodel 
the company has also continued its facilities upgrade program for its kfc locations and has completed two tear down and rebuilds that include face to face drive through window operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of asset  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to its most critical accounting policies  on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers a history of operating losses to be its primary indicator of potential impairment 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level  typically the restaurant level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the company deems an asset to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted projected future operating cash flows directly related to the asset  including disposal value  if any  is less than its carrying amount 
projected future operating cashflows are based on budgeted future operating results and forecast estimates 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate projected future operating cashflows 
accordingly  if actual results fall short of such estimates  significant future impairments could result 
goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized  estimated useful lives range from to years 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
sfas no 
requires a two step process for testing impairment 
first  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists 
if an impairment is indicated  then the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the unit s fair value to its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the amount of impairment for goodwill and other intangible assets is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
the company has established its reporting units based on its current reporting structure and all recognized assets  liabilities and goodwill have been assigned to these reporting units 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair market value 
accordingly  actual results could vary from such estimates 
income taxes at april   the book value of the company s deferred income tax assets  prior to considering any valuation allowance  was approximately million  of which approximately million was domestic 
the principal component of the domestic deferred income tax assets was comprised of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  require a valuation allowance when in management s judgment  based upon currently available information and other factors  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
the company bases its determination of the need for a valuation allowance on an on going evaluation of current information including  among other things  estimates of future earnings in different tax jurisdictions and the expected timing of deferred income tax asset reversals 
a charge or credit to income tax expense is made for any adjustments to the valuation allowance in the period in which these determinations are made 
during the year ended april   the valuation allowance was reduced by 
table of contents approximately million  which consisted of million of utilization of net operating losses and a million adjustment related to the company s estimate of the future realization of deferred income tax assets 
at april   the company s valuation allowance against its domestic deferred income tax assets was approximately million  which is net of these reductions 
the company believes that the determination to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is based on an estimate of future taxable income in the united states  which is susceptible to change and may or may not occur  and because the impact of adjusting a valuation allowance may be material 
self insurance the company self insures a significant portion of its workers compensation  general liability and health insurance plans 
the full extent of certain claims  in many cases  may not become fully determined for several years 
the company  therefore  estimates the potential obligation for liabilities which have been incurred but not yet reported based upon historical data and experience  and utilizes an outside consulting firm to assist the company in developing these estimates 
although management believes that the amounts accrued for these obligations are sufficient  any significant increase in either the number of claims and or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
supplemental executive retirement plan the company terminated its supplemental executive retirement plan serp but continues to remain obligated under the serp for former employees 
the company accounts for the serp under sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions 
the company makes significant assumptions used in determining the net pension cost and benefit obligation 
significant assumptions used include discount rates and mortality estimates  which are determined with the assistance of an outside consulting firm 
although management believes that the amounts accrued for these benefit obligations are sufficient  any changes in these assumptions could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
market and operating partnerships during fiscal year  pat oscar s began offering equity interests to its regional and restaurant management each participant  an equity partner 
this equity plan was established to promote a responsibility of ownership among its key managers and enhance the development  operation and performance of pat oscar s 
each equity partner  generally a regional market manager or a restaurant general manager  is allowed to purchase an ownership interest in a limited liability company that operates and owns or leases substantially all of the restaurant assets from pat oscar s 
the ownership interest purchased by the equity partner is based on fair market value and ranges from percent to percent of the partnership  which includes only the restaurants that the equity partner oversees 
the equity partner is restricted from selling the ownership interest for an initial period of five years 
at the end of the initial term the equity partner has the option to continue operating on a month to month basis  renew the agreement for another five years and purchase an additional to percent interest or sell their interest to pat oscar s at the then prevailing fair market value 
fair market value will be determined in accordance with reasonable and consistent valuation methods and procedures and will consider among other things such factors as the restaurant s remaining lease life  historic profitability and continued profitability of the restaurant s 
the price paid by pat oscar s to repurchase the ownership interest  at the option of the equity partner  subject to the company s approval  may be made either in the form of a note  the company s common stock or percent cash and percent company common stock 
there is no public market for these interests  therefore the fair value determinations are subjective and require the use of estimates for which significant judgments are required 
periodically  the company may engage outside experts to assess the reasonableness of the methodology the company uses to estimate fair value

the provision for income taxes has been computed based on management s estimate of the annual effective income tax rate applied to income before taxes and was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  an increase of million 
the increase is due to higher income from the company s international division  which does not benefit from net operating loss deductions  and to recently enacted legislation in california that delays the company s ability to utilize net operating losses in the state of california for two years 
during fiscal year  the company reduced its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by million to recognize net operating loss carryforwards the company believes are more likely than not to be realized

australian management options under the company s stock option plan for its australian management group amg  certain amg employees were granted options to purchase million shares representing a percent interest in collins food group cfg  the company s australian subsidiary 
the exercise price of the options  australian us at april   equaled the estimated fair value of the shares on the grant date 
in addition  participants who remain employees of cfg for the three years ending august   are entitled to their share of a retention bonus aggregating million australian  which can only be applied to the exercise price of the options 
such amount is being expensed over the related three year period 
in addition  under the terms of the plan  for the one year period ended august   the amg participants earned options to purchase  additional shares of cfg at the fair market value as of august  these shares represent a percent interest in cfg and the company expects a third party valuation of the fair value of these options will be completed in the first quarter of fiscal year on august   the amg may be granted further options representing percent of the outstanding shares of cfg subject to the achievement of certain specified profitability targets 
all of the options become  and remain exercisable for a period of one year commencing august  and become immediately exercisable in the event of a change in control of cfg 
based on the operating results of cfg  the company believes that the fair market value of cfg has 
table of contents increased since the initial options were granted 
this increase in the fair market value of the cfg options is considered in the computation of earnings per share and the dilutive effect of the cfg options has been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
see note earnings per share  to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  the dilutive effect of the outstanding options has not been material and the company expects that starting in fiscal year  the dilutive effect of the cfg options may be up to approximately per share per quarter in future quarters and could vary depending on the value of cfg 
if the options are exercised  earnings per share could be diluted by up to percent of cfg s net income 
from august  to november   the amg may make an offer to purchase all of the company s shares of cfg 
the purchase price would be an amount determined by the amg established price per share  which the company has the right to either accept  or alternatively to purchase all shares held by the amg at the established price per share 
in the event the company proposes to sell cfg or the sizzler and kfc operations in australia to a third party before december  the amg is entitled to purchase cfg or these operations on the same terms and conditions as has been accepted by the company 
if the amg does not elect to purchase cfg or these operations  all amg members are then required to sell their shares at the same effective price per share as is accepted by the company in a sale of cfg or the sizzler and kfc operations to a third party 
in anticipation that the amg members will exercise some or all of their options on or after august   the company and the amg have initiated discussions and have reached a tentative agreement subject to a definitive written agreement that the amg will not exercise their right to purchase all of the company s shares of cfg and in return the amg may be granted additional options such that the total shares under all options will allow amg management to purchase up to a maximum of of the outstanding shares of cfg 
the tentative agreement includes a put option for the amg members to sell their amg shares back to the company at fair market value on a cumulative basis at the rate of th of the shares per year 
if all of the amg options are exercised the company would prospectively reflect a minority interest of approximately percent of the net income from its cfg operations as a reduction of consolidated net income 
the tentative agreement also provides that the amg members may sell or transfer their shares of cfg among themselves 
in addition  wrc will have the right to buy the amg shares upon termination of an amg member

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the following market risks interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  and commodity price risk 
interest rate risk the company s primary financial instrument subject to interest rate risk is a bank loan with westpac banking corporation in australia westpac 
the loan has an outstanding principal balance of million million australian dollars at april  the loan is payable in australian dollars and is collateralized by the principal operating assets  undertakings  intellectual property  unlimited cross guarantees and certain negative pledge agreements of the company s international division 
the loan bears variable interest at a rate equal to the australian inter bank borrowing rate percent at april   plus a margin of percent 
the primary exposure relating to this financial instrument results from changes in interest rates 
to hedge the company s exposure to interest rate increases on this loan  the company is party to an interest rate cap contract that prevents the company s interest rate excluding margin from exceeding percent  in which case the company would receive the difference between the contract rate and the actual interest rate 
at april   the interest rate cap covered approximately percent of the loan principal outstanding and expires on august  in addition  the company is party to an interest rate swap contract to convert part of its variable interest exposure to a fixed rate of percent excluding margin 
at april   the interest rate swap contract covered approximately percent of the loan principal outstanding and expires on august  the company also has a revolving credit facility and a term loan in the amount of million with variable interest as a result of the acquisition of pat oscar s 
the interest rates ranged from to percent during fiscal year the company calculated that a hypothetical percent change in the interest rates  as defined above  in the near term would not have material impact on the company s results of operations 
the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated fair value of long term debt exposure as of april  are as follows in thousands carrying amount fair value non collateralized borrowings  at fixed and variable interest rates at april   due through collateralized borrowings  at variable interest rates at april   due through ge capital collateralized borrowings  with fixed interest rates ranging from to due through mortgage notes payable  with a fixed interest rate of collateralized by land and building with an original cost of approximately due through westpac note  with a variable interest rate at april  payable in australian dollars due through capital lease obligations the company s carrying value of fixed rate long term debt and variable rate debt approximated fair value at april  
table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk the company s foreign currency exchange risk primarily relates to its investment in its australian operations whereby changes in the exchange rate impact the company s net investment 
the company has mitigated the risk with a bank loan payable in australian dollars  which reduces the company s exposure by decreasing its net investment 
as of april   the company s net deficit in its australian subsidiaries was million 
the company does not enter into contracts designed to hedge the residual foreign currency exchange risk 
the company calculated that a hypothetical percent increase in the exchange rate in the near term would result in approximately a million increase in the net deficit in the australia subsidiaries 
commodity price risk the company s commodity price risk is attributable to fluctuations in the price of selected food products such as meat  poultry and produce used in the normal course of business 
the company contracts for certain amounts of these food products in the future at a predetermined or fixed price in order to hedge the risk of changes in the market price 
the company does not purchase futures contracts for trading purposes 
the company is unable to predict the possible impact of changes in commodity prices 
however  in the past the company has been able to address these changes by passing these costs along to its customers because these changes have generally impacted all restaurant companies
