in november  sprint s shareholders approved the allocation of all of sprint s assets and liabilities into two groups  the fon group and the pcs group  as well as the creation of the fon stock and the pcs stock 
in addition  sprint purchased the remaining ownership interests in sprint spectrum holding company  lp and phillieco  lp together  sprint pcs  other than a minority interest in cox communications pcs  lp cox pcs  which is now called sprint telephony pcs  lp sprint acquired these ownership interests from tele communications  inc  comcast corporation and cox communications  inc 
the cable partners 
in exchange  sprint issued the cable partners special low vote pcs shares and warrants to acquire additional pcs shares 
sprint also issued the cable partners shares of a new series of preferred stock convertible into pcs shares 
the purchase of the cable partners interests is referred to as the pcs restructuring 
in the second quarter  cox communications  inc exercised a put option requiring sprint to purchase the remaining interest in cox pcs 
sprint issued additional low vote pcs shares in exchange for this interest 
also in november  sprint reclassified each of its publicly traded common shares into one share of fon stock and share of pcs stock 
this recapitalization was tax free to shareholders 
in addition  the class a common shares owned by ft and dt were reclassified into shares representing both fon stock and pcs stock 
these transactions are referred to as the recapitalization 
in connection with the pcs restructuring  ft and dt purchased million additional pcs shares pre split basis 
ft no longer holds fon shares  and dt no longer holds either fon or pcs shares 
operating segments sprint s business is divided into three lines of business the global markets division  the local division  and the pcs wireless telephony products and services business 
board discretion regarding tracking stocks fon common stock and pcs common stock are intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the fon and pcs groups 
however  they are classes of common stock of sprint  not of the group they are intended to track 
accordingly  fon and pcs shareholders are subject to the risks related to an equity investment in sprint and all of sprint s businesses  assets and liabilities 
shares of fon common stock and pcs common stock do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to either group  but rather represent a direct equity interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole 
sprint s board of directors has the discretion to  among other things  make operating and financial decisions that could favor one group over the other and  subject to the restrictions in sprint s articles of incorporation  to change the allocation of the assets and liabilities that comprise each of the fon group and the pcs group without stockholder approval 
under the applicable corporate law  sprint s board owes its fiduciary duties to all of sprint s shareholders and there is no board of directors that owes separate duties to the holders of either the fon common stock or the pcs common stock 
the tracking stock policies provide that the board  in resolving material matters in which the holders of fon common stock and pcs common stock have potentially divergent interests  will act in the best interests of sprint and all of its common shareholders after giving fair consideration to the potentially divergent interests of the holders of the separate classes of sprint common stock 
these policies may be changed by the board without shareholder approval 
given the board s discretion in these matters  it may be difficult to assess the future prospects of each group based on past performance 
critical accounting policies the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend the business activities of sprint 
to aid in that understanding  management has identified sprint s critical accounting policies 
these policies are considered critical because they have the potential to have a material impact on sprint s financial statements  and because they require judgements and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 

long lived asset recovery a significant portion of sprint s total assets consist of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment pp e and definite life intangibles  as well as goodwill and indefinite life intangibles 
changes in technology or in sprint s intended use of these assets  as well as changes in broad economic or industry factors  may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
depreciable lives of assets sprint performs annual internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for each category of pp e 
these studies utilize models  which take into account actual usage  physical wear and tear  replacement history  and assumptions about technology evolution  and use in certain instances actuarially determined probabilities to calculate remaining life of our asset base 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to the establishment of asset depreciable lives is a critical accounting estimate because it requires company management to make assumptions about technology evolution and competitive uses of assets  and the impact of changes in these assumptions could be material to our financial position  as well as our results of operations 
management s assumptions about technology and its future development require significant judgement because the timing and impacts of technology advances are difficult to predict  and actual experience has varied from previous assumptions and could continue to do so 
if sprint s studies had resulted in a depreciable rate that was higher or lower than those used in the preparation of sprint s consolidated financial statements  recorded depreciation expense would have been impacted by approximately million 
the impact to fon group depreciation expense would be approximately million and the impact to pcs group depreciation expense would be approximately million 
property  plant and equipment and definite life intangibles impairment pp e and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that if an impairment indicator is present  the company must assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is unrecoverable by estimating the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from the asset  undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the carrying amount is less than the recoverable amount  an impairment charge must be recognized  based on the fair value of the asset 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it requires company management to make assumptions about future revenues and costs of sales over the life of the asset  and the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material to our financial position  as well as our results of operations 
management s assumptions about future revenues require significant judgement because actual revenues have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so 
in estimating future revenues  we use our internal business forecasts 
we develop our forecasts based on recent revenue data for existing products and services  planned timing of new products and services  and other industry and economic factors 
when indicators are present  sprint tests for impairment 
in  this resulted in a total of million of pp e being impaired 
fon group recorded million for network asset impairments and pcs group recorded million for abandoned network projects 
these impairments represent less than one percent of the december  consolidated net pp e for sprint 
goodwill and indefinite life intangibles goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are reviewed at least annually for impairment  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill is tested by comparing net book value of the reporting unit identified as sprint s operating segments to fair value 
indefinite life intangibles are tested by comparing book value to estimated fair value 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to goodwill and indefinite life intangibles is a critical accounting estimate because it requires company management to make assumptions about fair values  and the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material to our financial position  as well as our results of operations 
management s assumptions about fair values require significant judgement because broad economic factors  industry factors and technology considerations can result in variable and volatile fair values 
management completed impairment analyses on both goodwill and indefinite life intangibles in the fourth quarter of these tests were performed internally and  in the case of certain intangibles  by a third party valuation appraisal company 
in each instance  as of december   no impairment existed 

employee benefit plan assumptions retirement benefits are a significant cost of doing business for sprint and yet represent obligations that will be settled far in the future 
retirement benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of the future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by the company 
the accounting requires that management make assumptions regarding such variables as the return on assets  the discount rate and future health care costs 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligation and periodic benefit cost incurred by the company 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to retirement benefit accounting is a critical accounting estimate because it requires company management to make assumptions about discount rates  future health care costs  and future return on assets funding the obligation  and the impact of changes in actual performance versus these estimates would have on the projected benefit obligation reported on our balance sheet and the benefit cost could be material 
the method of determining pension obligations requires assumptions concerning market performance 
market performance has fluctuated in the recent past and could have continued volatility in the future 
in selecting these assumptions  sprint uses historical experience as well as objective indices as benchmarks  and tests the benchmarks against historical industry data on these assumptions provided by an independent actuary 
an increase in the discount rate or in the expected return on assets would reduce the reported obligation 
in contrast  if the discount rate in used in determining this obligation was basis points lower  it would generate a million increase in the obligation reported on the balance sheet  and a million increase in the benefit costs 
similarly  if the expected return on assets assumption was basis points lower  it would generate a million increase in the obligation reported on the balance sheet  and a similar increase to benefit costs 
reasonable changes in the estimate of health care cost assumptions would not materially affect the obligation or related benefit costs for a single year 

allocation policies between tracking stocks as discussed previously  the fon common stock is intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the fon group and the pcs common stock is intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the pcs group 
the fon common stock and the pcs common stock are both classes of the common stock of sprint  and together  the groups reflect of sprint s business activities 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to allocation policies is a critical accounting estimate because it requires company management to make assumptions about market interest rates and group use of shared costs  and the impact that recognizing a change in this allocation would have on the net assets  use of resources or operating results of either group could be material 
allocation policies regarding shared activities impact the business results of the fon group and the pcs group 
sprint performs internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of assignment of costs when direct assignment is not possible or practical 
the methods used for indirect assignment include time studies  and factors related to marketing or headcount studies 
sprint manages the financing activities of the groups on a centralized basis 
debt incurred by sprint on behalf of the groups is specifically allocated to and reflected in the financial statements of the applicable group 
interest expense is assigned to the pcs group based on an estimated rate that is substantially equal to the rate it would be able to obtain from third parties as a direct or indirect wholly owned sprint subsidiary  but without the benefit of any guarantee by sprint or any member of the fon group 
additionally  sprint s centralized cash management program allows one group to advance funds to the other group 
these advances are accounted for as short term borrowings between the groups and bear interest at a rate that is substantially equal to the rate that group would be able to obtain from third parties on a short term basis 
management utilizes credit rating agencies and investment banks to provide an objective basis for determining appropriate assumptions concerning market interest rates 
sprint uses this information in arriving at the assumptions used to determine our allocations 
the allocation of assets  financial resources and certain expenses require judgement by management and the allocation methods used are subject to the discretion of the board of directors in its fulfillment of its fiduciary duties to all of sprint s shareholders 
holders of fon stock and pcs stock may have interests that differ from or conflict with the interests of holders of the other stock 
our tracking stock policies provide that our board of directors  in resolving material matters in which holders of fon stock and pcs stock have potentially divergent interests  will act in the best interest of sprint and all of its common stockholders after giving fair consideration to the potentially divergent interests of the holders of the separate classes of common stock 

tax valuation allowances sprint is required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in its financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process requires sprint s management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact 
sprint records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizable future tax benefits 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law  significant changes in the jurisdictions in which sprint operates  sprint s inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year s liability by taxing authorities 
these changes can have a significant impact on the financial position of the company 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to establishing tax valuation allowances is a critical accounting estimate because it requires company management to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities  and the impact changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefit as reported in our results of operations could be material 
management s assumptions require significant judgement because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so 
sprint currently carries an income tax valuation allowance of million on its books 
this amount includes a valuation allowance for the total tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards which were acquired in connection with certain acquisitions 
the remainder of the valuation allowance relates to state net operating loss carryforwards 
assumption changes which result in a reduction of expected benefits from realization of state net operating loss carryforwards by would increase our valuation allowance by million for pcs group and million for fon group 

revenue recognition policies sprint recognizes operating revenues as services are rendered or as products are delivered to customers in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
in connection with recording revenue  estimates and assumptions are required in determining the expected conversion of the revenue streams to cash collected 
the revenue estimation process requires management to make assumptions based on historical results  future expectations  the economic and competitive environment  changes in the credit worthiness of our customers  and other relevant factors 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the projection of cash collected and the periodic revenue stream recognized by the company 
sprint believes that the accounting estimate related to the establishment of revenue and receivable reserves and the associated provisions in the results of operations is a critical accounting estimate because it requires company management to make assumptions about future billing adjustments for disputes with customers  unauthorized usage  future returns on asset sales and future access adjustments for disputes with competitive local exchange carriers and inter exchange carriers  as well as the future economic viability of our customer base  and the impact of changes in actual performance versus these estimates would have on the accounts receivable reported on our balance sheet and the results reported in our statements of operations could be material 
in selecting these assumptions  sprint uses historical trending of write offs  industry norms  regulatory decisions and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions which might impact the collectibility of accounts

general overview of the sprint pcs group the pcs group includes sprint s wireless pcs operations 
it operates a digital pcs wireless network with licenses to provide service to the entire united states population using a single frequency and a single technology 
at year end  the pcs group  together with third party affiliates  operated pcs systems in over metropolitan markets  including the largest us metropolitan areas 
the pcs group s service  including third party affiliates  now reaches a quarter billion people 
the pcs group provides nationwide service through a combination of 
operating its own digital network in major us metropolitan areas using code division multiple access cdma  which is a digital spread spectrum wireless technology that allows a large number of users to access a single frequency band by assigning a code to all speech bits  sending a scrambled transmission of the encoded speech over the air and reassembling the speech into its original format  
affiliating with other companies that use cdma  mainly in and around smaller us metropolitan areas  
roaming on other providers analog cellular networks using multi mode and multi band handsets  and 
roaming on other providers digital networks that use cdma

these companies bear the costs of acquisition  billing and customer service 
the wireless industry  including the pcs group  typically generates a higher number of subscriber additions and handset sales in the fourth quarter of each year compared to the remaining quarters 
this is due to the use of retail distribution  which is dependent on the holiday shopping season  timing of new products and service introductions  and aggressive marketing and sales promotions 
consolidated results of operations total net operating revenues were as follows millions fon group    pcs group    intergroup eliminations net operating revenues    income loss from continuing operations was as follows millions fon group   pcs group   intergroup eliminations income loss from continuing operations  income loss from continuing operations as presented in the above table includes the after tax impacts of the charges discussed in the following paragraphs

in addition to being a sprint customer  worldcom  under various long term lease and services agreements  provides sprint access to network facilities that compose approximately of sprint s long distance fiber network and a larger percentage of network traffic 
these network facilities are also shared or utilized by worldcom 
if worldcom failed to meet its commitments under these agreements  sprint would have to pursue alternative strategies to provide this capacity that could result in delays  interruptions or additional expenses associated with the offering of our services 
sprint does not anticipate  or have indications  that worldcom does not intend to meet its commitments 
in the fourth quarter  sprint recorded a restructuring charge and asset impairment of  million representing the termination of sprint ion  as well as additional steps to reduce overall operating costs

segmental results of operations sprint s business is divided into three lines of business the global markets division  the local division  and the pcs wireless telephony products and services business 
global markets division millions net operating revenues voice    data    internet  other total net operating revenues    operating expenses costs of services and products    selling  general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    restructuring and asset impairment  total operating expenses    operating income loss  operating margin nm nm capital expenditures   the global markets division faced significant challenges in the economic downturn coupled with industry wide pricing pressures and a decline in professional services  legacy data services  and other revenues contributed to a decline in net operating revenues and an operating loss for the year 
throughout  the global markets division focused on cost management 
in  the global markets division experienced double digit reductions in cost of services and products and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
in  sprint undertook initiatives to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs 
these actions  along with an adjustment to finalize the restructuring  resulted in a million net charge to the global markets division s operations 
sprint expects revenues to be down a mid single digit rate in as the division continues to be impacted by lower wholesale results  rboc entry and re pricing of expiring contracts 
these declines are expected to be somewhat offset by business won from distressed carriers 
net operating revenues net operating revenues decreased in and in minute growth of in and in  driven in part by the increase in business minutes sold to the pcs group  was more than offset by the highly competitive pricing pressures on voice services 
the decrease in net operating revenues also reflects year over year declines in legacy data services and other services 
voice revenues voice revenues decreased in and in the decrease is a result of wireless and e mail substitution  rboc entry and business voice contract renewals occurring at lower prices 
results were also impacted by the loss of a single large low margin wholesale customer and the termination of an airline partnership 
the decrease was largely due to more competitive pricing and wireless substitution 
data revenues data revenues reflect sales of current generation data services including asynchronous transfer mode atm and frame relay services 
these revenues were flat in and increased in results in were flat due to increases in both frame relay and atm being offset by a decline in private line 
data revenues increased in due to increased sales in atm 
internet revenues internet revenues increased in and in the increase is a result of growth in dedicated ip revenues  partially offset by a decrease in dial ip revenues due to repricing of contracts  combined with strong annual growth in web hosting 
the increase was due to growth in dedicated ip  web hosting  and security 
other revenues other revenues decreased in and in the decrease is primarily due to the sale of our consulting services business  paranet  and declines in equipment sales 
the decrease reflects lower cable capacity sales  as well as declines in legacy data services and other services 
during the  and periods  cable capacity sales and sales of ownership rights to transoceanic cable represented less than   and of global market division s net operating revenues  respectively 
these transactions were executed primarily with global one  and were in accordance with our transition services agreement 
equipment sales completed in each of the periods discussed were routine in nature  were completed to support customer purchases of related telecommunications services  and represented less than   and of global market division s net operating revenues for the   and periods  respectively 
costs of services and products costs of services and products include interconnection costs paid to local phone companies  other domestic service providers and foreign phone companies to complete calls made by the division s domestic customers  costs to operate and maintain the long distance network and the ip network  and costs of equipment 
costs of services and products decreased in and increased in the decrease was a result of regulatory rate reductions  decreased network operating costs derived from sprint s fourth quarter restructuring actions  favorable carrier access settlements  as well as other cost containment efforts  partially offset by volume growth 
the increase was primarily due to a corresponding increase in call volumes  network costs of the long distance operation and costs associated with sprint ion  partially offset by lower sales of ownership rights to capacity on transoceanic cable 
the domestic rate reductions were generally due to the fcc mandated access rate reductions that took effect in july  july  and july total costs of services and products for the global markets division were of net operating revenues in  in  and in excluding sprint ion related costs  total costs of services and products for the global markets division were of net operating revenue in  in  and in selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased in and in the decrease is related to restructuring efforts and tight management of discretionary expenses 
the decrease was due to a reduction in advertising and promotion costs in both the consumer and business markets and a strong emphasis on cost control  partly offset by increased marketing and promotions of internet services and an increase in bad debt expense primarily related to wholesale customers 
the reserve for bad debts requires management s judgment and is based on customer specific indicators  as well as historical trending  industry norms and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions 
bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues was in  in  and in reserve for bad debt as a percentage of outstanding accounts receivable was in  in  and in total sg a expense for the global markets division was of net operating revenues in  in  and in excluding ion related costs  sg a expense for the global markets division was of net operating revenues in  in  and in depreciation and amortization expense estimates and assumptions are used in setting depreciable lives 
assumptions are based on internal studies of use  industry data on lives  recognition of technological advancements and understanding of business strategy 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in and in the increases are attributable to an increased asset base to meet anticipated increases in demand for voice and data related services and other growth initiatives 
depreciation and amortization expense was of net operating revenues in  in  and in excluding sprint ion related costs  depreciation and amortization expense for the global markets division was of net operating revenues in  in  and in restructuring and asset impairment in the fourth quarter  sprint recorded a net restructuring charge of million to the global markets division related to consolidations in sprints network  information technology  and billing and accounts receivable organizations as well as additional steps to reduce overall operating costs 
additionally  it recorded a network asset impairment related to the global markets division of million 
sprint recorded a net restructuring charge and asset impairment of million related to the global markets division in the third quarter 
this consisted of a million charge for the termination of high speed data services as well as additional steps to reduce operating costs 
the charge was partially offset by a million adjustment to finalize the restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter to abandon the ion initiative and restructure operations in the global markets division 
the fourth quarter actions  which resulted in a billion charge to the global markets division  were taken in an effort to better focus on enterprise data and internet services and to aggressively manage costs

local division millions net operating revenues local service    network access    long distance other total net operating revenues    operating expenses costs of services and products    selling  general and administrative    depreciation    restructuring and asset impairment total operating expenses    operating income    operating margin capital expenditures    in  the local division was impacted by the continued economic slow down  continued cable modem competition for high speed data in the consumer market  business customer data product competition in major geographic markets and wireless substitution resulting in a decline in access lines and minutes of use 
despite these pressures on revenue growth  the local division achieved improving operating results by effectively managing costs 
in the fourth quarter  sprint realigned its operations to reduce costs and increase its effectiveness 
these actions resulted in a million charge to the local division s operations 
sprint expects that wireless substitution and broadband competition will continue to adversely impact access lines and minutes of use in however  revenues and operating income are expected to be at levels consistent with beginning in july  sprint changed its transfer pricing for certain transactions between fon group entities to more accurately reflect market pricing 
the main effect of this change was a reduction in the local division s net operating revenues other revenues 
in addition  sprint s local division transferred a customer service and telemarketing organization to the pcs group at the beginning of the second quarter 
for comparative purposes  the following discussion of local division results assumes the transfer pricing change and the transfer of the customer service and telemarketing organization occurred at the beginning of adjusting for these changes  the net operating revenues would have been billion and the operating margin would have been in net operating revenues net operating revenues decreased less than in and increased in the slight decrease in was due to declines in long distance and equipment sales being partially offset by an increase in network based services 
the increase in mainly reflects increased special access revenue and increased sales of network based local services such as caller id and call waiting 
sales of network based services and long distance services increased due to strong demand for bundled services which combine local service  network based features and long distance calling 
local service revenues local service revenues  derived from local exchange services  grew in and in due to continued demand for network based services driven by the success of bundled offerings

while business recovery has been weaker than hoped for  the pcs group exited the year with a increase in net operating revenues and a billion improvement in operating income 
in the second half of  the pcs group introduced the clear pay program 
this program targeted the sub prime customer segment by eliminating a deposit requirement 
clear pay led to substantial customer growth and increased the pcs group s share of industry gross additions within its markets to the low twenty percent level in the fourth quarter of in  an increased percentage of these newly added customers failed to pay for services or engaged in fraudulent payments that led to deactivation of their accounts  and resulted in an increase in bad debt and customer churn 
to address this situation  the pcs group took several actions during the year 
in the first half of  the pcs group tightened credit screening requirements and limited the use of automated payment vehicles 
in the second half of  the pcs group initiated a deposit requirement for most clear pay customers 
these actions led to a decline in customer growth and a decline in the pcs group s share of industry gross additions within its markets to the high teen percent level 
however  the credit mix of customers began to improve in the fourth quarter of in  sprint expects the pcs group to sustain this level of industry gross additions within its markets while continuing to improve the credit mix of its customers

the pcs group assesses access charges to long distance carriers for the termination of landline originated calls 
though regulations generally entitle a carrier that terminates a call on behalf of another to be compensated for providing that service  these regulations were developed in a period where services of this nature were provided exclusively by local exchange carriers 
certain long distance carriers have disputed the pcs group s assessment of these charges as well as the corresponding rate at which the charges were determined 
in july  the fcc released a ruling affirming that nothing prohibited wireless carriers from imposing access charges for the use of their networks  however  the fcc also stated that inter exchange carriers could not be unilaterally required to pay these charges without a contractual obligation to do so 
the fcc referred the dispute back to the federal district court for the western district of missouri for a determination whether the pcs group has stated a claim under missouri state law 
at t filed a notice of appeal at the dc circuit court of appeals challenging the ruling 
in light of this ruling  the pcs group recorded an additional provision for outstanding receivables related to amounts previously billed and is fully reserved for in  the customer churn rate increased to from in and in the increase resulted primarily from company initiated churn largely associated with the deactivations of clear pay customers  as well as a slight increase in the voluntary churn rate 
recognizing the impact of increased churn from the clear pay program  the pcs group has initiated more stringent credit checks on potential customers  as well as deposit requirements in many categories 
as a result  improvements were noted in the involuntary component of the churn rate by the end of the fourth quarter of in  the churn rate improved during the first half of the year  reaching as low as 
this improvement reflected increased percentage of customers under contract  the success of several customer retention initiatives and expanded network coverage 
these improvements were offset by an increase in the churn rate for the last half of resulting from customer fulfillment of contract terms  the softness of the economy  and the clear pay program 
the pcs group expects the customer churn rate to steadily improve throughout revenues from sales of handsets and accessories were approximately of net operating revenues in  in and in as part of the pcs group s marketing plans  handsets are usually sold at prices below the pcs group s cost 
cost of services and products the pcs group s costs of services and products mainly include handset and accessory costs  switch and cell site expenses  customer care costs and other network related costs 
these costs increased in and in the increase is primarily due to network support of a larger customer base  expanded market coverage and increased handset unit costs 
these increases are somewhat offset by scale benefits resulting from the increased customer base and decreases in customer solutions expense 
the increase reflects significant growth in customers and expanded market coverage  partly offset by a reduction in handset unit costs

cpga increased approximately in compared to a reduction of approximately in the cpga increase is primarily attributable to marketing costs and equipment subsidies associated with the launch of pcs vision  as well as costs being spread across lower gross customer additions 
in  lower handset unit costs and scale benefits from greater customer additions contributed to the improvement 
cash costs per user ccpu is a measure of the cash costs to operate the business on a per user basis  consisting of costs of service revenues  service delivery and other general and administrative costs  divided by average subscribers
