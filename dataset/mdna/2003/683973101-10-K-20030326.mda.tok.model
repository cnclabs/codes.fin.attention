the license of our software products is typically an executive level decision by prospective end users and generally requires our sales staff and or our advantage partners aps to engage in a lengthy and complex sales cycle typically between six and twelve months from the initial contact date 
we distribute our products through a direct sales force and a network of aps 
for  approximately of our license revenues were derived from our aps and the remaining license fees were derived from direct sales 
however  no individual customer accounted for more than of our total revenues 
for the years ended december   and  we generated approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues from international sales 
our revenues consist primarily of license revenues  which are comprised of one time fees for the license of our products  service revenues  and maintenance revenues  which are comprised of fees for upgrades and technical support 
our aps  which are responsible for the installation and integration of the software for their customers  enter into sales agreements with the end user  and license software directly from us 
we license software directly to the end user through software license agreements 
annual maintenance agreements are also entered into between the aps and the end user  and the aps then purchase maintenance services directly from us 
for and  approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from software licenses and approximately of our total revenues were derived from maintenance agreements

critical accounting policies this section discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  bad debts  restructuring charges  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  forecasts and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we earn our revenue primarily from software licenses and related service 
our revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  as amended by statement of position for sales made either through our aps or by us  we generally recognize license revenue upon shipment when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed or a purchase order has been received  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
the license fees are not assumed to be fixed or determinable if the fees are due more than months after delivery or are based on achievement of a milestone 
where applicable  fees from multiple element arrangements are unbundled and recorded as revenue as the elements are delivered to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for the various elements 
we establish vsoe of fair value on maintenance and professional services elements based on prices charged when the same elements are sold in separate transactions 
we have not established vsoe on license elements 
revenue on undelivered and delivered elements is recorded using the residual method in accordance with sop  as amended 
software maintenance revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period  which is generally one year 
the unrecognized portion of software maintenance revenues is recorded in the accompanying balance sheets as deferred revenue 
other revenues are recognized as services are performed 
we generally do not grant rights to return products  except for defects in the performance of the products relative to specifications and pursuant to standard industry shrink wrapped license agreements which provide for a day right of return if an end user does not accept the terms of the shrink wrapped license agreements 
the day right of return begins upon product shipment 
our software license agreements generally do not provide price adjustments or rotation rights 
we generally include a day limited warranty with the software license  which entitles the end user to corrections for documented program errors 
accounting for income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance against our carryforward tax benefits to the extent that we believe that it is more likely than not all of such benefits will not be realized in the near term 
we perform our assessment of benefit realization and the associated valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
our assessment of this valuation allowance was made using all available evidence  both positive and negative 
in particular we considered both our historical results and our projections of profitability for only reasonably foreseeable future periods 
our realization of the recorded net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income and therefore  we cannot be assured that such benefits will be realized 
based on management s current projections  we will continue to evaluate releasing a portion of the valuation allowance over the next year if planned operating results are achieved 
accounting for preferred stock in we completed the sale of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to an investor group consisting principally of thomas weisel capital partners and affiliated entities for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the preferred stock was subject to mandatory redemption provisions on the eighth anniversary of the issuance for cash equal to the stated liquidation preference plus accumulated unpaid dividends 
the preferred stock was convertible to common stock at the holder s option based upon the conversion formula as defined in the preferred stock certificate of designation 
the million in gross proceeds received was allocated as follows approximately million for the preferred stock  approximately million for the beneficial conversion feature  and approximately million for the warrants 
the initial carrying amount of the preferred stock was increased by periodic accretions so that the carrying amount would have been equal to the redemption amount million at the redemption date in the periodic increases in the carrying amount were effected by charges against additional paid in capital 
as the preferred stock was convertible into common stock at any time  the beneficial conversion amount was accreted in its entirety at the date of issuance of the preferred stock 
the warrants were to expire in and as of may  no warrants were exercised 
the fair value of the warrants was separately recorded as warrants for the purchase of our common stock and as a reduction to the series a convertible preferred stock 
on may   we entered into an exchange agreement with thomas weisel capital partners lp  a delaware limited partnership  certain of its affiliates and rkb capital  lp the purchasers pursuant to which we have issued series a convertible preferred stock  having the terms and provisions set forth in the certificate of designation designating the series a convertible preferred stock  on a one for one basis  in return for the exchange  surrender and cancellation of the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock 
the series a preferred issued in exchange for the series a preferred is substantially identical to the series a preferred 
the series a preferred contains certain changes from the series a which include eliminating the dividend and redemption requirements and modifying the protective and liquidation provisions thereof 
in connection with this transaction  we also purchased the warrants associated with the series a preferred for an aggregate of 
the series a preferred is convertible to common stock at the holders option based upon the conversion formula as defined in the certificate of designation 
upon the occurrence of a change of control event  such as a sale of assets or merger in which the consideration to be received consists solely of stock  the holders of the series a preferred stock are entitled to receive the greater of i a liquidation preference of approximately million in stock or ii the amount of stock they would have otherwise received upon conversion to common stock  prior to any distribution to the holders of our common stock 
upon the occurrence of any change of control event which includes a cash component  the holders of the series a preferred stock are entitled to convert their shares into enough common shares to enable them to receive at least million in cash following such conversion 
the holders of the series a preferred must approve any stock or cash based change of control event in which they would not receive at least million in the form of a liquid security  provided that in the event that the holders of the series a preferred stock elect not to approve a change of control event  we have the option of repurchasing the series a preferred stock for million and proceeding with the transaction 
as of february  the conversion formula was shares of common for every share of preferred 
the series a preferred was recorded in stockholders equity at its fair value 
the difference between the carrying value of the series a preferred at the time of the exchange and the fair value of the series a preferred of million as determined by an independent valuation was recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital and as a one time adjustment to net income loss applicable to common stockholders 
as a result of the exchange agreement  future periods will not have adjustments to income for accumulating dividends or allocations of the discounts associated with the series a preferred stock 
accounting for restructuring activities during february  we reduced our workforce by approximately 
this reduction in force resulted in approximately million of restructuring charges to earnings in the first quarter of  primarily to cover severance and severance related costs

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statement no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections as of april  which is effective for certain transactions occurring after may  and for financial statements issued on or after may  sfas no

 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the adoption of sfas no 
on may  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities 
sfas no 
is applicable to restructuring activities and costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and one time benefit arrangements received by employees who are involuntarily terminated 
sfas supersedes eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under sfas no 
the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized in the periods in which it is incurred rather than at the date committed to the exit plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  with earlier adoption encouraged 
previously issued financial statements will not be restated 
the provisions of eitf shall continue to apply for exit plans initiated prior to the adoption of sfas no 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the provisions of sfas no 
could impact the accounting for any future exit and disposal activities  including the period in which exit costs are recorded 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure as amendment to fas sfas no 
provides two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the preferable method of accounting for stock based compensation 
further  the statement requires disclosure of comparable information for all companies regardless of whether  when or how an entity adopts the preferable  fair value based method of accounting 
as we continued to disclose the fair value of stock option compensation only  sfas no 
did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the transition and annual disclosures of sfas no 
have been disclosed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  we had million in short term investments that are sensitive to market risks 
our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
we do not own any derivative financial instruments 
due to the nature of our investment portfolio we are primarily subject to interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio includes fixed rate debt instruments that are primarily municipal bonds with maturity periods within one year 
the market value of these bonds is subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates increase 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from december   would cause the fair market value of these short term investments to change by an insignificant amount 
although the market value of these short term investments would change due to the interest rate fluctuation  we have the ability to hold the investments to maturity  which would reduce overall market risk
