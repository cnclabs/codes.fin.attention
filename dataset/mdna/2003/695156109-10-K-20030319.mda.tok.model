item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 
overview in connection with the april  transactions  pca acquired the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation the group  formerly known as tenneco packaging inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco  inc the group operated prior to april  as a division of pactiv  and not as a separate  stand alone entity 
from its formation in january and through the closing of the acquisition on april   pca did not have any significant operations 
the april  acquisition was accounted for using historical values for the contributed assets 
purchase accounting was not applied because  under the applicable accounting guidance  a change of control was deemed not to have occurred as a result of the participating veto rights held by pactiv after the closing of the transactions under the terms of the stockholders agreement entered into in connection with the transactions 
general containerboard demand is dependent upon both domestic demand for corrugated products and linerboard export activity 
according to pulp paper week  after giving effect to price changes in  average mid point prices in december for linerboard and corrugating medium  east  were higher than december prices 
pulp paper week  in its february  publication  reported that average prices for linerboard and corrugating medium decreased per ton  or  and per ton  or  respectively  compared to december levels 
the march  pulp paper week publication reported that prices remained unchanged from february levels 
results of operations the historical results of operations of pca are set forth below in millions for the year ended december  net sales operating income interest expense income before taxes  cumulative effect of accounting change and extraordinary item provision for income taxes income before cumulative effect of accounting change and extraordinary item cumulative effect of accounting change extraordinary item net income preferred dividends and accretion of preferred stock issuance costs net income available to common shareholders year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard  partially offset by increased corrugated products volume and slightly higher volume of containerboard sold to third parties 
total corrugated products volume increased to billion square feet in compared to billion square feet in on a comparable shipment per workday basis  corrugated products volume increased in from the larger percentage increase was due to the fact that had one more workday  those days not falling on a weekend or holiday  than containerboard volume to external domestic and export customers increased to  tons for the year ended december  from  tons in the comparable period of our total containerboard mill production in was  tons compared to  tons in according to pulp paper week  average industry mid point linerboard and semi chemical medium prices for lb 
liner east and lb 
medium east  which are representative benchmark grades  were and  respectively  per ton in this compares to and  respectively  per ton in with respect to box prices  pca realized an additional per ton increase in october after implementing per ton increases in both august and september 
in november  pulp paper week reported that average linerboard prices for lb 
liner east decreased per ton to per ton 
the same publication reported that prices for lb 
medium east  semi chemical medium remained unchanged for the month at per ton 
pulp paper week reported no changes in linerboard or medium prices in december 
income before interest expense and income taxes operating income operating income decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales prices  which reduced operating income by million  plus increased costs for recycled fiber at our containerboard mills  higher medical costs and increased depreciation expense 
these items were only partially offset by increased corrugated products and containerboard volume 
pca did not record any material benefit related to changes in accounting treatment of goodwill in goodwill amortization was not material for the years ended december  and gross profit decreased million  or  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from of sales in to of sales in the current year primarily due to the sales price decreases described above 
corporate overhead for the year ended december   increased by million  or  from the year ended december  selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of increased salary  medical and other general selling related expenses 
interest expense and income taxes interest expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable period in  primarily due to prepayments pca made in and on the term loans under its senior credit facility and the receivables credit facility 
pca s effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of due to state income taxes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of decreased sales prices  reduced volume of containerboard sold to third parties  and slightly lower corrugated products volume 
total corrugated products volume decreased to billion square feet in compared to billion square feet in on a comparable shipment per workday basis  corrugated products volume decreased in from the larger percentage decrease was due to the fact that had one more workday  those days not falling on a weekend or holiday  than containerboard volume to external domestic and export customers decreased to  tons for the year ended december  from  tons in the comparable period of our total containerboard mill production in was  tons compared to  tons in according to pulp paper week  average industry mid point linerboard and semi chemical medium prices for lb 
liner east and lb 
medium east  which are representative benchmark grades  were and  respectively  per ton in this compares to and  respectively  per ton in income before interest expense and income taxes operating income operating income decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the decrease was the result of decreased sales prices which reduced operating income by million in addition to lower volume of containerboard sold to third parties  and slightly lower corrugated products volume 
operating income for excludes a fourth quarter gain on timberland sales of million 
gross profit decreased million  or  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from of sales in to of sales in primarily due to the sales price decreases described above 
corporate overhead for the year ended december   increased by million  or  from the year ended december  selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of increased salary and other general selling related expenses 
interest expense and income taxes interest expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable period in  primarily due to prepayments pca made on its term loans under the senior credit facility 
pca s effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of due to state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash flow provided by operating activities decreased million  or  to million  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower net income as a result of decreased sales prices of containerboard and corrugated products  as well as decreased deferred income taxes and unfavorable changes in working capital 
the unfavorable changes in working capital were primarily driven by higher balances of accounts receivable related to the strong sales volumes previously described  partially offset by lower inventory levels and a smaller reduction of the accounts payable balance than in cash flow provided by operating activities decreased million  or  to million  for the year ended december  from the comparable period in the decrease was primarily due to lower net income and decreased deferred taxes partially offset by a favorable change in working capital  caused by lower balances of accounts receivable due to lower sales prices and volumes described previously 
investing activities cash used for investing activities decreased by million  or  to million  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the change was primarily the result of decreased additions to property  plant and equipment and one business acquisition in the second quarter of cash used for investing activities increased by million  or  to million  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the change was primarily attributable to a reduction in proceeds from timberland sales of million 
as of december   pca had commitments for capital expenditures of million 
pca believes operating cash flow from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 
financing activities cash used for financing activities decreased by million  or  to million  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily attributable to decreased prepayments made by pca on its various debt agreements and a decrease in expenditures to repurchase pca common stock 
cash used for financing activities decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily reflecting decreased prepayments made by pca on its various debt agreements 
on january   pca became a publicly traded company with an initial public offering of its common stock 
on march   pca used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem all of its outstanding shares of senior exchangeable preferred stock due on november   pca completed the sale of approximately  acres of timberland to southern timber venture  llc 
pca received million in cash and a equity ownership interest in southern timber venture  llc 
pca recorded a pre tax gain of million  and a portion of the gain was not recognized as a result of pca s continuing ownership interest 
in march pca received a million dividend million  after tax from southern timber venture  llc 
on november   pca established an on balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable 
to effectuate this program  pca formed a wholly owned limited purpose subsidiary  packaging credit company  llc  or pcc  which in turn formed a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose subsidiary  packaging receivables company  llc  or prc  for the purpose of acquiring receivables from pcc 
both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of pca 
under this program  pcc purchases on an ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of pca and sells such receivables to prc 
prc and lenders established a million receivables backed revolving credit facility through which prc obtains funds to purchase receivables from pcc 
the receivables purchased by prc are and will be solely the property of prc 
in the event of a liquidation of prc  the creditors of prc would be entitled to satisfy their claims from prc s assets prior to any distribution to pcc or pca 
credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowing base formula 
as a result  the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times 
as of december   million was outstanding and million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables credit facility 
the highest outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit facility during fiscal was million 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes pca s contractual obligations at december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years term loans receivables credit facility senior subordinated notes   callable beginning april  at other long term debt total short term and long term debt operating leases purchase commitments letters of credit total the lease commitments  purchase commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on pca s consolidated balance sheet as of december  see notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements for additional information 
pca s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under pca s senior revolving credit facility and receivables credit facility 
as of december   pca had million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit agreements 
pca s primary uses of cash are for debt service and capital expenditures 
pca expects to be able to fund its debt service and capital expenditures from these sources 
the following table provides the outstanding balance and the weighted average interest rate as of december  for each of pca s outstanding term loans  the revolving credit facility and the receivables credit facility borrowing arrangement in thousands balance at december  weighted average interest rate term loan a a term loan b a senior revolving credit facility revolver eurodollar n a revolver base rate n a receivables credit facility total a the term loan interest rates reflect the floor of the interest rate collar agreement that expires in june of plus the applicable spread 
the floor of this agreement was at december  in addition to the term loans and other borrowing arrangements noted above  pca has million of senior subordinated notes callable beginning april  at and due the borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility are available to fund pca s working capital requirements  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
the term loan a must be repaid in quarterly installments from september through the term loan b must be repaid in quarterly installments from march through the senior revolving credit facility will terminate in the receivables credit facility will terminate on november  since april   pca has made prepayments totaling approximately  million using cash flow from operations of million and proceeds from the sales of timberland of million to permanently reduce its borrowings under the term loans and variable rate debt 
the instruments governing pca s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that restrict  among other things  the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  consummate certain asset sales  incur liens  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of pca 
these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities 
in addition  we must maintain minimum debt service  minimum net worth and maximum leverage ratios under the senior credit facility 
a failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior credit facility could lead to an event of default  which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness 
such an acceleration would also constitute an event of default under the notes indenture and the receivables credit facility 
pca estimates that it will make approximately million in capital expenditures in these expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance capital  cost reduction  business growth  and environmental compliance 
pca believes that cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet its anticipated debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs for the next months  and that cash generated from operations and amounts available under the senior revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet its anticipated debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
pca s future operating performance and its ability to service or refinance the notes and to service  extend or refinance the credit facilities will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond pca s control 
environmental matters we are subject to  and must comply with  a variety of federal  state and local environmental laws  particularly those relating to air and water quality  waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater 
because environmental regulations are constantly evolving  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  costs to maintain compliance with those laws 
in particular  the epa finalized the cluster rules which govern pulp and paper mill operations  including those at the counce  filer city  valdosta and tomahawk mills 
over the next several years  the cluster rules will affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants  and require us to spend money to ensure compliance with those new rules 
as is the case with any industrial operation  we have  in the past  incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination  as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  commonly known as the federal superfund law  and analogous state laws 
cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties we currently own or operate  former facilities and off site facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances 
under the terms of the contribution agreement  pactiv has agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre closing off site waste disposal 
pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city  michigan unrelated to current mill operations 
because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict  meaning that liability is imposed without fault  joint and several  meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution  and retroactive  we could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material 
from january through december  remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about million 
as of december   we maintained an environmental reserve of million  which includes funds relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as on going and anticipated remedial projects 
total capital costs for environmental matters  including cluster rule compliance  were million for and we currently estimate environmental capital expenditures will be million  of which million of the expenditures are to meet cluster rule requirements 
impact of inflation pca does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations during the past three years 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  pensions and other post retirement benefits  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial downgrading of credit sources  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts consisting of for amounts less than days past due and for amounts more than days past due based on our historical collection experience 
if our collection experience deteriorates ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
as of december   the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve was million  compared to million at december  bad debt expense in was million  compared to million in of the million increase  million was attributable to three customers that filed for bankruptcy during for the year ended december  bad debt expense was million compared to million in during  million of bad debt expense was attributable to six customers that filed for bankruptcy during the year 
inventory we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  reductions in the value of inventory may be required 
raw materials  work in process and finished goods are valued using the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market method 
supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost 
derivatives we hold derivative financial instruments to hedge our interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long term debt 
these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as discussed in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
we do not speculate in derivatives trading 
hedge accounting results when we designate and document the hedging relationships involving these derivative instruments 
while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if hedges do not qualify as highly effective or if we did not believe that forecasted transactions would occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
to hedge interest rate risk  interest rate collars are used to protect against rising interest rates and simultaneously guarantee minimum interest rates related to our variable rate debt 
these instruments are valued using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future cash receipts and cash payments 
the cash receipts and cash payments are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interest rate curves 
we have not changed our methods of calculating these fair values or developing the underlying assumptions 
the values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
information about the fair values  notional amounts  and contractual terms of these instruments can be found in notes and to our audited consolidated financial statements and the section titled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to the above derivative financial instruments  we have other contracts covering a portion of our purchases of natural gas and electricity that have the characteristics of derivatives but are not required to be accounted for as derivatives 
these contracts for the physical delivery of these items qualify for the normal purchases exception under sfas no 
as we take physical delivery of the item and use it in the production process 
this exception is an election and  if not elected  these contracts would be carried on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in income 
these contracts cover natural gas and electricity usage at our mills through at december   estimated future payments under these contracts amounted to million 
environmental liabilities the estimated landfill closure and postclosure maintenance costs expected to be incurred upon and subsequent to the closing of existing operating landfill areas are accrued based on the landfill capacity used to date 
amounts are estimates using current technologies for closure and monitoring and are not discounted 
the potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs  the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations  and the timing  varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies 
liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions 
because of these uncertainties  however  our estimates may change 
we believe that any additional costs identified as further information becomes available would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in connection with the sale to pca of the containerboard and corrugated products business of pactiv corporation in april  pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with offsite waste disposal prior to april  pactiv also retained environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the filer city mill 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability would be performed 
if an evaluation were required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if a write down to fair value were required 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
new accounting standards for a description of changes in accounting principles affecting pca  see note to pca s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk pca is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments 
pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
pca has interest rate collar agreements that protect against rising interest rates and simultaneously guarantee a minimum interest rate 
the notional amount of these collar agreements was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the weighted average floor of the interest rate collar agreements was and as of december  and  respectively 
the weighted average ceiling of the interest rate collar agreements was and as of december  and the interest rate on approximately and of pca s variable rate debt as of december  and  respectively  was capped 
pca receives payments under the collar agreements if the applicable interest rate libor or commercial paper exceeds the ceiling 
correspondingly  pca makes payments under the collar agreements if the applicable interest rate drops below the floor 
in both cases  the amounts received or paid are based upon the notional amount and the difference between the actual interest rate and the ceiling or floor rate 
at december   the commercial paper based interest rate collar agreement expired 
the remaining interest rate collar agreement  with a floor of  expires june  as a result of the collar agreements noted above and the interest rate environment  a one percent increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of approximately million and million annually for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  the weighted average libor was and  respectively  and the weighted average commercial paper rate was and  respectively 
the effect of an interest rate change to the fair market value of the outstanding debt is insignificant 
this analysis does not consider any other impact on fair market value that could exist in such an interest rate environment 
in the event of a change in interest rates  management could take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in pca s financial structure
