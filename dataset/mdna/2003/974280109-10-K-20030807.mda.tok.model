critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  and in some cases  actuarial calculations 
the company constantly reviews these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from estimated results determined using the factors described above 

table of contents the following is a discussion of the accounting policies considered to be most critical to the company 
the accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail sales 
sales discounts offered to customers at the time of purchase  as part of the company s customer reward card program as well as other promotional events  are recorded as a reduction of sales at the time of purchase 
merchandise cost 
the company receives various rebates from third party vendors in the form of promotional allowances  quantity discounts and payments under merchandising agreements 
such rebates are classified as either a reduction to cost of goods sold or a reduction of cost incurred  depending on the nature of the rebate 
promotional allowances  including lump sum payments associated with long term contracts  are recorded as a component of cost of sales as they are earned  the recognition of which is determined in accordance with the underlying agreement with the vendor  the authoritative guidance and completion of the earnings process 
portions of promotional allowances that are contractually refundable to the vendor  in whole or in part  are deferred from recognition until realization is assured 
quantity discounts and merchandising agreements are typically measured and earned based on inventory purchases or sales volume levels and are received from vendors at the time certain performance measures are achieved 
these performance based rebates are recognized as a component of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation of the consideration received relative to the transaction that marks the progress of the company toward earning the rebate or refund 
if the amounts are not probable and reasonably estimable  rebate income is recognized upon achieving the performance measure 
some rebates received from third party vendors require the company to make assumptions and judgments regarding specific purchase or sales levels and an estimation of the related inventory turns 
the company constantly reviews the relevant significant assumptions and estimates and makes adjustments as necessary 
although the company believes that the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable  significant changes in these arrangements or purchase volumes could have a material effect on future cost of sales 
self insurance reserves 
it is the company s policy to self insure for certain insurable risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property  business interruptions  workers compensation  comprehensive general and auto liability 
insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
liabilities relating to worker s compensation  comprehensive general and auto liability claims are based on independent actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims 
the actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty from various sources  including changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  and economic conditions 
although the company believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable  significant 
table of contents differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the company s self insurance obligations and future expense 
long lived assets 
the company periodically evaluates the period of depreciation or amortization for long lived assets to determine whether current circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives 
the company reviews its property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
an impairment loss would be recorded for the excess of net book value over the fair value of the asset impaired 
the fair value is estimated based on expected discounted future cash flows 
with respect to owned property and equipment associated with closed stores  the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on the company s prior history of disposing of similar assets and current economic conditions 
the results of impairment tests are subject to management s estimates and assumptions of projected cash flows and operating results 
the company believes that  based on current conditions  materially different reported results are not likely to result from long lived asset impairments 
however  a change in assumptions or market conditions could result in a change in estimated future cash flows and the likelihood of materially different reported results 
intangible assets and goodwill 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at the time of adoption and establish a new method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the reporting unit level or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company has determined that it is contained within one reporting unit and  as such  impairment is tested at the company level 
sfas also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized  but separately tested for impairment using a fair value based approach 
the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates including  but not limited to  projected future revenue and cash flows 
the company believes that  based on current conditions  materially different reported results are not likely to result from goodwill and intangible impairments 
however  a change in assumptions or market conditions could result in a change in estimated future cash flows and the likelihood of materially different reported results 
store closing costs 
the company provides for closed store liabilities relating to the estimated post closing lease liabilities and other related exit costs associated with the store closing commitments 
the closed store liabilities are usually paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores having remaining terms ranging from one to years 
the company estimates the lease liabilities  net of estimated sublease income only to the extent of the liability  using a discount rate based on long term rates with a remaining lease term based on an estimated disposition date to calculate the present value of the anticipated rent payments on closed stores 
other exit costs include estimated real estate taxes  common area 
table of contents maintenance  insurance and utility costs to be incurred after the store closes over the anticipated lease term 
store closings are generally completed within one year after the decision to close 
adjustments to closed store liabilities and other exit costs primarily relate to changes in subtenants and actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known 
any excess accrued store closing liability remaining upon settlement of the obligation is reversed to income in the period that such settlement is determined 
inventory write downs  if any  in connection with store closings  are classified in cost of sales 
costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred 
severance costs are rarely incurred in connection with ordinary store closings 
store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly and adjusted to ensure that any accrued amount is properly stated 
although the company believes that the estimates used are reasonable  significant differences related to the items noted above or a change in market conditions could materially affect the company s reserve for closed store obligations and future expense
