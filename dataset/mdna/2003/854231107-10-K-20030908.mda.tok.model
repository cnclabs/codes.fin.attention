item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements contained in the following management s discussion and analysis that are not based on historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  expect  believe  estimate  anticipate  continue  or similar terms or variations of those terms or the negative of those terms 
there are many factors that affect the company s business and the results of its operations and may cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 
these factors include uncertainties in competitive pricing pressures  unforeseen volatility in financial markets  general domestic and international business and economic conditions and market demand 
overview standex is a leading  diversified  multi industry manufacturer 
we produce a variety of products and provide services for selected market segments  with operations in three business segments food service  industrial  and consumer 
our goals have remained constant through the years continue to make strategic acquisitions while providing our customers with customer driven and engineered solutions to meet their changing needs 
the following discussion and analysis covers key drivers behind our results for and is broken down into three major sections 
first  we discuss our liquidity and capital resources followed by an overview and discussion of operations for the years through on a consolidated basis and by business segment 
lastly  we discuss our risk management techniques  critical accounting policies and impacts of future accounting changes 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from continuing operating activities and the revolving credit facility with eight banks 
in  continuing operations generated million compared to million last year in cash flow 
the increase year over year came as a result of a million decrease in net working capital 
net working capital is defined as accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable 
in addition  the sale of certain real estate generated million of incremental cash during the year while discontinued operations contributed million in cash flows during the year 
we redeployed those resources by investing million in cash to expand several core businesses by making three acquisitions and by investing million in capital expenditures 
in addition  we returned million to shareholders through cash dividends million and share repurchases million 
the remaining cash flow from continuing operating activities was used to reduce net debt by million 
this represents the fourth consecutive year in which standex has generated cash from operations in excess of million  and the highest amount in the history of the company 
we believe that cash flows from continuing operating activities in fiscal will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures  restructuring activities  operating lease payments  pension contributions and mandatory debt payments 
we expect to spend between million and million on capital expenditures in fiscal in addition  we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities 
any cash needed for future acquisition opportunities would be obtained through a combination of any remaining cash flows from continuing operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
in the event that cash flows from continuing operating activities would not be sufficient  we have available borrowing capacity under various agreements of up to million as of june  capital structure during  we entered into a new million unsecured revolving credit facility with eight banks  of which million was unused and million was available at june  this revolving credit facility replaced the previous revolving credit facility of million 
proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes or to provide financing for acquisition activity 
available borrowings under the revolving credit facility are reduced by unsecured short term borrowings 
in addition  at june   we have a money market credit facility with one bank 
the agreement provides for a maximum unsecured credit line of million  of which million is unused and available 
in addition  we entered into a note purchase agreement with two institutional investors for million 
on june  and  the company s credit quality designation was naic the following table sets forth the company s capitalization at june year ended june in thousands short term debt  long term debt   total debt   less cash   total net debt   stockholders equity   total capitalization   stockholders equity decreased year over year primarily as a result of the recording of an additional pension liability net of tax benefit of million partially offset by favorable foreign currency movements of million 
short and long term net debt decreased by million to million at june  even with the above  the company s net debt to capital percentage improved to from in historically low interest rates  another year of negative performance of the equity markets  and changes in actuarial assumptions including mortality rates caused standex to suffer higher pension liabilities and lower pension assets 
these assumptions are more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the company recorded a million after tax equity charge in the fourth quarter to reflect the additional minimum liability under these plans 
this after tax equity charge did not impact cash or earnings and could reverse in future periods should either interest rates increase and or market performance and plan returns improve 
pension expenses are expected to increase by approximately per diluted share in as a result of the funded status of the pension plans and changes in actuarial assumptions 
contribution requirements in are expected to be approximately million 
the company has an insurance program for certain key executives 
the underlying policies have a cash surrender value of million and are reported net of loans of million for which the company has the legal right of offset 
these policies have been purchased to fund supplemental retirement income benefits for certain executives 
the aggregate present value of future obligations was  and  at june  and  respectively 
the company is contractually obligated under various operating leases for real property 
the company sponsors a number of both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans 
we have evaluated the current and long term cash requirements of these plans 
as noted above  the operating cash flows from continuing operations is expected to be sufficient to cover required contributions under erisa and other governing rules 
contractual obligations of the company as of june  are as follows in millions less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years long and short term obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term contractual liabilities total off balance sheet items the company had no off balance sheet items at june  fiscal as compared to fiscal summary net sales from continuing operations were million  an increase of two percent from last year s net sales of million 
the fiscal sales include an extra month of european sales of million resulting from the company s decision to conform the accounting year of its european operations to the corporate fiscal year ending june foreign exchange rate changes favorably impacted the current year sales by approximately million 
both the industrial and food service segments recorded improved performances over the previous year  while both sales and operating income of the consumer segment were below prior year levels 
the gross margin for was  down from in the prior year 
the year over year decline is primarily due to the substitution of lower margin sales in the food service and industrial groups for higher margin sales in the consumer group 
in october  we announced a restructuring and realignment plan in the amount of to million to be incurred over eighteen months 
we designed the plan to improve the company s operating performance 
the plan involves disposal or closing of certain under performing operating plants  product lines  manufacturing processes and businesses  realignment and consolidation of certain marketing and distribution activities  and other cost containment actions  including selective personnel reductions 
we estimate that these actions will yield annual cost savings of million once fully implemented 
during we completed the following restructuring activities the integration of useco manufacturing activities into the master bilt operations  the closure of an underutilized air distribution products facility in north carolina  the transfer of various manufacturing operations to mexico  and the closure of a mold tech operation in california 
we recognized million for these restructuring activities 
during  we exited our hf coors food service and national metals industrial businesses 
these actions were also taken as part of our realignment plan as we concluded that the two businesses either had limited growth prospects or that these businesses were not suited for long term strategic growth under our ownership 
the real property of hf coors and the business were sold in separate transactions while national metal industries was closed 
discontinued operations include the results of operations of these businesses and the gain realized on the sale of the hf coors property  net of our exit cost 
in the second quarter of  the chief executive officer and the executive vice president operations elected early retirement 
the charges related to these retirements include costs that previously were being amortized to an anticipated retirement age of  the net present value of the conversion feature of life insurance policies  and a retirement bonus 
the majority of these benefits will be paid over the next ten years  and  accordingly  the total benefits have been discounted to their present value of million  which is included in the caption other expenses  net in the statements of consolidated income 
also included in this caption is a gain million on the sale of a manufacturing facility of a uk subsidiary  which was completed in october  this sale is a part of the company s realignment strategy 
after taking all these matters into account  income from continuing operations was million as compared to million in the prior year 
interest expense decreased by million due to lower average borrowing levels and lower average interest rates on our variable rate debt 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was versus fiscal s rate of 
the previous fiscal year s tax rate was affected by the implementation of tax planning strategies  transactional based benefits from distributions from foreign subsidiaries and decreased levels of various tax contingencies which resulted in one time benefits 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a charge of million  which represented the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the change related to the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
effective july  the above resulted in a decline in net income from last year s million to the current year s million 
industrial segment net sales increased by million 
of this increase million was due to the extra month of european sales noted above  and million was due to the effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates 
the remaining increase of million was primarily due to volume increases in our standex engraving  spincraft and electronics divisions 
gross profits for this segment improved from to due to improved volume levels partially offset by significantly higher steel costs incurred primarily by our air distribution division as a result of the steel tariff imposed in the spring of by the u 
s 
government 
operating income for the industrial segment rose by million over fiscal s million 
the standex engraving  spincraft and electronics divisions were the primary contributors to this increase  while operating income levels of our air distribution products division were negatively impacted by higher material costs for steel 
food service net sales increased by million to million in of this increase million was due to an extra month of european sales and million was due to the effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates 
the remaining million increase reflects primarily volume increases at master bilt  federal and our procon divisions as these businesses were able to gain market share 
gross profit margins declined from to  mainly due to lower volumes at our useco division combined with the integration costs that did not qualify as restructuring charges 
as a result of higher sales volumes  the segment reported a increase in operating income for fiscal as compared to fiscal consumer segment fiscal was a disappointing year for this segment 
a decrease in sales was recorded from fiscal s million 
the results of the mail order business were negatively impacted by weak consumer demand and a shorter christmas holiday season 
in addition  higher marketing expenses were incurred to reach new customers  but did not yield the expected results 
the bookstore and publishing divisions also experienced weak consumer and church customer demand due to low consumer confidence 
additionally  marketing expenses increased in the publishing division due to the launch of a new product 
although the segment s gross margins were only slightly affected a decline of one percentage point  operating income decreased by from the prior year s million 
cost reduction opportunities have been  and will continue to be  actively pursued which should lead to improved results in corporate the expenses of this segment rose from million to million in the current year 
this increase is due to higher professional fees  a reduction in pension credits  and expenses not allocated to the divisions 
fiscal as compared to fiscal a difficult economic environment affected sales in all segments 
net sales from continuing operations for the year ended june  were million  a decrease from a year earlier as volume declined in each of the business segments 
the effect  on net sales  of changes in the average foreign exchange rates was not significant 
net earnings from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal earnings per share before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle decreased to per share from a year earlier 
the company recorded a charge of million representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to write off previously recorded goodwill 
the charge related to the company s adoption of sfas no 
effective july is described in detail in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a weakened economy  combined with the events of september th  negatively affected sales volumes in each of the segments 
because of the economic environment  in the fourth quarter of the company recorded higher than normal inventory reserves of million affecting all three segments 
interest expense decreased by million 
the decline reflects lower average borrowings driven by the company s strong cash flow performance in  and lower interest rates on the company s variable rate debt 
the effective tax rate was which included the effect of a change in accounting principle described above 
the decline in the effective tax rate from was affected by the implementation of additional tax planning strategies  transactional based benefits from distributions from foreign subsidiaries and decreased levels of various tax contingencies 
industrial segment the industrial segment was particularly hard hit by the recession 
segment sales decreased 
atc frost was acquired in late fiscal excluding this acquisition s impact on fiscal  segment sales decreased by 
lower sales volume and negative price pressure from discounting activities was somewhat offset by the effect of a strong housing market 
the segment s gross profit margin declined slightly to from due to the above 
operating income was also negatively impacted decreasing by from fiscal s million 
food service segment the decline in food service segment sales was primarily due to lower sales volumes caused by a weak economy 
demand was weak as customers delayed or scaled back their rollout programs 
a small decrease in gross profit margin from was recorded by this segment due to the sales decline 
a fall off in operating income to million was also recorded 
consumer segment net sales in the consumer segment decreased by 
reduced consumer confidence levels and the events of september th negatively affected segment performance 
due to sales mix  the gross profit margin in this segment improved to from 
however  reduced sales volume equated to a decline in operating income of from million 
corporate segment this segment s expenses increased by million due primarily to a lower return on pension and life insurance assets 
other matters inflation certain of the company s expenses  such as wages and benefits  occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
foreign currency translation the company s primary functional currencies used by its non us subsidiaries are the euro and the british pound sterling pound 
during the current year  both these currencies have experienced significant increases in value relative to the us dollar  the company s reporting currency 
since june  the euro has appreciated by relative to the us dollar  and the pound has appreciated by relative to the us dollar 
these higher exchange values were used in translating the appropriate non us subsidiaries balance sheets into non us dollars at the end of the current quarter 
environmental matters the company is party to various claims and legal proceedings  generally incidental to its business 
as explained more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we do not expect the ultimate disposition of these matters to have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 
seasonality typically  the second and fourth quarters have been the best quarters for our consolidated financial results 
due to the gift giving holiday season  the consumer segment has experienced strong sales benefiting the second quarter performance 
the fourth quarter performance has been enhanced by increased activity in the construction industry 
employee relations the company has labor agreements with a number of union locals in the united states and a number of european employees belong to european trade unions 
there were no work stoppages during fiscal year a total of seven collective bargaining contracts will expire in fiscal although we believe we have good employee relations  there can be no assurances that work stoppages can be avoided in future periods 
acquisitions our growth is dependent on not only organic growth within our existing businesses  but also the successful completion of acquisitions that align with the strategic goals of the company 
the ability to initiate these transactions is dependent upon the attraction of the target company and the acquisition multiples that the market is demanding 
acquisitions in june  the company completed the acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of i r international  inc and substantially all of the outstanding stock of dornbusch cia  a brazilian affiliate for a total purchase price of million in cash and unregistered stock 
the aggregate number of shares of common stock comprising the stock portion of the purchase price was  based on an average market price for the stock of per share 
ir manufactures  distributes and sells industrial  gravure and embossing rolls and plates  laser and gravure engraving  texturing and coating services from facilities in virginia and brazil 
ir is highly complimentary to our existing engraving businesses 
the acquisition increased our current market penetration and will further our ability to reach new markets such as south america 
in addition to the acquisition of ir  standex acquired dornbusch cia dornbusch located in sao paolo  brazil contingent upon receipt of various government approvals 
ir and dornbusch will be fully integrated with standex engraving 
the purchase price was allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulted in the recognition of goodwill of approximately million 
in september  we purchased substantially all of the assets of cincinnati  ohio based cin tran  inc  a manufacturer of custom ul csa approved low frequency transformers 
in december  the company acquired millennium molds  a repairer of injection molds 
the combined purchase price of these acquisitions was million 
both were treated as purchases 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all its subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
although we believe that materially different amounts would not be reported due to the accounting policies described below  the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have listed a number of accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical  but we also believe that all of our accounting policies are important to the reader 
therefore  please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these and other accounting policies of the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivables are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligation together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts 
actual collection experience may improve or decline 
inventories and related reserves for obsolete and excess inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are reduced by a reserve for excess and potentially obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews inventory values on hand using specific aging categories  and records a provision for obsolete and excess inventory based on historical usage and estimated future usage 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recorded a valuation allowance that represents foreign operating loss carry forwards for which utilization is uncertain 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
no provision for us income and foreign withholding taxes has been made for substantially all unrepatriated foreign earnings because it is expected that such earnings will be reinvested indefinitely or the distribution of any remaining amount would be principally offset by foreign tax credits 
workers compensation accrual the company is self insured for workers compensation at the majority of its divisions 
the accrual is evaluated frequently based on our actual claim experience 
management judgment is required in determining our expense and related contingency levels as actual future claim experience may differ from the projected claim experience 
projecting claims experience requires management to make assumptions about future liabilities for incidents which have already occurred but have not yet been reported and future health care cost trends 
environmental liabilities our global operations are regulated by laws for the protection of the environment 
under various circumstances these laws may require remediation at sites where hazardous substances have been released and are endangering the environment 
we have expended substantial resources to comply with the applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations and we maintain procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance 
however  we have been and may in the future be subject to formal or informal enforcement actions or proceedings regarding noncompliance with such laws or regulations  whether or not determined to be ultimately responsible  in the normal course of business 
goodwill we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles effective july  under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  however  goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually 
therefore  on an annual basis we test for goodwill impairment by estimating the fair value of our reporting units using the present value of future cash flows method 
in addition  goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill becomes impaired 
employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pensions and some post retirement benefits 
annually we record expenses relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap  which are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trends 
the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds and is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
we review our actuarial assumptions on at least an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
based on information provided by our actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that our assumptions are reasonable 
adoption of sfas and new accounting pronouncements effective july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas nos 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which creates one accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas no 
 to be applied to all long lived assets including discontinued operations 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
was not significant 
sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment to fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  among other things  restricts the classification of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt as extraordinary to only those transactions that are unusual and infrequent in nature as defined by apb opinion no 
as extraordinary 
there was no impact from the adoption of this sfas 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
the company announced in october that restructuring charges in the range of to million pre tax would be recorded over the next months see above 
if this sfas had not been adopted  a significant portion of these charges would have been recorded in the current year instead of the million pre tax  which has been recorded 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends the transition and disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement provides methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
the transition provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the disclosure provisions are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the company adopted the interim period disclosure provisions of statements in the third quarter of this year 
the adoption of statement had no effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use  from time to time  financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have internal policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of the treasurer and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes only 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes except for certain investments in connection with the keysop plan or speculation is strictly prohibited 
the company has no majority owned subsidiaries that are excluded from the consolidated financial statements 
further  the company has no interests or relationships with any special purpose entities 
exchange risk the company is exposed to both transactional risk and translation risk associated with exchange rates 
regarding transactional risk  the company mitigates certain of its foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward foreign currency contracts from time to time 
these contracts are used as a hedge against anticipated foreign cash flows  such as dividend and loan payments  and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts 
however  any such losses or gains would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses  respectively  on the related hedged asset or liability 
due to the absence of forward foreign currency contracts at june   the company did not have any fair value exposure for financial instruments 
within our foreign operations we are also exposed to transactional risks  specifically with our subsidiaries using the euro and the british pound sterling 
this transactional risk is mitigated  in large part  by natural hedges developed with locally denominated debt service 
a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the value of the euro to the us dollar at june  would result in an increase in short term debt of  on our consolidated balance sheet 
our primary translation risk was with the euro and the british pound sterling 
we do not hedge our translation risk 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect our stockholders equity 
interest rate the company s interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on its variable rate borrowings 
from time to time  the company will use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements 
as of june   a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would increase the company s annual interest expense by  the company had an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate on million of its variable rate borrowings 
this agreement expired in may at june   the company has no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
the company also has million of long term debt at fixed interest rates as of june  there would be no immediate impact on the company s interest expense associated with its long term debt due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
however  based on a hypothetical immediate decrease in market interest rates  the fair value of the company s long term debt would be increased by approximately million as of june  such fair value changes may affect the company s determination as to whether to retain  replace or retire its long term debt 
the company has a diversified customer base 
as such  the risk associated with concentration of credit risk is inherently minimized 
as of june and  no one customer accounted for more than of our outstanding receivables or of our sales 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities  primarily steel 
each of our segments is subject to the effects of changing raw material costs caused by the underlying commodity price movements 
in general  we do not enter into purchase contracts that extend beyond one operating cycle 
we do not believe that this exposure is material to the company
