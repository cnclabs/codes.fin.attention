item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading national provider of diagnostic imaging services through our ownership and operation of free standing  outpatient diagnostic imaging centers 
we utilize sophisticated technology and technical expertise to perform a broad range of imaging procedures  such as magnetic resonance imaging mri  computed tomography ct  positron emission tomography pet  nuclear medicine  ultrasound  mammography  bone densitometry dexa  general radiography x ray and fluoroscopy 
for the year ended december   we derived of our service fee revenue from the ownership  management and operation of our radiology and imaging center network and of our service fee revenue from the administrative  management and information services provided to contracted radiology practices 
as of december   we owned  operated or maintained an ownership interest in imaging equipment at locations and provided management services to ten radiology practices 
as of december   our imaging centers are located in states  with concentrated geographic coverage in markets located in california  florida  kansas  maryland  new york  texas and virginia 
we focus on providing quality patient care and service to ensure patient and referring physician satisfaction 
our development of comprehensive radiology networks permits us to invest in technologically advanced imaging equipment  including mri  open mri  spiral ct and pet 
our consolidation of diagnostic imaging centers into coordinated networks improves response time  increases overall patient accessibility  permits us to standardize certain customer relations procedures and permits us to develop best practices for our diagnostic imaging centers 
we seek the input and participation of the contracted radiology practices to which we provide administrative  management and information services to develop best practices and to improve productivity and the quality of services 
by focusing on further improving and  where appropriate  standardizing the operations of our diagnostic imaging centers  we believe that we can increase patient and referring physician satisfaction  which should lead to increased referrals and increased utilization of our diagnostic imaging centers 
we contract with radiology practices to provide professional services  including the supervision and interpretation of diagnostic imaging procedures performed in our diagnostic imaging centers 
we believe that we do not engage in the practice of medicine nor do we employ physicians 
the radiology practices maintain full control over the provision of professional radiological services 
the contracted radiology practices generally have outstanding physician and practice credentials and reputations  strong competitive market positions  a broad sub specialty mix of physicians  a history of growth and potential for continued growth  and a willingness to embrace our strategy for the delivery of diagnostic imaging services 
for the year ended december   payment for diagnostic imaging services came primarily from commercial third party payors  governmental payors  including medicare and medicaid and private and other payors 
in august  medicare made significant changes in the payment methodology for hospital outpatient services 
in january  medicare decreased the payment rates for physician and outpatient services  including diagnostic imaging services  by approximately 
this payment rate schedule is effective through february in february and to be effective march  through december   congress legislated an increase of approximately in the overall reimbursement rates for physician and outpatient services  including diagnostic imaging services 
our diagnostic imaging centers are principally dependent on our ability to attract referrals from primary care physicians  specialists and other healthcare providers 
the referral often depends on the existence of a contractual arrangement with the referred patient s health benefit plan 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenue generated at our diagnostic imaging centers was generated from capitated arrangements 
revenue of the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers is recorded when services are rendered by the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers based on established charges and reduced by contractual allowances 
in addition  bad debt expense related to established charges is recognized as costs and expenses rather than a deduction from revenue 
we use historical collection experience in estimating contractual adjustments and bad debt expense 
the factors influencing the historical collection experience include the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers patient mix  impact of managed care contract pricing and contract revenue and the aging of patient accounts receivable balances 
as these factors change  the historical collection experience is revised accordingly in the period known 
service fee revenue represents contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers revenue less amounts retained by contracted radiology practices 
the amounts retained by contracted radiology practices represents amounts paid to the physicians pursuant to the service agreements between us and the contracted radiology practices 
under the service agreements  we provide each contracted radiology practice with the facilities and equipment used in its medical practice  assume responsibility for managing the operations of the practice  and employ substantially all of the non physician personnel utilized by the contracted radiology practice 
although we assist in negotiating managed care contracts for the contracted radiology practices  we assume no risk under these arrangements 
our service fee revenue is dependent upon the operating results of the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers 
where state law allows  service fees due under the service agreements for the contracted radiology practices are derived from two distinct revenue streams a negotiated percentage up to of the adjusted professional revenues as defined in the service agreements  and of the adjusted technical revenues as defined in the service agreements 
in states where the law requires a flat fee structure  we have negotiated a base service fee  which is equal to the estimated fair market value of the services provided under the service agreements and which is renegotiated each year to equal the fair market value of the services provided under the service agreements 
adjusted professional revenues and adjusted technical revenues are determined by deducting contractually agreed upon expenses non physician salaries and benefits  rent  depreciation  insurance  interest and other physician costs from the contracted radiology practices revenue 
revenues of our subsidiary  questar imaging  inc questar are primarily derived from technical revenues generated from those imaging centers 
results of operations we report the results of our operations through four designated regions of the united states mid atlantic  northeastern  central and western regions 
in addition  we report separately the results of our operations of the imaging centers of our subsidiary  questar 
our operations in each of the four designated regions are comprised of the ownership and operation of diagnostic imaging centers and the provision of administrative  management and information services to the contracted radiology practices that provide professional interpretation and supervision services in connection with our diagnostic imaging centers and to hospitals and radiology practices with which we operate joint ventures 
our services leverage our existing infrastructure and improve radiology practice or joint venture profitability  efficiency and effectiveness 
we have divided the operations into the four regions and questar only for purposes of the division of internal management responsibilities  but do not focus on each of these regions as a separate product line or make financial decisions as if they were separate product lines 
the questar operations are treated as a separate group only from the perspective that the imaging centers of questar do not have the same type of management service agreement with physicians as we have with each of the contracted radiology practices in the four designated regions 
in addition  any imaging centers of questar that are in the same region as the operations of the contracted radiology practices in the four designated regions are not included in the service agreements of the contracted radiology practices 
for discussion and analysis purposes  the operating margin is defined as service fee revenue less operating expenses operating income as a percent of service fee revenue 
operating income as discussed below is defined as service fee revenue less operating expenses 
operating income is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the healthcare industry  and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability 
operating income should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  and the items excluded from operating income should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income  cash flows generated by operating  investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity 
because operating income is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  operating income as presented may not be comparable to other similarity titled measures of other companies 
during  our operating results were affected by such factors as increased competition  increased payor pre authorization activity  the social and economic environment  changing physician schedules  a shortage of technologists  and seasonality 
during the latter half of  increased competition resulted in lower volume than management had expected 
in addition to lower volumes  during the latter half of operating margins were impacted by the implementation of pre authorization programs by many of our larger payors  and the recruitment and retention of technologists 
recently  an increasing number of payors with which we do business have instituted more comprehensive pre authorization programs on certain procedures 
under pre authorization programs  the referring physician must justify medical necessity based on the payor s specific guidelines prior to the services being rendered 
also  in early fiscal the shortage of qualified technologists resulted in scheduling backlogs and lost procedure volumes 
as many of the open technologist positions were filled by mid  salaries and benefits increased 
these costs continued to increase or remain stable  while volume began to decline resulting in lower revenues from contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers 
the combined effect of increased salaries and benefits and lower revenues decreased our operating margins 
we cannot give any assurance that any of the factors discussed above will not continue to have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the operating margin for each of the regions and questar  decreased from the year ended december  to the year ended december  for the year ended december  and  the mid atlantic region decreased from to  the northeastern region decreased from to  the central region decreased from to  the western region decreased from to and questar decreased from to 
the decline in the operating margin for each of the four regions and questar was primarily affected by each of the factors discussed above 
additional factors in specific regions also contributed to the decreased operating margins 
in the central region  the decrease in the operating margins was partially offset by decreased purchased billing services and by increased technical revenues 
the operating margin in the western region was also impacted by a decrease in the number of hospitals in which we provide management services 
the decrease was partially offset by a decrease in rent expense  attributable to the purchase in december of equipment previously held under operating leases 
the operating margin for questar decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   due primarily to an impairment charge on long lived assets of million 
this was partially offset by improved collections compared to  which decreased estimated contractual allowances and  therefore  increased service fee revenue 
in march  radiologix acquired an imaging center in osceola  florida for total consideration of approximately million 
during  we continued to complete the development of imaging centers of questar for total consideration of approximately million 
total consideration paid for all other acquisitions and affiliations in was approximately million 
in november  radiologix acquired an imaging center in laurel  maryland for total consideration of  we completed no acquisitions in during  questar disposed of two imaging centers 
questar received consideration for the dispositions of approximately  in cash and the buyers assumed million of capital leases 
no material gain was recognized in as a result of the dispositions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  service fee revenue the following table sets forth the amounts of revenue from contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers and the amounts retained by the contracted radiology practices in thousands percent change revenue from contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers  net of contractual allowances   less amounts retained by contracted radiology practices   
service fee revenue  as reported   revenue from contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers  net of contractual allowances  increased million  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to increased revenues derived from increased volume at the diagnostic imaging centers  which increased our revenue from contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers 
amounts retained by contracted radiology practices increased from million in and of revenue to million in and of revenue 
the increase in revenue from contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers  net of contractual allowances  offset by the increase in amounts retained by contracted radiology practices  resulted in an increase in service fee revenue of million  from million in to million in salaries and benefits salaries and benefits increased million  from million in to million in salaries and benefits increased as volume and revenues increased and as the cost of salaries and benefits for technologists increased 
as a percentage of service fee revenue  these costs were and in and  respectively 
recently  some of our markets have experienced a shortage of qualified radiology technologists  the personnel who operate our equipment 
if we are unable to continue to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified technologists  we will be unable to operate our centers at maximum capacity 
field supplies field supplies increased million  from million in to million in as a percentage of service fee revenue  these costs were and in and  respectively 
the increase in field supplies is primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of speciality procedures 
these procedures require supplies with a higher unit cost than typically required for other types of procedures 
field rent and lease expense field rent and lease expense decreased million  from million in to million in as a percentage of service fee revenue  these costs were and in and  respectively 
the decrease in field rent and lease expense was primarily attributable to the purchase in december of equipment previously held under operating leases 
other field expenses other field expenses decreased  from million in to million in as a percentage of service fee revenue  these costs decreased from in to in purchased billing services decreased approximately million due to i the conversion of these services to an in house billing department at one of the northeastern contracted radiology practices at the end of and ii billing services no longer provided for professional services at certain hospitals 
this was partially offset by an increase of million in service agreements on radiology equipment  and an increase in other costs of  bad debt expense bad debt expense decreased million  from million in to million in as a percentage of service fee revenue  these costs were and in and  respectively 
since service fee revenue represents contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers revenue less amounts retained by contracted radiology practices  these percentages are inherently at a higher stated value 
therefore  bad debt expense should be compared for and as a percentage of revenue of the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers  net of contractual allowances  rather than as a percentage of service fee revenue 
as a percentage of revenue of the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers  net of contractual allowances  bad debt expense was and in and  respectively 
the decrease in bad debt expense is primarily the result of terminating services performed at certain hospitals 
generally  bad debt experience with reimbursement for hospital services is at a higher percentage of revenues than the experience with reimbursement for imaging center services 
merger related costs during the third quarter of  we recorded million in merger related costs 
the charge was our share of transaction costs incurred by saunders karp megrue  lp and its affiliates in connection with the proposed merger between radiologix and skm rd acquisition corp 
the proposed merger was terminated in april supplemental incentive compensation in the fourth quarter of  upon the successful completion of a million senior notes offering  we incurred  in supplemental incentive compensation 
severance and other related costs in the fourth quarter of  we recorded  in severance and other related costs 
these costs include severance payments to our former chairman and chief executive officer and recruiting costs related to the search for a new chief executive officer 
a current independent member of the board of directors was named chairman of the board 
in february  a new president and chief executive officer was named 
in addition  in february the former president and chief operating officer resigned from his positions 
severance and other related costs will be incurred in fiscal corporate  general and administrative corporate  general and administrative expenses increased  from million in to million in as a percentage of service fee revenue  these costs were and in and  respectively 
the increase in these costs is primarily due to the further development of our infrastructure at the corporate office  including additional employees and associated employee benefits and incentive compensation 
impairment charge on long lived assets in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million impairment charge on long lived assets related to radiology equipment for of our centers in our questar operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
loss on early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a charge of million for the loss incurred on the early extinguishment of debt in relation to terminating our senior credit facility with the proceeds from our senior notes issuance in december depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million  from million in to million in as a percentage of service fee revenue  these costs were and in and  respectively 
the increase in depreciation expense is primarily attributable to the purchase of million of property and equipment for replacement  maintenance  and expansion in in addition  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is due to the purchase in december of equipment previously held under operating leases 
this is partially offset by a decrease in amortization due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
effective january  as a result  million of intangible assets  primarily related to acquired intangible assets with an indefinite lived useful life  are no longer amortized as expenses of operations  but rather carried on the balance sheet as permanent assets 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased million  from million in to million in the increase is due to higher interest costs associated with our senior notes issued in december non operating income non operating income of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of as partial consideration for early termination of management services provided at certain imaging sites not owned or operated by radiologix 
income tax expense income tax expense of million in and million in remained comparable based on a effective tax rate 
net income net income decreased from million in to million in net income as a percentage of service fee revenue was in  which decreased from in included in net income for are  net of tax benefit as an expense related to severance and other related costs and million net of tax benefit for an impairment charge for long lived assets 
included in net income for are  net of tax of non operating income offset by  net of tax benefit as an expense related to merger costs and  net of tax benefit as an expense for supplemental incentive compensation related to our senior notes offering 
in addition  net income for included a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of million net of tax benefit 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  service fee revenue the following table sets forth the amounts of revenue from the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers and the amounts retained by contracted radiology practices in thousands percent change revenue from contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers  net of contractual allowances   less amounts retained by contracted radiology practices   service fee revenue  as reported   revenue from contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers  net of contractual allowances  increased million  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to increased procedure volume  a shift in the mix to high end procedures and the addition of new reading contracts and agreements with managed care organizations 
the increase in volume growth was primarily attributable to a increase in mri procedures and a increase in ct procedures provided in imaging centers 
revenue from contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers  net of contractual allowances in  was impacted by a change in the estimation of contractual allowances of the billed charges 
generally  the change in the estimation of contractual allowances increased the contractual allowance  which decreased the revenue of the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers and therefore the service fee recognized 
amounts retained by contracted radiology practices increased from million in to million in this increase is directly attributable to the growth in revenue from contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers and the higher profitability of the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers 
the increase in revenue from contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers  net of contractual allowances offset by the increase in amounts retained by contracted radiology practices  resulted in service fee revenue increasing million  from million in to million  in costs and expenses the comparison between periods for costs and expenses discussed below as a percentage of service fee revenue is impacted by the change in the estimation of contractual allowances of the billed charges in the change in the estimation of contractual allowances increased the contractual allowance  which decreased the revenue of the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers and service fee recognized 
as a result of this change  costs and expenses as a percentage of service fee revenue will be at a higher stated value in when compared to salaries and benefits salaries and benefits increased million  from million in to million in as a percentage of service fee revenue  these costs were and in and  respectively 
field supplies field supplies increased million  from million in to million in as a percentage of service fee revenue  these costs were and in and  respectively 
the increase in field supplies is primarily attributable to an increase in volume of speciality procedures 
these procedures require supplies with a higher unit cost than typically required for other types of procedures 
field rent and lease expense field rent and lease expense increased million  from million in to million in as a percentage of service fee revenue  these costs were and in and  respectively 
the increase in these costs is primarily attributable to additional equipment operating leases entered into subsequent to fiscal other field expenses other field expenses increased million  from million in to million in as a percentage of service fee revenue  these costs were and in and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  million was recognized for the write off of a note receivable 
the note receivable was due from one of the contracted radiology practices and was determined in the fourth quarter to no longer be collectible 
as a result of the write off  we have adjusted this contracted radiology group s incentive technical bonus potential 
bad debt expense bad debt expense decreased million  from million in to million in as a percentage of service fee revenue  these costs were and in and  respectively 
since service fee revenue represents contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers revenue less amounts retained by contracted radiology practices  these percentages are inherently at a higher stated value 
therefore  bad debt expense should be compared for and as a percentage of revenue of the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers  net of contractual allowances  rather than as a percentage of service fee revenue 
as a percentage of revenue of the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers  bad debt expense was and in and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily due to a million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of for the provision of uncollectible accounts 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed an extensive review of our accounts receivable and collection experience utilizing reports and analyses not previously available 
based on this review  we believed that the estimation process of determining contractual allowances for billed charges needed to be revised and that a portion of our accounts receivable was no longer collectible 
this review allowed us to better analyze old accounts receivable  however it did not indicate what our historical collection rates would have been if the newly implemented collection policies and procedures had been in place 
accordingly  the adjustment for an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts was recognized as a bad debt expense as opposed to an increase in contractual allowances 
we recognized the million charge in the fourth quarter as a change in accounting estimate when the information became known 
merger related costs during the third quarter of  we recorded million in merger related costs 
the charge was our share of transaction costs incurred by saunders karp megrue  lp and its affiliates in connection with the proposed merger between radiologix and skm rd acquisition corp 
the proposed merger was terminated in april in the fourth quarter of  we also incurred a million charge for the write off of transaction costs incurred in connection with the proposed merger with skm 
supplemental incentive compensation in the fourth quarter of  upon the successful completion of a million senior notes offering  we incurred  in supplemental incentive compensation 
corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses increased million  from million in to million in as a percentage of service fee revenue  these costs were and in and  respectively 
the increase in these costs is primarily due to the further development of our infrastructure at the corporate office  including additional employees and associated employee benefits and incentive compensation 
loss on early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a charge of million expense for the loss incurred on the early extinguishment of debt in relation to terminating our senior credit facility with the proceeds from our senior notes issuance in december depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million  from million in to million in we have continued to buy new equipment to replace older equipment resulting in increased depreciation and amortization expense 
as a percentage of service fee revenue  these costs were and in and  respectively 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  decreased million  from million in to million in the decrease in interest expense in from was due to lower interest rates during and the pay down of outstanding debt during non operating income non operating income of million was recognized in the fourth quarter of as partial consideration for early termination of management services provided at certain imaging sites not owned or operated by the company

liquidity and capital resources liquidity for the year ended december   was derived principally from net cash proceeds from operating activities 
as of december   we had net working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
we had current assets of million and current liabilities of million  including current maturities of long term debt and capital lease obligations of million 
for the year ended december   we generated million in net operating cash flow  invested million and used cash of million in financing activities 
net cash from operating activities for the year ended december  of million increased from million for the same period in primarily due to the receipt of million in consideration of the renegotiations of service agreements with two contracted radiology practices 
this is accounted for as deferred revenue  which will be recognized in operations over approximately years 
this was partially offset by the effect of higher interest costs paid in versus accounts receivable days outstanding increased from days at december  to days at december  net cash from operating activities for the year ended december  increased million  from million in to million in the increase in cash from operating activities is primarily due to improved collections of accounts receivable which resulted in a decrease in accounts receivable days outstanding from days at december  to days at december   as well as the implementation of certain cash management strategies 
in addition  cash paid for income taxes was only million in compared to million in net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
purchases of property and equipment during the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we invested million to replace and maintain property and equipment and million in the expansion of property and equipment 
net cash flows used in financing activities for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
net cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  were million 
borrowings of long term debt for the years ended december   and were used to purchase equipment and capital improvements  as well as for working capital needs 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under our senior notes  million outstanding under our convertible subordinated junior note and an additional million in other debt obligations 
in december  we terminated our senior credit facility with proceeds from a million senior notes issuance  due december  the senior notes bear interest at an annual rate of payable semiannually in arrears on june and december of each year  and commenced june  the senior notes are redeemable on or after december  at various redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
the senior notes are unsecured obligations which rank senior in right of payment to all of our subordinated indebtedness and equal in right of payment with all other senior indebtedness 
the senior notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain restricted existing and future subsidiaries 
in addition to the senior notes issuance in december  we entered into a credit facility whereby we can borrow up to million 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility 
under the credit facility  the interest rate is i an adjusted libor rate  plus an applicable margin  which can vary from to  or ii the prime rate  plus an applicable margin  which can vary from to 
in each case  the applicable margin varies based on financial ratios maintained by us 
the credit facility includes certain restrictive covenants  including prohibitions on the payment of dividends and the maintenance of certain financial ratios including minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio  as defined 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by all service agreements to which we are a party  a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries and all of radiologix s and its wholly owned subsidiaries assets 
as of december   the contractual obligations of long term debt  including capital lease obligations and non cancelable operating leases are as follows in millions payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt   capital lease obligations    operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      in december  radiologix repurchased equipment previously held under operating leases for approximately million 
we operate in a capital intensive  high fixed cost industry that requires significant amounts of capital to fund operations  particularly the initial start up and development expense of new diagnostic imaging centers and the acquisition of additional centers and new diagnostic imaging equipment 
to the extent we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operations  funds are not available under our credit facility or we are unable to structure or obtain operating leases  we may be unable to meet our capital expenditure requirements 
furthermore  we may not be able to raise any necessary additional funds through bank financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates 
our critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how we develop our judgments about future events and related estimations and how they can impact our financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that requires our most difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to our results of operations 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be revenue recognition and estimation of contractual allowances and bad debts of accounts receivable  and evaluation of intangible and long lived asset for impairment 
revenue recognition  contractual allowances and allowances for doubtful accounts revenue of the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers is recorded when services are rendered by the contracted radiology practice and diagnostic imaging center based on established charges and reduced by estimated contractual allowances 
service fee revenue is recorded net of estimated contractual allowances and amounts retained by the contracted radiology practices under the terms of the service agreements 
we estimate contractual allowances based on the patient mix at each contracted radiology practice and diagnostic imaging center  impact of managed care contract pricing  and historical collection information 
we operate diagnostic imaging centers in different states  each of which has multiple managed care contracts and a differing patient mix 
we review monthly the estimated contractual allowance rates for each contracted radiology practice and diagnostic imaging center 
the contractual allowance rate is adjusted as changes to the factors discussed above become known 
we record bad debt expense monthly based on historical collection rates of each contracted radiology practice and diagnostic imaging center 
should circumstances change shift in payor mix  decline in economic conditions or deterioration in aging of patient receivables our estimates of the net realizable value of patient receivables could be reduced by a material amount 
bad debt expense as a percentage of the revenue from contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers  net of contractual allowances was in and in impairment of intangible and long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 became effective for us on january  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite lived useful life no longer be amortized as expenses of operations  but rather carried on the balance sheet as permanent assets 
these intangible assets are to be subject to at least annual assessments for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets amounted to million  net of tax benefit for the year ended december  these expense amounts  under sfas  are recorded on a ratable basis in years after fiscal during the first quarter we performed the initial impairment test of our questar operations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we engaged an independent third party valuation specialist to determine the fair value of these operations 
their valuation was completed in the first quarter of and indicated that the fair value of the questar operations exceeded the carrying value and consequently no impairment was recorded 
we plan to conduct our annual impairment test of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets during our first quarter of each subsequent year 
our service agreements  included in the consolidated balance sheets as intangible assets  net  are not considered to have an indefinite lived useful life and will continue to be amortized over a useful life of years 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value and lives of the finite lived intangible assets in light of any events or circumstances that we believe may indicate that the carrying amount or amortization period should be adjusted 
as of december   we do not believe there are any indicators that the carrying values or the useful lives of these assets need to be adjusted

in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this report might not occur 
risk factors an investment in our common stock or notes involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risk factors listed below  as well as the other information included or incorporated in this report  before investing in our common stock or notes 
risks related to our company and our industry our revenue is dependent on referrals 
we generate most of our revenue from fees charged for the use of our diagnostic imaging equipment at our centers 
this revenue depends on referrals from third parties  many of which are made by physicians who have no contractual relationship with us 
we also generate revenue from service fees that we receive from the contracted radiology practices 
if a sufficiently large number of physicians discontinues referring patients to us  our procedure volume could decrease  which would reduce our revenue and operating margins 
further  commercial third party payors have implemented programs to control costs that could limit the ability of physicians to refer patients to us 
for example  prepaid healthcare plans  such as health maintenance organizations  in certain instances provide diagnostic imaging services directly and contract directly with providers and require their enrollees to obtain these services from only these providers 
some insurance companies and self insured employers also limit these services to contracted providers 
these closed panel systems are now common in the managed care environment 
other systems create an economic disincentive for referrals to providers outside of the system s designated panel of providers 
we may not be able to compete successfully for managed care contracts against entities with greater resources within a market area 
changes in third party payment rates or methods for diagnostic imaging services could create downward pricing pressure  which would result in a decline in our revenue and harm our financial position 
our revenue is derived through our ownership  operation and management of diagnostic imaging centers and from service fees paid to us by contracted radiology practices 
substantially all of the revenue of our diagnostic imaging centers and the contracted radiology practices is currently derived from commercial third party payors  government sponsored healthcare programs principally  medicare and medicaid and private and other payors 
for  revenue generated at our diagnostic imaging centers consisted of from commercial third party payors  from medicare and medicaid  and from private and other payors 
rates paid by commercial third party payors are based on established physician and hospital charges and are generally higher than medicare payment rates 
any decrease in the relative number of patients covered by commercial third party payors could decrease our revenue 
any change in the rates of or conditions for reimbursement from commercial third party payors  medicare or medicaid could substantially reduce the amounts reimbursed to us or our contracted radiology practices for services provided 
these reductions could have a significant adverse effect on our revenue and financial results by creating downward pricing pressure 
we could be harmed if the contracted radiology practices terminate their agreements with us or lose a significant number of radiologists 
our diagnostic imaging services include a professional component that must be provided by radiologists who are not directly employed by us 
we do not control the radiologists who perform professional services for us 
instead  these radiologists are employed by the contracted radiology practices that maintain agreements with us 
these agreements typically have terms of between and years  but may be terminated by either party under certain limited conditions 
depending on the termination event  the radiology practice may have the right to require us to sell  assign and transfer to it  the assets and related liabilities and obligations associated with the professional and technical radiology services provided by the radiology practice immediately prior to the termination 
the termination or material modification of any of them could reduce our revenue 
if a significant number of radiologists terminate their relationships with the contracted radiology practices and the radiology practices cannot recruit sufficient qualified radiologists to fulfill practice obligations under our agreements with them  our ability to maximize the use of our diagnostic imaging centers could be adversely affected 
competition in recruiting radiologists may make it difficult for contracted radiology practices to maintain adequate levels of radiologists 
neither we nor the contracted radiology practices maintain insurance on the lives of any affiliated physicians 
we could be harmed if our texas joint venture imaging center partnerships are terminated 
five of our imaging centers in texas conduct operations through our joint ventures with a hospital company 
the term of each joint venture expires on december   with automatic one year extensions unless we or our joint venture partner give a notice to terminate 
if such a notice to terminate is given by either us or our joint venture partner  then our joint venture partner will have the option to buy our ownership interests in the joint ventures at fair market value 
although we would be compensated in the event of a buyout  our revenues and financial results could be negatively affected by a buy out unless we can deploy the capital advantageously 
we may not be able to successfully complete our market development plans 
we intend to increase our presence in existing markets through acquisitions of centers  developing de novo centers and adding additional equipment at existing centers  establishing additional joint venture and outsourcing relationships and selectively entering into contractual relationships with high quality  profitable radiology practices 
we may not be able to expand either within our existing markets or in new markets 
in addition  any expansion may not be beneficial to our overall strategy  and any such expansion may not ultimately produce returns that justify our investment 
our ability to expand is dependent upon many factors  including our ability to identify attractive and willing candidates for acquisitions  joint ventures or outsourcing relationships  adapt our structure to comply with federal and state legal requirements affecting our arrangements with contracted radiology practices  including state prohibitions on fee splitting  corporate practice of medicine and self referrals  obtain regulatory approvals and certificates of need  where necessary  and comply with licensing and certification requirements applicable to our diagnostic imaging centers  the contracted radiology practices and the physicians associated with the contracted radiology practices  recruit a sufficient number of qualified radiology technologists  expand our infrastructure and management  and obtain adequate financing 
our ability to expand is also dependent on our ability to compete for opportunities 
we may not be able to compete effectively for the acquisition of diagnostic imaging centers  joint venture opportunities or other outsourcing relationships 
our competitors may have better established operating histories and greater resources than we do 
competitors may make it more difficult to complete acquisitions or joint ventures on terms beneficial to us 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the following possible adverse effects on our operating results  diversion of management s attention and resources  failure to retain key personnel  difficulties in integrating new operations into our existing management infrastructure  amortization or write offs of acquired intangible assets  and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities 
additionally  although we will continue to structure our operations in an effort to comply with applicable antitrust laws  federal or state governmental authorities may view us as being dominant in a particular market and  therefore  cause us to divest ourselves of relationships or assets 
we and the contracted radiology practices may become subject to burdensome lawsuits 
we may be subject to professional liability claims  including  without limitation  for improper use or malfunction of our diagnostic imaging equipment 
our operations  as well as the services we provide on behalf of the contracted radiology practices  also may be subject to lawsuits for inappropriate use or disclosure of individually identifiable patient health information 
we maintain insurance policies with coverages that we believe are appropriate in light of the risks attendant to our business and consistent with industry practice 
we also require the contracted radiology practices to maintain professional liability insurance consistent with industry practice 
however  adequate liability insurance may not be available to us and the contracted radiology practices in the future at acceptable costs or at all 
providing medical services entails the risk of professional malpractice and other similar claims 
the physicians employed by the contracted radiology practices are from time to time subject to malpractice claims 
we structure our relationships with the practices under our agreements with them in a manner that we believe does not constitute the practice of medicine by us or subject us to professional malpractice claims for acts or omissions of physicians in the contracted radiology practices 
nevertheless  claims  suits or complaints relating to services provided by the contracted radiology practices may be asserted against us in the future  including malpractice 
any claim made against us not fully covered by insurance could be costly to defend against  result in a substantial damage award against us and divert the attention of our management from our operations  which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
in addition  claims might adversely affect our business or reputation 
we have assumed and succeeded to substantially all of the obligations of some of the operations that we have acquired 
therefore  claims may be asserted against us for events that occurred prior to these acquisitions 
in connection with our acquisitions  the sellers of the operations that we have acquired have agreed to indemnify us for certain claims 
however  we may not be able to collect payment under these indemnity agreements  which could affect us adversely 
most of our imaging modalities require the utilization of radiation  and certain imaging modalities utilize radioactive materials 
these operations generate regulated waste and could subject us to regulation  related costs and delays and potential liabilities for injuries or violations of environmental  health and safety laws 
most of our imaging modalities utilize radiation  and certain imaging modalities utilize radioactive material 
these operations generate medical and other regulated wastes 
storage  use and disposal of these materials and waste products present the risk of accidental environmental contamination and physical injury 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations governing storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these hazardous materials 
in the event of an accident  we would be held liable for any resulting damages  and any liability could exceed the limits of or fall outside the coverage of our insurance 
we may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms  or at all 
we could incur significant costs and the diversion of our management s attention to comply with current or future environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
we may experience competition from other diagnostic imaging companies 
this competition could adversely affect our revenue and our business 
the market for diagnostic imaging services is competitive 
we compete principally on the basis of our reputation for providing multiple modalities  our conveniently located centers and our cost effective  high quality diagnostic imaging services 
we compete locally with groups of radiologists  established hospitals  clinics and certain other independent organizations that own and operate imaging equipment 
our major national competitors include alliance imaging  inc  healthsouth corporation  insight health services corp  medical resources  inc  syncor international corporation and us diagnostic  inc 
some of our local or national competitors that provide diagnostic imaging services may now or in the future have access to greater financial resources than we do and may have access to newer  more advanced equipment 
in addition  in the past some non radiologist physician practices have refrained from establishing their own diagnostic imaging centers because of the federal physician self referral legislation 
final regulations issued in january clarify certain of the exceptions to the physician self referral legislation  which may create opportunities for and encourage some physician practices to establish their own diagnostic imaging centers within their group practices  which may compete with us 
technological change in our industry could reduce the demand for our services and require us to incur significant costs to upgrade our equipment 
technological change in the diagnostic imaging industry has been gradual 
in the future  however  the development of new technologies or refinements of existing modalities may make our existing equipment technologically or economically obsolete  or cause a reduction in the value of  or reduce the need for  our services 
diagnostic imaging equipment is currently manufactured by numerous companies 
competition among manufacturers for a greater share of the diagnostic imaging equipment market may result in technological advances in the speed and imaging capacity of new equipment 
consequently  the obsolescence of our equipment may be accelerated 
we may not have the financial ability to acquire the new or improved equipment 
a failure to meet our capital expenditure requirements could adversely affect our business 
we operate in a capital intensive  high fixed cost industry that requires significant amounts of capital to fund operations  particularly the initial start up and development expenses of new diagnostic imaging centers and the acquisition of additional centers and new diagnostic imaging equipment 
we incur capital expenditures to  among other things upgrade and replace existing equipment  purchase new diagnostic imaging equipment  and expand within our existing markets and enter new markets 
to the extent we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operations  funds are not available under our credit facility or we are unable to structure or obtain operating leases  we may be unable to meet our capital expenditure requirements 
furthermore  we may not be able to raise any necessary additional funds through bank financing or the issuance of equity or debt securities on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our success depends in part on our key personnel and we may not be able to retain sufficient qualified personnel 
our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified senior and executive management  managerial and technical personnel 
competition in recruiting these personnel may make it difficult for us to continue our growth and success 
the loss of their services or our inability in the future to attract and retain management and other key personnel could hinder the implementation of our business strategy 
we do not maintain key person insurance for any of our executive officers 
recently  there has been a shortage in certain of our markets of qualified radiology technologists  the personnel who operate our equipment 
if we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified technologists  we will be unable to operate our centers at maximum capacity 
our inability to enforce non compete agreements with the radiologists may increase competition 
each of the contracted radiology practices under our comprehensive services model has entered into agreements with its physician shareholders and full time employed radiologists that generally prohibit those shareholders and radiologists from competing for a period of two years within defined geographic regions after they cease to be owners or employees  as applicable 
in most states  a covenant not to compete will be enforced only to the extent it is necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the party seeking enforcement  if it does not unreasonably restrain the party against whom enforcement is sought  and if it is not contrary to public interest 
enforceability of a non compete covenant is determined by a court based on all of the facts and circumstances of the specific case at the time enforcement is sought 
for this reason  it is not possible to predict whether  or to what extent  a court will enforce the contracted radiology practices covenants 
the inability of the contracted radiology practices or us to enforce radiologists non compete covenants could result in increased competition from individuals who are knowledgeable about our business strategies and operations 
it is difficult to estimate our uncollectible accounts receivable and contractual allowances for billed charges  which may impact our earnings 
due to the complex nature of billing for healthcare services  it is difficult for us to estimate our uncollectible accounts receivable and our contractual allowances for billed charges 
if we have to revise our estimates and our existing reserves are not adequate  this may impact our earnings 
in late  we engaged in an extensive review of our collection processes and our method of determining allowances for contractual adjustments and bad debts 
at that time  management determined  based on reports and analyses not previously available  that the estimation process needed to be revised and that a portion of our accounts receivable were no longer collectible 
accordingly  we incurred a million pre tax charge for uncollectible accounts receivable during the fourth quarter of our ability to maximize the use of our diagnostic imaging equipment may be subject to seasonality 
during the summer months of  our average daily diagnostic imaging procedures decreased  which adversely affected our revenues during those months 
the decrease in average daily diagnostic imaging procedures may have resulted from referring physicians or their patients taking vacation 
we cannot give any assurance that our future procedure volume and revenues will not be adversely affected by similar circumstances during the summer months or other traditional vacation times of the year 
our recorded goodwill amounts may be impaired under new accounting standards 
at december   we had approximately million recorded as goodwill 
on an annual basis  we assess our recorded goodwill amounts for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
if our goodwill is impaired  we are required to record a non cash charge by writing down all or a portion of our recorded goodwill amounts 
such a write down could have a material impact on our results of operations in or future periods 
managed care contracts and capitated fee arrangements could reduce our operating margins 
during  approximately of revenue generated at our diagnostic imaging centers was derived from payments made on a fee for service basis and approximately was derived from capitated arrangements 
under capitated or other risk sharing arrangements  the healthcare provider typically is paid a pre determined amount per patient per month from the payor in exchange for providing all necessary covered services to patients covered under the arrangement 
these contracts pass much of the financial risk of providing outpatient diagnostic imaging services  including the risk of over use  from the payor to the provider 
our success will depend in part on our ability to negotiate effectively  on behalf of the contracted radiology practices and the diagnostic imaging centers that we own  operate or manage  contracts with hmos  employer groups and other third party payors for services to be provided on a risk sharing or capitated basis by some or all of the radiology practices and or diagnostic imaging centers 
risk sharing arrangements result in better revenue predictability  but more unpredictability of expenses and  consequently  profitability 
we may not be able to negotiate satisfactory arrangements on a capitated or other risk sharing basis  on behalf of our diagnostic imaging centers or the contracted radiology practices 
in addition  to the extent that patients or enrollees covered by these contracts require more frequent or extensive care than anticipated  we would incur unanticipated costs not offset by additional revenue  which would reduce operating margins 
we may be unable to generate revenue when our equipment is not operational 
timely  effective service is essential to maintaining our reputation and high utilization rates on our imaging equipment 
our warranties and maintenance contracts do not compensate us for loss of revenue when our systems are not fully operational 
equipment manufacturers may not be able to perform repairs or supply needed parts in a timely manner 
thus  if we experience more equipment malfunctions than anticipated or if we are unable to promptly obtain the service necessary to keep our equipment functioning effectively  our revenue could decline and our ability to provide services would be harmed 
our corporate organizational documents could discourage acquisition proposals and make difficult a change of control 
certain provisions of radiologix s restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  radiologix s amended and restated bylaws and delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change in control of radiologix and  consequently  limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions include the inability to remove directors except for cause and our ability to issue  without further stockholder approval  shares of preferred stock with rights and privileges senior to the common stock 
we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law which  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for three years after the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
we have also entered into employment agreements with our three executive officers  which contain provisions that require us to pay certain amounts to the executives upon their termination following a change of control 
these agreements may delay or prevent a change of control of radiologix 
risks relating to government regulation of our business state and federal anti kickback and anti self referral laws may adversely affect our income 
various federal and state laws govern financial arrangements among healthcare providers 
the federal anti kickback law prohibits the knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for  or to induce  the referral of medicare  medicaid  or other federal healthcare program patients  or in return for  or to induce  the purchase  lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare  medicaid  or other federal healthcare programs 
similarly  many state laws prohibit the solicitation  payment or receipt of remuneration in return for  or to induce the referral of patients in private as well as government programs 
violation of these anti kickback laws may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties for individuals or entities and or exclusion from federal or state healthcare programs 
we believe that we are operating in compliance with applicable law and believe that our arrangements with providers would not be found to violate the anti kickback laws 
however  these laws could be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our operations 
federal law prohibiting physician self referrals the stark law prohibits a physician from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity for certain designated health services if the physician has a prohibited financial relationship with that entity  unless an exception applies 
certain radiology services are considered designated health services under the stark law 
although we believe that our operations do not violate the stark law  our activities may be challenged 
if a challenge to our activities is successful  it could have an adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  legislation may be enacted in the future that further addresses medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse or that imposes additional requirements or burdens on us 
all of the states in which our diagnostic imaging centers are located have adopted a form of anti kickback law and almost all of those states have also adopted a form of stark law 
the scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities  each with broad discretion 
a determination of liability under the laws described in this risk factor could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions 
enforcement of federal and state privacy and associated laws may adversely affect our income 
how providers and their business associates use and disclose certain healthcare information has come under increasing public sensitivity and scrutiny 
additional risks for healthcare providers and their business associates are posed by the new hipaa federal standards which set forth guidelines concerning how individually identifiable health information may be used and disclosed 
historically  state law has governed confidentiality issues 
but as a result of the enactment of hipaa  some states are considering revisions to their existing laws and regulations 
these changes may or may not be consistent with the federal hipaa provisions 
as a provider of healthcare services  we must conform to all applicable laws  both federal and state 
we believe that our operations are compliant with these legal standards 
nevertheless  these laws and regulations are new and few have been interpreted by government regulators or courts 
consequently  our interpretations and activities may be challenged 
if a challenge to our activities is successful  it could have an adverse effect on our operations 
federal false claims act violations could affect our participation in government programs 
the federal false claims act provides  in part  that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented  or caused to be presented  a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government  or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved 
the federal false claims act further provides that a lawsuit thereunder may be initiated in the name of the united states by an individual who is an original source of the allegations 
the government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal anti kickback law or stark law may be considered a violation of the federal false claims act 
penalties include fines ranging from  to  for each false claim  plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person 
we believe that we are in compliance with the rules and regulations that apply to the federal false claims act 
however  we could be found to have violated certain rules and regulations resulting in sanctions under the federal false claims act 
if we are found in violation  any sanctions imposed could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on and exclusions from participation in federal and state healthcare programs that are integral to our business 
our agreements with the contracted radiology practices must be structured to avoid the corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting 
the laws of many states  including many of the states in which the contracted radiology practices are located  prohibit us from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians and from engaging in certain financial arrangements  such as splitting professional fees with physicians 
these laws and their interpretations vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities  each with broad discretion 
a component of our business has been to enter into service agreements with radiology practices 
we provide management  administrative  technical and other non medical services to the radiology practices in exchange for a service fee 
we structure our relationships with the radiology practices  including the purchase of diagnostic imaging centers  in a manner that we believe keeps us from engaging in the practice of medicine or exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of the radiology practices or their physicians or violating the prohibitions against fee splitting 
state regulatory authorities or other parties may assert that we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that the payment of service fees to us by the radiology practices constitutes fee splitting 
if such a claim were successfully asserted  we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and could be required to restructure or terminate the applicable contractual arrangements 
this result  or our inability to successfully restructure our relationships to comply with these statutes  could jeopardize our business strategy 
licensing and certification laws may limit our ability to expand 
ownership  construction  operation  expansion and acquisition of diagnostic imaging centers are subject to various federal and state laws  regulations and approvals concerning licensing of centers  personnel  certificates of need and other required certificates for certain types of healthcare centers and major medical equipment 
the laws of some of the states in which we operate limit our ability to acquire new diagnostic imaging equipment or expand or replace our existing equipment at diagnostic imaging centers in those states 
in addition  free standing diagnostic imaging centers that provide services that are not performed as part of a physician office must meet medicare requirements to be certified as an independent diagnostic testing facility to bill the medicare and medicaid programs 
we may not be able to receive the required regulatory approvals for any future acquisitions  expansions or replacements  and the failure to obtain these approvals could limit the market for our services 
the regulatory framework is uncertain and evolving 
healthcare laws and regulations may change significantly in the future 
we continuously monitor these developments and modify our operations from time to time as the regulatory environment changes 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to adapt our operations to address new regulations or that new regulations will not adversely affect our business 
in addition  although we believe that we are operating in compliance with applicable federal and state laws  neither our current or anticipated business operations nor the operations of the contracted radiology practices have been the subject of judicial or regulatory interpretation 
we cannot assure you that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations 
certain states have enacted statutes or adopted regulations affecting risk assumption in the healthcare industry  including statutes and regulations that subject any physician or physician network engaged in risk based managed care contracting to applicable insurance laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations may require physicians and physician networks to meet minimum capital requirements and other safety and soundness requirements 
implementing additional regulations or compliance requirements could result in substantial costs to us and the contracted radiology practices and limits our ability to enter into capitated or other risk sharing managed care arrangements 
risks related to notes our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations on our notes or notes issued to replace them 
at december   we had approximately million of indebtedness 
in addition  we have the ability to borrow up to million under our credit facility 
also  subject to restrictions in the indenture and the credit facility  we may incur additional indebtedness 
our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our notes and our other indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes  all of the indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and will mature prior to any notes  our high level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt  some of our debt has a variable rate of interest  which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates  and our high level of indebtedness makes us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
we expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses and to pay the amounts due under our notes and other debt from our operations and from borrowings under our credit facility 
our ability to meet our expenses thus depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic and other factors 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future  our currently anticipated growth in revenue and cash flow may not be realized on schedule and future borrowings may not be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay indebtedness  including our notes  or to fund other liquidity needs 
if we do not have enough money  we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt including our notes  sell assets or borrow more money 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt agreements  including our credit facility and any indenture  may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives 
the failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to achieve these alternatives could significantly adversely affect the value of our notes and our ability to pay the amounts due under them 
because our notes are unsecured  the right to enforce remedies is limited by the rights of holders of secured debt 
our notes are not secured 
our credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and a pledge of the capital stock of all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
if we become insolvent or are liquidated  or if any payment under the credit facility is accelerated  our lenders will be entitled to exercise the remedies available to a secured lender under applicable law and will have a claim on those assets before the holders of any notes 
the liquidation value of our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full any indebtedness under the credit facility  as well as our other indebtedness  including our notes 
our ability to repay our notes and our other debt depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries  some of which are not obligated to make funds available to make payments on notes 
radiologix is a holding company 
its only material assets are its ownership interests in its subsidiaries 
consequently  it depends on distributions or other intercompany transfers of funds from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other obligations  including with respect to its notes 
our non guarantor subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available for payment on our notes 
only our subsidiaries that are not unrestricted subsidiaries will guarantee our notes 
the financial statements included in this report are presented on a consolidated basis  including all of our subsidiaries 
the aggregate total assets at december  of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors of our notes were million  or of our total assets at december  the operating results of our guarantor subsidiaries may not be sufficient to enable us to make payments on our notes 
in addition  our rights and the rights of our creditors  including holders of our notes  to participate in the assets of any of our non guarantor subsidiaries upon their liquidation or recapitalization will generally be subject to the prior claims of those subsidiaries creditors 
as a result  our notes are effectively subordinated to the indebtedness of the non guarantor subsidiaries 
as of december   the total liabilities of our non guarantor subsidiaries  excluding intercompany liabilities  were million 
the indenture for our notes and our credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions  which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions 
the indenture for our notes and our credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions limit our ability to  among other things borrow money  pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase our stock  make investments  create liens  sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies  enter into certain transaction with affiliates  sell stock in our subsidiaries  and restrict dividends  distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries 
in addition  our senior credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
these covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and pursue available business opportunities 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness 
if a default occurs  the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness 
acceleration of our other indebtedness could result in a default under the terms of the indentures governing our notes and our assets may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness  including our notes 
a court could cancel the guarantees under certain circumstances 
each of our subsidiaries that is not an unrestricted subsidiary guarantees our notes 
if  however  a guarantor becomes a debtor in a case under the united states bankruptcy code or encounters other financial difficulty  under federal or state fraudulent conveyance laws a court might avoid that is  cancel its guarantee 
the court might do so if it found that  when the guarantor entered into its guarantee or  in some states  when payments became due under its guarantee  it i received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the guarantee and ii either a was or was rendered insolvent  b was left with inadequate capital to conduct its business  or c believed or should have believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay 
the court might also avoid a guarantee  without regard to the above factors  if it found that the guarantor entered into its guarantee with actual intent to hinder  delay  or defraud its creditors 
a court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee unless it benefited directly or indirectly from the issuance of our notes 
if a court avoided a guarantee  a note holder would no longer have a claim against the guarantor 
in addition  the court might direct a note holder to repay any amounts already received from the guarantor 
if the court were to avoid any guarantor s guarantee  we cannot assure a note holder that funds would be available to pay our notes from another guarantor or from any other source 
the test for determining solvency for purposes of the foregoing will depend on the law of the jurisdiction being applied 
in general  a court would consider an entity insolvent either if the sum of its existing debts exceeds the fair value of all its property  or if the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts as they become due 
for this analysis  debts includes contingent and unliquidated debts 
the indenture states that the liability of each guarantor on its guarantee is limited to the maximum amount that the subsidiary can incur without risk that the guarantee will be subject to avoidance as a fraudulent conveyance 
this limitation may not protect the guarantees from a fraudulent conveyance attack or  if it does  that the guarantees will be in amounts sufficient  if necessary  to pay obligations under our notes when due 
we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to holders of our notes upon a change of control 
upon the occurrence of a change of control  as defined in our indenture  a note holder will have the right to require us to purchase our notes at a price equal to of the principal amount  together with any accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any  to the date of purchase 
our failure to purchase  or give notice of purchase of  our notes would be a default under the indenture  which would in turn be a default under our senior credit facility 
moreover  our failure to repay all amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility upon a default would also be a default under the indenture 
in addition  a change of control may constitute an event of default under our credit facility 
a default under our credit facility will result in an event of default under the indenture if the lenders accelerate the debt under our senior credit facility 
if a change of control occurs  we may not have enough assets to satisfy all obligations under our credit facility and the indenture related to our notes 
upon the occurrence of a change of control  we could seek to refinance the indebtedness under our credit facility and our notes or obtain a waiver from the lenders or the note holders 
we may not be able to obtain a waiver or refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
no established trading market exists for our notes  and note holders may not be able to sell them quickly or at the price that note holders paid 
we do not intend to list our notes on any securities exchange or to arrange for quotation on any automated dealer quotation system 
we expect that our notes will be designated for trading in the portal market 
jefferies company  inc and deutsche banc alex brown make a market in the notes  but they are not obligated to do so 
they may discontinue any market making at any time  in their sole discretion 
as a result  we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any trading market for the notes 
note holders may not be able to sell notes at a particular time or at favorable prices 
we also cannot assure note holders as to the level of liquidity of the trading market for the notes 
as a result  note holders may be required to bear the financial risk of their investment in the notes indefinitely 
future trading prices of the notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors  including our operating performance and financial condition  the interest of securities dealers in making a market for our notes  and the market for similar securities
