overview pervasive software is a leading worldwide provider of embedded data management solutions and services to support the development  deployment and management of mission critical business applications 
our high performance  flexible database  pervasive 
sql  is widely installed with more than million server seats licensed to date 
pervasive 
sql offers advanced data management technology combined with a very low total cost of ownership tco  resulting in an average to improvement over another competitor s database  according to a june aberdeen group study 
our sophisticated database replication technology  pervasive dataexchange  offers targeted solutions to data movement and synchronization problems like maintaining an offsite warm backup  driving transactional data into a data portal  and connecting remote databases 
with pervasive 
sql and pervasive dataexchange  independent software vendors isvs can create sophisticated yet low maintenance business applications that reach far beyond the desktop to easily share information from workstations to the web 
in addition  we recently extended our product line with our data security product  pervasive auditmaster 
pervasive auditmaster provides a new level of security for business applications by monitoring and reporting all activity occurring in a pervasive 
sql database  leveraging deep level capture  report and alert technology to enable meticulous monitoring of mission critical data without the high costs of application redevelopment and deployment  training  or on going maintenance 
our software products are designed for integration by isvs into client server  web and mobile applications  sold to small to mid size enterprises smes  which typically have environments with little to no information technology it infrastructure and require self tuning  low administration products 
as a result  end users can concentrate on running their businesses instead of managing the data management solutions underlying their applications  which is particularly critical to this large market 
we derive our revenues primarily from shrink wrap licenses through isvs  value added resellers vars and distributors and through original equipment manufacturer oem license agreements with isvs 
shrink wrap license fees are variable and based generally on user count 
our oem licensing program offers isvs volume discounts and specialized technical support  training and consulting in exchange for embedding our products in software applications and paying us a royalty based on sales of their applications 
additionally  we generate revenues from version upgrades  user count upgrades  upgrades to new or additional platforms  and from upgrades to client server or web environments from single user workstation or workgroup environments 
historically  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from our pervasive 
sql data management products 
the latest release of pervasive 
sql  v  was released in december our future operating results will depend upon continued market acceptance of pervasive 
sql 
any decrease in demand or market acceptance for our pervasive 
sql product would have a damaging effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in july  we announced a restructuring to focus on our core database management business  including the discontinuation of our tango product line 
in june  we completed the sale of the tango technology 
we recorded tango as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements  therefore  the following discussion and analysis refer only to continuing operations 
as part of the july restructuring  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees  or approximately of our worldwide workforce 
the majority of the reductions occurred in our toronto office and our austin headquarters 
the workforce reduction was primarily related to the discontinuance of our tango 
table of contents 
index to financial statements product line  however  we also reduced a portion of our pervasive 
sql related workforce  mostly in our pervasive 
sql development organization 
in june  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees  or approximately of our worldwide workforce  to further improve profitability and as a precautionary measure in light of the continued uncertain economic environment 
the reduction resulted in a non recurring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year of million  including a charge for the workforce reduction and related charges for idle leased facilities and certain intangible assets 
in july  we formed a new business venture with ag tech corporation  a company developing  selling and importing packaged software  to sell and support our products in japan 
ag tech has been engaged in the sales and support of btrieve predecessor to pervasive 
sql and pervasive 
sql products since in conjunction with the joint venture  ag tech launched a new operating division staffed with specialists experienced in selling and supporting pervasive 
sql to assume responsibility for oem sales  packaged software sales  technical support and localization and translation of our products into japanese 
the new business venture has resulted in improved profitability on sales in japan as the arrangement allowed us to significantly reduce our costs in japan 
in connection with the new business venture  we obtained a less than ownership interest in ag tech and the ability to elect one director to the ag tech board of directors 
pervasive s revenues from japan were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies revenue recognition sales returns and bad debt reserves revenue recognition we license our software through oem license agreements with software developers  or isvs  and through shrink wrap software licenses  sold through isvs  value added resellers  or vars  systems integrators and distributors 
revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenues related to oem license agreements involving nonrefundable fixed minimum license fees are generally recognized upon delivery of the product master or first copy if no significant vendor obligations remain 
per copy royalties related to oem license agreements in excess of a fixed minimum amount are recognized as revenue when such amounts are reported to us 
we generally provide telephone support to customers and end users in the days immediately following the sale at no additional charge and at a minimal cost per call 
we accrue the cost of providing this support 
revenue from training is recognized when the related services are performed 
we enter into agreements with certain distributors that provide for certain stock rotation and price protection rights 
these rights allow the distributor to return products in a non cash exchange for other products or for credits against future purchases 
revenue from shipping and handling is recognized at the shipping date 
shipping and handling costs are included in costs of revenue and technical support in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements sales returns and bad debt reserves we reserve for the cost of estimated sales returns  stock rotation and price protection rights as well as uncollectible accounts based on experience 
subsequent event on august   we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire privately held data junction corporation  a pioneering data and application integration company based in austin  texas  for up to million in cash and million shares of our common stock 
the agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of pervasive and data junction and is subject to the approval of the shareholders of both companies 
the acquisition is expected to close in the fourth calendar quarter of we filed a registration statement on form s on september  to register the shares of our common stock to be issued to the data junction shareholders in connection with the merger 
the registration statement contains detailed descriptions of the merger  the merger agreement  data junction and its products  and the risk factors associated with the merger and the combined company 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of revenues represented by certain lines in our consolidated statements of operations

table of contents 
index to financial statements general softening in the packaged client server applications market  contributing to decreased orders for our pervasive 
sql products embedded in these applications  as well as a change in the discount structure in japan following the formation of our new business venture in july we believe each of the above factors could continue to negatively affect license revenues for pervasive 
sql in the future 
the increase in revenue from continuing operations in fiscal year can be attributed to upgrades to our latest release of pervasive 
sql  v  released in december  and improved sales and marketing execution following management changes made at the beginning of fiscal licenses of our software operating on windows nt or other microsoft operating systems continue to represent approximately to of our revenues 
we expect that the percentages of our revenues attributable to licenses of our software operating on particular platforms will continue to change from time to time 
we cannot be certain that our revenues attributable to licenses of our software operating on windows nt  or any other operating system platform  will grow in the future 
international revenues  consisting of all revenues from continuing operations from customers located outside of north america  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
we attribute the decrease in international revenue in fiscal year to competitive pressures and what we believe to have been a general softening in the packaged client server applications market  contributing to decreased orders for our pervasive 
sql products embedded in these applications 
the decrease in fiscal year can also be attributed to a change in the discount structure in japan following the formation of our new business venture in july we believe each of the above factors could continue to negatively affect international license revenues for pervasive 
sql in the future 
we attribute the increase in international revenue in fiscal year to improved sales and marketing execution following management changes made at the beginning of fiscal year we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the future 
costs and expenses cost of revenues and technical support 
cost of revenues and technical support consists primarily of the cost to manufacture and fulfill orders for our shrink wrap software products  the cost to provide technical support  primarily telephone support which is typically provided within days of purchase  and license fees for third party technologies embedded in our products 
cost of revenues and technical support for continuing operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing   and of revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
cost of revenues and technical support decreased in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of a reduction in costs associated with technical support and training personnel following our reduction in force in june and the formation of our new business venture in japan  as well as reduced license fees for third party technology embedded in or bundled with our product 
cost of revenues and technical support decreased in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of a reduction in cost associated with consulting personnel 
we anticipate that cost of revenues and technical support will be consistent in dollar amount in the near term  primarily as a result of the continued effect of the reduction in costs associated with technical support and training personnel following our reduction in force in june  the formation of our new business venture in japan in july  reduced license fees for third party technology in  and a reduction in cost associated with consulting personnel in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  foreign sales office expenses  travel and entertainment  marketing programs and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal primarily due to reduced costs associated with sales and marketing personnel following our reduction in force in june and the formation of our new business venture 
table of contents 
index to financial statements in japan in july sales and marketing expenses increased in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal primarily due to increased costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and costs associated with marketing programs and promotional expenses related to the launch of the latest release of pervasive 
sql  v  during the second quarter of fiscal we expect sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount in the near term  primarily as a result of the timing and extent of product market development activities and costs associated with new product releases  marketing promotions  brand awareness campaigns and partner programs 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs 
research and development expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
research and development costs decreased in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal primarily due to reduced costs associated with research and development personnel following our reduction in force in june and the formation of our new business venture in japan in july research and development costs increased in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal primarily due to increased costs associated with research and development personnel and outsourced development contracts 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will be consistent in dollar amount in the near term as a result of the continued effect of the increase in costs associated with research and development personnel and outsourced development contracts 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel salaries and other costs of our finance  human resources and administrative departments 
general and administrative expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal relates primarily to reduced costs associated with general and administrative personnel following our reduction in force in june and the formation of our new business venture in japan in july general and administrative expenses decreased in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal primarily due to reductions in general and administrative personnel  bad debt expense and fees paid to professional service providers 
we believe our general and administrative expenses will decrease in dollar amount in the near term as a result of reduced costs associated with general and administrative personnel and fees paid to professional service providers 
business restructuring charge 
business restructuring charges in fiscal consist of charges related to our reduction in workforce in june and related charges for idle leased facilities and certain intangible assets 
we incurred a non recurring charge of approximately million in fiscal  representing of revenues from continuing operations 
the business restructuring was initiated to further improve profitability and as a precautionary measure in light of the continued uncertain economic environment 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes related to continuing operations was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we recorded a tax provision for fiscal related to taxes on our foreign operations  despite our consolidated operating loss for the year 
we recorded a tax provision for fiscal and fiscal related to taxes on our foreign operations  despite the availability of substantial domestic net operating loss carryforwards 
based on a number of factors  we believe it is more likely than not  that a substantial amount of our deferred tax assets may not be realized 
these factors include annual trends in revenue related to continuing operations  the potential impact of anticipated deductions due to exercise of outstanding employee stock options on deferred tax assets with limited carryforward periods  and the intensely competitive market in which we operate  which is subject to rapid change 

table of contents 
index to financial statements accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset due to uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets based on the lack of substantial earnings history 
we expect to continue to incur foreign taxes associated with our international operations while our domestic income taxes will remain minimal as we utilize substantial net operating losses carried forward from previous years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our provision for income taxes 
effect of adoption of new accounting principle 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective july  statement discontinues the amortization of goodwill and requires future periodic testing of goodwill for impairment 
in addition  statement requires reassessment of the useful lives of previously recognized intangible assets 
with the adoption of statement  we ceased amortization of goodwill as of july  the adoption will result in a decrease in operating expense related to goodwill amortization of approximately  per year 
additionally  we completed a goodwill impairment test as allowed by statement during the first quarter of fiscal  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately  which is recorded as a cumulative change in accounting principle 
gain from discontinued operations 
gain from discontinued operations in fiscal was million and is the result of the sale of the tango technology in june  as well as a reduction in the estimated future liabilities of the discontinued tango operations 
gain from discontinued operations in fiscal was million and is the result of a reduction in the future liabilities of the discontinued tango operations following the partial termination of an office lease on favorable economic terms

effect of adoption of new accounting principle income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations gain on disposal gain from discontinued operations net income loss our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors 
such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
we establish our expenditure levels based on expectations as to future revenue  and  if revenue levels are below expectations  expenses can be disproportionately high 
as a result  a drop in near term demand for our products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter 
in the future  our operating results may fluctuate for this reason or as a result of a number of other factors  including increased expenses  timing of product releases  increased competition  variations in the mix of sales  announcements of new products by us or our competitors and capital spending patterns of our customers 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly basis 
see risk factors that may affect future results 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by continuing operations was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by continuing operations from fiscal to resulted primarily from the increase in earnings from continuing operations in fiscal  a decrease in current assets and an increase in deferred revenue  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash provided by continuing operations decreased from fiscal to despite an increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in current assets  partially offset by an increase in deferred rent and lease related accruals

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and requires a guarantor to make disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   and the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we believe that adoption of fin will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we have provided the required disclosures in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  fasb issued statement  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
statement amends fasb statement  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
finally  statement amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
since we are continuing to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method under apb no

fin requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other interests in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or

this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under statement this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   except for the provisions that relate to statement implementation issues that have been effective for quarters that began prior to june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  we believe that adoption of statement will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of our operations are based in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have operations in japan  germany  france  england  belgium and poland and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in revenue and operating loss of approximately million and  respectively 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in revenue and operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in revenue and operating income of approximately  if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in operating loss of approximately million 
if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in operating income of approximately million 
the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of all other currencies for fiscal  and was not material 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure and  from time to time  will attempt to reduce exposure through hedging 
gains and losses on foreign currency hedging were not material to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended june   and as such hedging activities were minimal 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our cash and marketable securities investments  however  this risk is limited as our investment policy requires us to invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less
