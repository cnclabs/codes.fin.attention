we may not update these forward looking statements  even if our situation changes in the future 
all forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements 
we are one of the leading worldwide independent providers of turnkey manufacturing services to oems in the automotive  computing and storage  consumer products  instrumentation and medical  networking  peripherals and telecommunications industries 
the historical growth of the overall ems industry  which subsided in early to mid consistent with the overall global economic downturn  was driven by the increasing number of oems who were outsourcing their manufacturing requirements 
we anticipate that this industry outsourcing trend will continue during the next several years 
we derive most of our net revenue under purchase orders from oem customers 
we recognize revenue  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and recoverability is reasonably assured 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to several factors  including variation in demand for our customers products  our customers attempts to manage their inventory  electronic design changes  changes in our customers manufacturing strategies  and acquisitions of or consolidations among our 
table of contents customers 
demand for our customers products depends on  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services  we are responsible for procuring components and other materials 
this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product 
we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue  and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue 
our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor and selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating margins 
as our capacity has grown during recent years through the construction of new greenfield facilities  the expansion of existing facilities and our acquisition of additional facilities  our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased to support this growth 
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design  production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 
to support this effort  our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers 
most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue 
in addition  our engineers engage in r d of new technologies that apply generally to our operations 
the expenses of these r d activities are reflected in the research and development line item in our consolidated financial statements 
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities 
the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in us dollars  while our labor and utility costs in plants outside the united states are denominated in local currencies 
we hedge these local currency costs  based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge  through the purchase of foreign exchange contracts 
changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are included in other comprehensive income 
see factors affecting future results we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations and note n summary of significant accounting policies comprehensive income to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our large customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see factors affecting future results because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sales to any one of our 
table of contents customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue and note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions and expansion the ems industry experienced rapid growth over a period of years until mid  when the industry s revenue declined as a result of significant cutbacks in its customers production requirements  which was consistent with the overall global economic downturn 
nonetheless  oems have continued to turn to outsourcing in order to reduce product cost  achieve accelerated time to market and time to volume production  access advanced design and manufacturing technologies  improve inventory management and purchasing power  and reduce their capital investment in manufacturing 
we believe  therefore  that additional acquisition opportunities exist and we regularly evaluate such acquisition opportunities 
we also evaluate acquisition opportunities that may arise as a result of consolidation in the ems industry 
we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions of ancillary services to compliment our service offerings 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate or  if consummated  successfully integrate the operations and management of any such acquisitions 
acquisitions involve significant risks  which could have a material adverse effect on us  including financial risks  such as potential liabilities of the acquired businesses  costs associated with integrating acquired operations and businesses  the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the financial impact of valuing goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any acquisitions  potential future impairment write downs of goodwill and the amortization of other intangible assets  possible adverse tax and accounting effects  and the risk that we spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenue or that we may have to close facilities at our cost 
operating risks  such as the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the businesses to be acquired  the risk that the acquired businesses will fail to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided  the need to implement financial and other systems and add management resources  the risk that key employees of the acquired businesses will leave after the acquisition  unforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations  and the impact on us of any unionized work force we may acquire or any labor disruptions that might occur 
we have made a number of acquisitions that were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition 
see factors affecting future results we may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions 
for further discussion of our acquisitions  see note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal year  we completed construction of and commenced operations in our new manufacturing facility in huangpu  china 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates 
table of contents used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers 
this allowance is based on management s assessment of specific customer balances  considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer 
if there is an adverse change in the financial condition of our customers  or if actual defaults are higher than provided for  an addition to the allowance may be necessary 
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage and other lower of cost or market considerations 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional valuation adjustments may be necessary 
long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations as a result of a change in our business strategy 
we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill  principally based on third party valuations  in connection with material business acquisitions 
estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows 
the allocation of amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts allocable to goodwill 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which we early adopted effective september   we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
we completed the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
the impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level  which we have determined to be consistent with our operating segments as defined in note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 
the impairment analysis is based on assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections at the reporting unit level 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand  and the restructuring of our operations as a result of a change in our business strategy 
restructuring and impairment charges we recognized restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years  and related to reductions in workforce  re sizing and closure of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites 
these charges were recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management 
the recognition of restructuring and impairment charges required that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with these 
table of contents plans 
the estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring additional restructuring and impairment charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs 
for further discussion of our restructuring programs  refer to note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operation restructuring and impairment charges 
pension and postretirement benefits we have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities  which are developed from actuarial valuations 
actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates on discount rates and return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data 
the discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
this rate is required to represent the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
when considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we take into account current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets 
other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
see note pension and other postretirement benefits to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense

our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to a increase in production of consumer products  an increase in production of instrumentation and medical products  a increase in production of automotive products  a increase in production of computing and storage products and a increase in production of networking products due to the addition of new customers  acquisitions and organic growth in those sectors 
the increase in the consumer products sector was primarily due to the acquisition of certain operations of philips during fiscal year these increases were offset in part by an decrease in production of telecommunications products due to reduced demand in this sector 
foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in foreign source revenue was primarily attributable to incremental revenue resulting from our acquisitions in france and scotland during late fiscal year  and our acquisitions in austria  brazil  belgium  china  hungary  india  japan  malaysia  mexico  poland and singapore during fiscal year we currently anticipate that our foreign source revenue will continue to increase as a percentage of our total net revenue 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased slightly to in fiscal year from in fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in the portion of manufacturing based revenue and the mix of value add based revenue from our acquisitions  partially offset by cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities

see note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and impairment charges 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we initiated a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with customer geographic requirements 
this restructuring program resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million for fiscal year these restructuring and impairment charges included cash costs totaling million consisting of employee severance and benefits costs of approximately million  costs related to lease commitments of approximately million and other restructuring costs of million 
non cash costs of approximately million represent fixed asset impairment charges related to our restructuring activities 
as of august   liabilities of million related to these restructuring activities are expected to be paid out within the next twelve months and liabilities of million are expected to be paid out through august  the employee severance and benefit costs included in our restructuring and impairment costs recorded in fiscal year are related to the elimination of approximately  employees  the majority of which were engaged in direct and indirect manufacturing activities in manufacturing facilities in the united states and europe 
lease commitment costs consisted primarily of future lease payments for facilities vacated because of the closure and consolidation of facilities in the united states 
the fixed asset impairment charge resulted from the closure of our boise  idaho and coventry  england facilities  as well as a realignment of our worldwide capacity due to the restructuring activities carried out during fiscal year the production from the boise location was transferred to other existing locations during fiscal year the transfer of production from the coventry location began during the second quarter of fiscal year and was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year for additional information regarding restructuring costs  see note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the restructuring activities completed through may   we realized a cumulative cost savings of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the restructuring activities completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year are expected to contribute an additional million to our cumulative quarterly cost savings 
therefore  we expect to realize cost savings of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal year and each quarter thereafter 
the cumulative quarterly cost savings consists of million reduction in cost of revenue due to a reduction in employee payroll and benefit expense of million and million in depreciation expense  and million reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year reflecting lower interest yields on cash deposits and short term investments 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities during the year  imputed interest related to the philips acquisitions and the issuance of the million  seven year

income taxes 
we recognized an effective income tax benefit of in fiscal year  as compared to an effective income tax rate of in fiscal year the tax rate is a function of the mix of the effective tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which our restructuring charges were incurred  and the mix of domestic versus international income from operations 
the amount of restructuring charges recorded during fiscal year  and the fact that the income taxes associated with the restructuring charges were calculated using the effective tax rates in the jurisdictions in which those charges were incurred  resulted in an income tax benefit 
in addition  as the proportion of our income derived from foreign sources has increased  our effective tax rate has decreased as our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the united states  primarily due to tax holidays granted to our sites in malaysia  china and hungary that expire at various dates through such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue decreased to billion for fiscal year  down from billion in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in production of computing and storage products  a decrease in production of peripheral products and a decrease in production of networking products due to softening demand in those sectors 
these decreases were offset in part by and increases in production of instrumentation and medical and consumer products  respectively  due to the addition of new customers and organic growth in those sectors 
foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of revenue for fiscal year the increase in foreign source revenue was primarily attributable to incremental revenue resulting from our acquisitions in england  france  italy  malaysia and scotland 
the percentage of foreign source revenue also increased as a result of the current economic conditions in the us as our overall revenue has fallen  our us based revenues have decreased proportionally more than the decreases in the asian  latin american and european markets 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in the portion of manufacturing based revenue and due to cost reductions realized from our restructuring activities during fiscal years and selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue in fiscal year from million of net revenue in fiscal year the increase in dollar amount was primarily attributable to locations acquired in late fiscal year and fiscal year and to a full year s operations in facilities that were under construction or starting production during fiscal year the increase as a percentage of net revenue was impacted by the increase in absolute dollars as well as by decreased revenues in fiscal year r d 
r d expenses in fiscal year increased to million from million in fiscal year but remained at of net revenue for each of the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
despite the adverse economic conditions during fiscal year that negatively impacted the demand for our services  we continued to engage in r d activities  including design of circuit board assemblies and the related production process  development of new products and new failure analysis techniques at our historical levels 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year this increase was attributable to acquired amortizable intangible assets arising from our acquisitions in england and italy during late fiscal year and in france  malaysia  scotland and the united states during fiscal year we elected to early adopt sfas  effective the beginning of fiscal year in accordance with sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill for fiscal year for additional information regarding

restructuring and impairment charges 
during fiscal year  we incurred million in restructuring charges related to reductions in our cost structure 
these charges included reductions in workforce  re sizing of facilities and the transition of certain facilities into new customer development sites 
these charges were largely intended to align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipated customer demand 
approximately million related to asset write off costs  million to lease exit costs  million to employee severance and termination benefit costs and million in other restructuring costs 
the employee severance and benefit termination costs included in our restructuring charges were related to the elimination of approximately  employees during fiscal year the majority of these employees were engaged in direct and indirect manufacturing activities in various facilities around the world 
costs related to lease commitments consisted primarily of future lease payments for facilities vacated as a result of the consolidation of facilities 
the fixed asset impairment charge primarily resulted from a decision made to vacate several smaller facilities in the united states  europe and asia due to adverse macroeconomic conditions 
for additional information regarding restructuring costs  see note restructuring and impairment charges to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income 
interest income increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year reflecting increased income on greater cash balances resulting from positive cash flow from operations during fiscal year and the proceeds from our issuance of convertible notes completed in the third quarter of fiscal year interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of our issuance of convertible notes near the end of the third quarter of fiscal year and imputed interest on deferred acquisition payments related to the marconi acquisition 
income taxes 
in fiscal year  our effective tax rate decreased to from in fiscal year the tax rate is predominantly a function of the mix of domestic versus international income from operations 
as the proportion of our income derived from foreign sources has increased  our effective tax rate has decreased as our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the united states  primarily due to tax holidays granted to our sites in malaysia  china and hungary that expire through such tax holidays are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply 
in addition to the increase in foreign source income  the effective tax rate for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year decreased due to the mix of the effective tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which our restructuring and acquisition related charges were incurred and the tax treatment of the amortization of intangibles in each jurisdiction

the amended revolver requires compliance with several financial covenants including a fixed charge coverage ratio  consolidated net worth threshold and indebtedness to ebitda ratio  as defined in the amended revolver 
the amended revolver requires compliance with certain operating covenants  which limit  among other things  our incurrence of additional indebtedness 
we were in compliance with the respective covenants as of august  as of august   there were no borrowings outstanding on the amended revolver 
on november   we negotiated a day  million line of credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
a equity interest in a foreign subsidiary was pledged to secure repayment of the facility 
the terms of the line of credit agreement mirrored the terms of the revolver described above 
the day facility was to expire on november  at the time we entered into the amended revolver on july   we terminated this line of credit facility 
on may   we negotiated a six month  billion japanese yen jpy approximately million based on currency exchange rates at the time credit facility for a japanese subsidiary with a japanese bank 
under the terms of the credit facility  interest accrued on outstanding borrowings based on the tokyo interbank offered rate tibor plus a spread of 
the credit facility was to expire on december  and any outstanding borrowings would then be due and payable 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we borrowed billion jpy on this facility 
the cash proceeds  which translated to million based on foreign currency rates in effect at the date of the borrowing  were used to partially fund the acquisition of certain operations of nec in gotemba  japan 
on august   we renegotiated the billion jpy credit facility by converting it into a five year term loan japan term loan  with the final principal payment due may  we pay interest on the japan term loan quarterly at a fixed annual rate of 
the japan term loan requires quarterly repayments of principal 
table of contents of million jpy beginning may  the japan term loan requires compliance with financial and operating covenants including maintaining a minimum equity balance at the respective subsidiary level 
we were in compliance with the respective covenants as of august  on may   we negotiated a six month  billion jpy approximately million based on currency exchange rates at the time credit facility for a japanese subsidiary with a japanese bank 
under the terms of the facility  we pay interest on outstanding borrowings based on tibor plus a spread of 
the credit facility expires on december  and any outstanding borrowings are then due and payable 
we plan to renew this facility in the first quarter of fiscal year as of august   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
on june   we paid the remaining million outstanding balance of the million  senior notes we originally issued in may that were scheduled to mature in may during fiscal year and early fiscal year  we had an accounts receivable securitization program that provided for the sale of up to million of eligible accounts receivables of certain us plants 
we allowed the program to expire in may our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through greenfield growth or acquisitions 
it is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash 
future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments  changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment 
we currently believe that during the next twelve months  our capital expenditures will be approximately million  principally for machinery  equipment  facilities and related expenses 
we believe that our level of resources  which include cash on hand  available borrowings under our amended revolver  and funds provided by operations  will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures and our working capital requirements for the next twelve months 
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities  our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our amended revolver or access public or private debt and equity markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable 
our contractual obligations for short and long term debt arrangements  future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements and other long term obligations as of august  are summarized below 
we do not participate in  or secure financing for any unconsolidated limited purpose entities 
non cancelable purchase commitments do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most 
purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable 
payments due by period in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years notes payable  long term debt and long term lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents factors affecting future results our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors  including adverse changes in general economic conditions  the level and timing of customer orders  the level of capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and associated fixed costs  the composition of the costs of revenue between materials  labor and manufacturing overhead  price competition  our level of experience in manufacturing a particular product  the degree of automation used in our assembly process  the efficiencies achieved in managing inventories and fixed assets  fluctuations in materials costs and availability of materials  and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements and shortages of components or labor 
the volume and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to variation in demand for our customers products  our customers attempts to manage their inventory  electronic design changes  changes in our customers manufacturing strategies  and acquisitions of or consolidations among our customers 
in the past  changes in customer orders have had a significant effect on our results of operations due to corresponding changes in the level of our overhead absorption 
any one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our annual and quarterly results of operations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation quarterly results 
because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue 
for the fiscal year ended august   our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our net revenue and customers accounted for over of our net revenue 
for the fiscal year ended august   cisco  philips and hp accounted for approximately  and of our net revenue  respectively 
we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth  viability and financial stability 
our customers industries have experienced rapid technological change  shortening of product life cycles  consolidation  and pricing and margin pressures 
consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of manufacturing services ordered from us 
the industry s revenue declined in mid as a result of significant cut backs in its customers production requirements  which was consistent with the overall global economic downturn 
we cannot assure you that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly change  reduce or delay the amount of manufacturing services ordered from us 
if they do  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  we generate significant account receivables in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers 
if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for the manufacturing services provided by us  our operating results and financial condition would be 
table of contents adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and business customers and marketing 
our customers may be adversely affected by rapid technological change 
our customers compete in markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products and services 
these conditions frequently result in short product life cycles 
our success will depend largely on the success achieved by our customers in developing and marketing their products 
if technologies or standards supported by our customers products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we depend on industries that utilize electronics components  which includes the telecommunications industry  which continually produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles  our inability to continually manufacture such products on a cost effective basis would harm our business 
factors affecting the industries that utilize electronics components in general could seriously harm our customers and  as a result  us 
these factors include the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards  which result in short product life cycles  the inability of our customers to develop and market their products  some of which are new and untested  the potential that our customers products may become obsolete or the failure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance  and recessionary periods in our customers markets 
if any of these factors materialize  our business would suffer 
in addition  if we are unable to offer technologically advanced  cost effective  quick response manufacturing service to customers  demand for our services will also decline 
a substantial portion of our net revenue is derived from our offering of complete service solutions for our customers 
for example  if we fail to maintain high quality design and engineering services  our net revenue may significantly decline 
most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules  which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency of our manufacturing capacity 
the volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers products  our customers attempts to manage their inventory  electronic design changes  changes in our customers manufacturing strategy  and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers 
due in part to these factors  most of our customers do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter in advance 
our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity 
in the past  we have been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of our customers 
anticipated orders from many of our customers have  in the past  failed to materialize or delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in our customers business needs  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
on other occasions  our customers have required rapid increases in production  which have placed an excessive burden on our resources 
such customer order fluctuations and deferrals have had a material adverse effect on us in the past  and we may experience such effects in the future 
in addition  the current business environment resulting from uncertainties 
table of contents relating to economic recession has made planning even more complex 
a business downturn resulting from any of these external factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and business backlog 
our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production 
ems providers must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for their customers 
we generally do not obtain firm  long term purchase commitments from our customers and we continue to experience reduced lead times in customer orders 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons 
the success of our customers products in the market affects our business 
cancellations  reductions or delay by a significant customer or by a group of customers could negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  component procurement commitments  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimate of customer requirements 
the short term nature of our customers commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers 
on occasion  customers may require rapid increases in production  which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins 
in addition  because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross profits and operating results 
we compete with numerous ems providers and others  including our current and potential customers who may decide to manufacture all of their products internally 
the ems business is highly competitive 
we compete against numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers  including celestica  inc  flextronics international  sanmina sci corporation and solectron corporation 
in addition  we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronic manufacturers that are selling  or may begin to sell  ems 
most of our competitors have international operations  significant financial resources and some have substantially greater manufacturing  r d  and marketing resources than us 
these competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  have greater name recognition  critical mass and geographic market presence  be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities  adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements  devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their services  and be better positioned to compete on price for their services 
we also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers  who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing to ems providers 
in addition  in recent years  odms  companies that provide design and manufacturing services to oems  have significantly increased their share of outsourced manufacturing services provided to oems in several markets  such as notebook and desktop computers  personal computer motherboards  and consumer electronic products 
competition from odms  such as hon hai precision industry co  ltd  may increase if our business in these markets grows or if odms expand further into or beyond these markets 
see business competition 
increased competition may result in decreased demand or prices for our services 
the ems industry is highly competitive 
we compete against numerous us and foreign ems providers with global operations  as well as those who operate on a local or regional basis 
in addition  
table of contents current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally 
some of our competitors have substantially greater managerial  manufacturing  engineering  technical  systems  r d  sales and marketing resources than we do 
consolidation in the ems industry results in larger and more geographically diverse competitors who have significant combined resources with which to compete against us 
we may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers  distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide 
as a result  competitors may procure a competitive advantage and obtain business from our customers 
our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection  and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us 
we also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services  to reduce their current products or service sales prices and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing 
any of these could cause a decline in sales  loss of market acceptance of our products or services  profit margin compression  or loss of market share 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations  which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations 
we derived of revenues from international operations in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year we expect our revenues from international operations to continue to increase 
we currently operate outside the united states in vienna  austria  bruges  brussels and hasselt  belgium  belo horizonte  manaus and sao paulo  brazil  huangpu  panyu  shanghai and shenzhen  china  coventry  england  brest and meung sur loire  france  szombathely and tiszaujvaros  hungary  pimpri  india  dublin  ireland  bergamo and marcianise  italy  gotemba  japan  penang  malaysia  chihuahua  guadalajara and reynosa  mexico  kwidzyn  poland  ayr and livingston  scotland  and singapore city  singapore 
we continually consider additional opportunities to make foreign acquisitions and construct new foreign facilities 
our international operations may be subject to a number of risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws  longer customer payment cycles and difficulty collecting accounts receivable export duties  import controls and trade barriers including quotas  governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the united states  burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could affect local payroll  utility and other expenses  and inability to utilize net operating losses incurred by our foreign operations against future income in the same jurisdiction 
in addition  several of the countries where we operate have emerging or developing economies  which may be subject to greater currency volatility  negative growth  high inflation  limited availability of foreign exchange and other risks 
these factors may harm our results of operations  and any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our international operations may not be effective 
in our experience  entry into new international markets requires considerable management time as well as start up expenses for market development  hiring and establishing office facilities before any significant revenues are generated 
as a result  initial operations in a new market may 
table of contents operate at low margins or may be unprofitable 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources 
if we do not manage our growth effectively  our profitability could decline 
we have grown rapidly 
our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  continue to develop the management skills of our managers and supervisors  and continue to train  motivate and manage our employees 
our failure to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
see selected consolidated financial data and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
we may not achieve expected profitability from our acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations and management of our recent acquisitions 
similarly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate or  if consummated  successfully integrate the operations and management of future acquisitions 
acquisitions involve significant risks  which could have a material adverse effect on us  including financial risks  such as potential liabilities of the acquired businesses  costs associated with integrating acquired operations and businesses  the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the financial impact of valuing goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any acquisitions  potential future impairment write downs of goodwill and the amortization of other intangible assets  possible adverse tax and accounting effects  and the risk that we spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenue or that we may have to close facilities at our cost 
operating risks  such as the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the businesses to be acquired  the risk that the acquired businesses will fail to maintain the quality of services that we have historically provided  the need to implement financial and other systems and add management resources  the risk that key employees of the acquired businesses will leave after the acquisition  unforeseen difficulties in the acquired operations  and the impact on us of any unionized work force we may acquire or any labor disruptions that might occur 
we have acquired and will continue to pursue the acquisition of manufacturing and supply chain management operations from oems 
in these acquisitions  the divesting oem will typically enter a supply arrangement with the acquiror 
therefore  the competition for these acquisitions is intense 
in addition  certain oems may not choose to consummate these acquisitions with us because of our current supply arrangements with other oems 
if we are unable to attract and consummate some of these acquisition opportunities  our growth could be adversely impacted 
arrangements entered into with divesting oems typically involve many risks  including the following the integration into our business of the acquired assets and facilities may be time consuming and costly  we  rather than the divesting oem  may bear the risk of excess capacity  we may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies  we may be unable to meet the expectations of the oem as to volume  product quality  timeliness and cost reductions  and if demand for the oem s products declines  the oem may reduce its volume of purchases  and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other oems 

table of contents as a result of these and other risks  we may be unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under these arrangements  and they may not result in any material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings 
our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the outsourcing opportunities associated with these acquisitions is subject to risks  including our ability to meet volume  product quality  timeliness and pricing requirements  and our ability to achieve the oems expected cost reduction 
in addition  when acquiring manufacturing operations  we may receive limited commitments to firm production schedules 
accordingly  in these circumstances  we may spend substantial amounts purchasing these manufacturing facilities and assume significant contractual and other obligations with no guaranteed levels of revenues 
we may also not achieve expected profitability from these arrangements 
as a result of these and other risks  these outsourcing opportunities may not be profitable 
we face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations 
over the past few years  we have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations with the intention of improving utilization and realizing cost savings in the future 
these initiatives have included changing the number and location of our production facilities  largely to align our capacity and infrastructure with current and anticipated customer demand 
this alignment includes transferring programs from higher cost geographies to lower cost geographies 
the process of restructuring entails  among other activities  moving production between facilities  reducing staff levels  realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management 
we continue to evaluate our operations and may need to undertake additional restructuring initiatives in the future 
if we incur additional restructuring related charges  our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes 
a shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profits 
substantially all of our net revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing in which we provide materials procurement 
while most of our significant long term customer contracts permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors  we may bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re pricings or  if such re pricing is not permitted  during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract 
accordingly  certain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins 
almost all of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are available from only a single source 
some of these components are allocated from time to time in response to supply shortages 
in some cases  supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component 
in addition  at various times industry wide shortages of electronic components have occurred  particularly of memory and logic devices 
such circumstances have produced insignificant levels of short term interruption of our operations  but could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and business components procurement 
we may not be able to maintain our engineering  technological and manufacturing process expertise 
the markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development 
the continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to hire  retain and expand our qualified engineering and technical personnel  maintain technological leadership  develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs  and 
table of contents successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations use the assembly and testing technologies  equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers  we cannot be certain that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future 
the emergence of new technology  industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment  inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive 
the acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense or capital investment  which could reduce our operating margins and our operating results 
in facilities that we establish or acquire  we may not be able to maintain our engineering  technological and manufacturing process expertise 
our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers changing technological needs and requirements or to maintain our engineering  technological and manufacturing expertise  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we manufacture products containing design or manufacturing defects  or if our manufacturing processes do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements  demand for our services may decline and we may be subject to liability claims 
we manufacture and design products to our customers specifications  and  in some cases  our manufacturing processes and facilities may need to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements 
for example  medical devices that we manufacture or design  as well as the facilities and manufacturing processes that we use to produce them  are regulated by the food and drug administration 
similarly  items we manufacture for customers in defense and aerospace industries  as well as the processes we use to produce them  are regulated by the department of defense and the federal aviation authority 
in addition  our customers products and the manufacturing processes that we use to produce them often are highly complex 
as a result  products that we manufacture may at times contain manufacturing or design defects  and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements 
defects in the products we manufacture or design  whether caused by a design  manufacturing or component failure or error  or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes  may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders 
if these defects or deficiencies are significant  our business reputation may also be damaged 
the failure of the products that we manufacture or our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements may subject us to legal fines or penalties and  in some cases  require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing process or facility 
in addition  these defects may result in liability claims against us or expose us to liability to pay for the recall of a product 
the magnitude of such claims may increase as we expand our medical  automotive  and aerospace and defense manufacturing services  as defects in medical devices  automotive components  and aerospace and defense systems could kill or seriously harm users of these products and others 
even if our customers are responsible for the defects  they may not  or may not have resources to  assume responsibility for any costs or liabilities arising from these defects 
our increasing design services offerings may increase our exposure to product liability  intellectual property infringement and other claims 
we have increased our efforts to offer certain design services  primarily those relating to products that we manufacture for our customers 
providing such services can expose us to different or greater potential liabilities than those we face from providing our regular manufacturing services 
historically  we have generally not agreed in our customer contracts to be liable for product design defects 
however  with the growth of our design services business  we are assuming some of those risks 
as a result  we have increasing exposure to potential product liability claims resulting from injuries resulting from defects in products we design  as well as potential claims that products we design infringe on third parties intellectual property 
such claims could subject us to significant liability for damages and  regardless of their merits  could be time consuming and expensive to resolve 
we also may have greater potential 
table of contents exposure with respect to products we design that may be recalled due to product problems 
costs associated with possible product liability claims  intellectual property infringement claims and product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
any delay in the implementation of our information systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs 
we have completed the installation of an enterprise resource planning system in sixteen of our manufacturing sites and in our corporate location 
we are in the process of installing this system in certain of our remaining plants  which will replace the current manufacturing resource planning system  and financial information systems 
any delay in the implementation of these information systems could result in material adverse consequences  including disruption of operations  loss of information and unanticipated increases in cost 
compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process 
if we fail to comply with any present and future regulations  we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment  or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
certain of our existing stockholders have significant control 
as of august   our executive officers  directors and certain of their family members collectively beneficially own of our outstanding common stock  of which william d 
morean  our chairman of the board  beneficially owns 
as a result  our executive officers  directors and certain of their family members have significant influence over the election of our board of directors  the approval or disapproval of any other matters requiring stockholder approval  and the affairs and policies of jabil 
we are subject to the risk of increased taxes 
we base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities 
our tax position  however  is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law 
we cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes 
several countries in which we are located allow for tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business 
we have obtained holidays or other incentives where available 
our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are retracted  or if they are not renewed upon expiration  or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 
in addition  further acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase 
our credit rating is subject to change 
our credit is rated by credit rating agencies 
for example  our senior notes were rated baa by moody s investor service  which is considered investment grade debt and bb by standard and poor s rating service  which is considered one level below investment grade debt 
if in the future our credit rating is downgraded so that neither credit rating agency rates our senior notes as investment grade debt  such a downgrade may increase our cost of capital should we borrow under our revolving credit facilities  may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future on 
table of contents terms that are acceptable to us or at all  may negatively impact the price of our common stock and may have other negative implications on our business  many of which are beyond our control 
we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations 
a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in exchange rates among other currencies and the us dollar will affect our cost of sales  operating margins and revenues 
we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations 
we use financial instruments  primarily forward purchase contracts  to hedge us dollar and other currency commitments arising from trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations 
if these hedging activities are not successful or we change or reduce these hedging activities in the future  we may experience significant unexpected expenses from fluctuations in exchange rates 
an adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition 
we pay interest on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and other long term debt obligations at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates 
an adverse change in the base rates upon which our interest rates are determined could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are exposed to intangible asset risk 
we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill  in connection with business acquisitions 
we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at least on an annual basis and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
as a result of our annual and other periodic evaluations  we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values  which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position 
consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components may adversely affect our business 
in the current economic climate  consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components may further increase as companies combine to achieve further economies of scale and other synergies 
consolidation in industries that utilize electronics components could result in an increase in excess manufacturing capacity as companies seek to divest manufacturing operations or eliminate duplicative product lines 
excess manufacturing capacity has increased  and may continue to increase  pricing and competitive pressures for the ems industry as a whole and for us in particular 
consolidation could also result in an increasing number of very large companies offering products in multiple industry sectors 
the significant purchasing power and market power of these large companies could increase pricing and competitive pressures for us 
if one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide services and has its own production facilities or relies on another provider of similar services  we may lose that customer s business 
such consolidation among our customers may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenues and exposes us to increased risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers 
any of the foregoing results of industry consolidation could adversely affect our business 
customer relationships with emerging companies may present more risks than with established companies 
customer relationships with emerging companies present special risks because such companies do not have an extensive product history 
as a result  there is less demonstration of market acceptance of their products making it harder for us to anticipate needs and requirements than with established customers 
also  due to the current economic environment  additional funding for such companies may be more difficult to obtain and these customer relationships may not continue or materialize to the extent we plan or we previously experienced 
this tightening of financing for start up customers  together with many start 
table of contents up customers lack of prior earnings and unproven product markets increase our credit risk  especially in accounts receivable and inventories 
although we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust our reserves for accounts receivable and inventories for all customers  including start up customers  based on the information available  these reserves may not be adequate 
this risk exists for any new emerging company customers in the future 
our stock price may be volatile 
our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future  based on a variety of factors  including future announcements covering us or our key customers or competitors  government regulations  litigation  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  fluctuations in quarterly operating results  or general conditions in the ems  automotive  computing and storage  consumer products  instrumentation and medical  networking  peripherals and telecommunications industries 
furthermore  stock prices for many companies  and high technology companies in particular  fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results 
those fluctuations and general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions or international currency fluctuations and demand for our services  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law may have certain anti takeover effects 
the corporation law of the state of delaware and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each contain certain provisions that may  in effect  discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of jabil or unsolicited acquisition proposals from taking place
