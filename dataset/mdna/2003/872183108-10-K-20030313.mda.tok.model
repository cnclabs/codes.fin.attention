item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations compared to the company has two operating segments retail and wholesale 
the retail segment includes the franchised retail tire business conducted by big o tires  inc  as well as the operation of retail tire and service centers by tire kingdom  inc the wholesale segment markets and distributes the company s proprietary brands of tires  as well as other tires and related products  on a wholesale basis to distributors who resell to or operate independent tire dealers 
net sales for increased from the level  due principally to the combined effects of a gain in total unit tire volume  a increase in the average tire sales price and greater service revenues in company operated retail tire outlets 
in comparison  unit tire shipments for the us replacement tire industry as a whole declined approximately during based on preliminary data 
the percentage of total company sales attributable to tires was in compared to in net sales by the company s retail segment increased compared to the level  including a increase in unit tire volume  a increase in the average retail tire sales price and the previously mentioned increase in service revenues 
sales by the retail segment were favorably affected by an increase in the number of company operated and franchised stores in the company s retail systems 
at the end of  the company had a total of stores in its two retail systems compared to stores at december  net sales by the wholesale segment increased over the level  due principally to a increase in unit tire sales and a increase in average tire sales prices 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in the improved overall gross profit percentage was largely due to the increased contribution from the retail segment 
in addition  the company s increased overall unit volume led to greater purchasing leverage with suppliers and a resulting improvement in net purchase prices 
gross margin percentages on sales by the company s retail segment increased to in from in  while wholesale margins were in compared to in distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in increases in total sales helped to leverage the company s warehousing and product delivery costs  since many of them  such as rent  do not vary in relation to sales 
selling  administrative and retail store expenses increased million in compared to  due principally to a greater number of company operated retail stores 
expenses for such retail stores include payroll  operating and service related costs  in addition to certain other selling and administrative expenses 
expenses in included amortization of goodwill and trademarks of million 
no amortization of such assets was recorded in  under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 which was adopted by the company on january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
expenses in also included  related to the writeoff of a prepaid pension asset 
excluding the impact of the amortization and pension charge in the prior year and the expenses associated with the new stores  selling  administrative and retail store expenses increased only in compared to the level  while net sales excluding the new stores increased 

table of contents net interest expense decreased million in compared to level  due principally to the combined effects of lower overall borrowing rates and lower average borrowings 
the company s average borrowing rate in was approximately lower than in  which was a reflection of lower market interest rates as well as efforts by the company to better manage receivables  inventories and other key components of working capital and thereby minimize interest rate spreads under its borrowing agreements 
average borrowings declined from the level  principally as a result of cash generated from operations and the above mentioned management efforts which allowed the company to reduce its debt to banks and other lenders 
net interest expense in included interest income of  related to refunds on amended tax returns filed in prior years 
net other income in was  less than in  due primarily to a decline in interest and service charge income from customers as well as a decrease in the company s equity in operating results from joint ventures 
the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in the lower effective rate in was due to reduced provisions for state income taxes as well as the impact of sfas no 
 since the majority of goodwill amortized in prior years was not deductible for tax purposes 
earnings per diluted share were in and in earnings per diluted share in included a charge of as a result of the previously noted writeoff of a prepaid pension asset and a credit of related to interest on prior year amended tax returns  in addition to the approximate charge related to the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets prior to the adoption of sfas no 
excluding the effects of these items  earnings in would have been approximately per diluted share 
compared to as a result of the company s acquisition of tire kingdom  inc tire kingdom in june see note to the consolidated financial statements  there were a number of significant changes in income statement items between the years and  since results in only included tire kingdom for the seven months following the acquisition 
net sales for increased from the level  due principally to the combined effects of a increase in the average tire sales price and a gain in unit tire volume 
the increased unit tire volume was due principally to the inclusion of tire units sold by tire kingdom during all of the increase in the average tire sales price was due to the increased proportion of sales attributable to retail  as well as the effect of industry price increases during net sales also benefited from the inclusion of revenue from mechanical and maintenance services performed by tire kingdom s retail stores during the entire year of the revenue from such services  which is included in non tire sales  caused the percentage of total sales attributable to tires to shift from in to in excluding the impact of tire kingdom  unit tire volume declined compared to the level  while the average tire sales price increased 
the decline in unit tire volume after excluding tire kingdom was largely reflective of a fluctuation in industry demand from year to year 
demand in was greater than normal  due to certain recalls within the industry and because of strong purchasing activity in the fourth quarter in advance of announced industry price increases effective january  industry demand in was affected somewhat by the overall general economic slowdown during the last half of the year 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in  due primarily to the significantly increased proportion of sales attributable to the retail segment 
gross margin percentages on sales by the company s retail segment increased from in to in  due principally to the inclusion of tire kingdom for the full year in wholesale margins were relatively unchanged  at in compared to in 
table of contents distribution expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in  due largely to the inclusion of tire kingdom for the entire year in as an operator of retail stores  tire kingdom generally experiences lower warehousing and product delivery costs as a percentage of its sales than the company experiences on sales to its other customers 
the company also benefited in from improved operating efficiencies by its wholesale segment  which led to reduced warehousing and product delivery expenses as a percentage of sales 
selling  administrative and retail store expenses increased million in compared to  due principally to the inclusion of tire kingdom s expenses for the full year of and to a greater number of retail stores in operation 
in addition  an increase in market development expenses and store conversion costs in conjunction with the expansion of the company s franchised retail system caused expenses in to be greater than in expenses for the retail segment  particularly those associated with the operation of the company s own retail stores  are substantially higher as a percentage of sales than for the wholesale segment 
expenses of a non recurring nature included a charge of  in related to the writeoff of a prepaid pension asset and a charge of approximately million in related to certain severance and management restructuring 
net interest expense in declined  from the level and included lower average borrowing rates and higher average borrowing levels 
in addition  the net expense in included interest income of  related to refunds on amended tax returns filed in prior years 
the higher average borrowings during were principally associated with the borrowings made to fund the tire kingdom acquisition in june the structure of the company s borrowing agreements was changed as a result of the acquisition to include somewhat higher interest rate spreads based upon the company s leverage ratio 
this change led to a decline in total average borrowing rates in  even though market interest rates experienced a much sharper decrease compared to net other income in was  greater than in  due in part to improved results from real estate transactions associated with franchised store development and to increased interest and service charge income from customers 
the company s effective tax rate was relatively unchanged  at in compared to in earnings per diluted share in totaled and included a charge of as a result of the previously noted writeoff of a prepaid pension asset and a credit of related to interest on prior year amended tax returns 
earnings per diluted share in totaled and included a net charge of as a result of the previously noted management restructuring expenses 
excluding the effects of these items  earnings were as reported in compared to per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of million at december   relatively unchanged from million at the end of the company s current ratio was at the end of both and in january  the company entered into a borrowing agreement with a group of banks which included an million  three year revolving loan facility and an million  five year term loan 
at december   million was borrowed under the bank revolving loan facility and million was outstanding under the bank term loan 
the company s long term debt at the end of also included million in senior notes 
of the total million borrowed at december  under these credit arrangements  million was classified as current on the company s balance sheet and the remaining million was considered noncurrent 
the company is subject to certain financial covenants and other restrictions under its agreements with the respective lenders see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company was in compliance with all of its borrowing covenants as of december  and for the year then ended 
the current revolving loan facility is scheduled to expire in january the company began discussions with lenders in early to restructure its borrowing agreements  to provide financial resources to help meet the company s capital needs as it plans for continued future growth 

table of contents cash generated by operations  together with the available credit arrangements  enabled the company to fund capital expenditures totaling million in  as well as the purchase of the net assets of certain retail tire stores for million 
additionally  the company was able to reduce its total funded debt by a total of million during and fund repurchases of common stock totaling million 
as of december   the company had an unused authorization from the board of directors for the repurchase of  additional shares of common stock 
capital expenditures in and were primarily for equipment and tire molds 
the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures at the end of the company expects to fund day to day operating expenses and normally recurring capital expenditures out of operating funds and its present financial resources 
the company believes that the combination of its bank borrowing facilities and expected funds from operations will be sufficient to operate on both a short term and long term basis 
in  management s strong emphasis on managing working capital and the balance sheet resulted in cash from operations of over million 
accounts receivable and inventory turnover both improved significantly in compared to the rates 
the company was able to reduce its investment in franchise stores under development included in other current assets on the balance sheet by million compared to the december  level 
the balance in other noncurrent assets was also significantly reduced  primarily as a result of collections of noncurrent notes receivable 
the company expects its future growth to include additional strategic acquisitions such as the june acquisition of tire kingdom 
it is likely that at least one such acquisition will be made in significant future acquisitions could require additional capital resources and would involve new or amended credit facilities

certain inventories are valued using the last in first out method 
revenue recognition sales are recognized upon shipment of products 
estimated costs of returns  allowances and customer rebates are accrued at the time products are shipped

long lived assets the company periodically reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets 
if facts or circumstances support the possibility of impairment  the company will prepare a projection of the undiscounted future cash flows of the specific assets and determine if the assigned value is recoverable or if an adjustment to the carrying value of the assets is necessary

if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is required to be recognized 
no impairment to the recorded value of company s indefinite lived assets was found to exist as a result of the required testing

forward looking statements and risks this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities act of  as amended  including  without limitation  statements containing the words believes  expects  anticipates  estimates and words of similar import 
such forward looking statements relate to expectations for future financial performance  which involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors 
such factors include  but are not limited to changes in economic and business conditions in the world  increased competitive activity  consolidation within and among both competitors  suppliers and customers  unexpected changes in the replacement tire market  the company s inability to attract as many new franchisees or open as many company operated retail outlets as planned  changes in the company s ability to identify and acquire additional companies in the replacement tire industry and the failure to achieve synergies or savings anticipated in such acquisitions  fluctuations in tire prices charged by manufacturers  including fluctuations due to changes in raw material and energy prices  product shortages and supply disruptions  changes in interest and foreign exchange rates  the cyclical nature of the automotive industry and the loss of a major customer or program 
it is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors 
any forward looking statements in this report are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the company in light of its experience and perception of historical trends  current conditions  expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances 
such statements are not a guarantee of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain financial market risks 
the most predominant of these risks is the fluctuation in interest rates associated with bank borrowings  since changes in interest expense affect the company s operating results 
at december   the company owed million to banks under its credit facilities  of which million was not hedged by interest rate swap agreements and was thus subject to market risk for a change in interest rates 
if interest rates increase by basis points  the company s annual interest expense would increase by approximately  based on the outstanding balance which was not hedged at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company s interest rate swap agreements 
the company has no significant foreign currency translation risks  since its sales to customers located outside the united states are made and settled in us dollars
