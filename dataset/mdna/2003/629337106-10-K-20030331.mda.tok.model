item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result s of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
historical operating results and percentage relationships among any amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicativ e of trends in operating results for any future period 
cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the priva te securities litigation reform act of the company wishes to caution readers that this report contains  and future filings by the company  press releases and oral statements made by the company s authorized representatives may contain  forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
readers can identify these forward looking statements by the use of such verbs as expects  anticipates  believes or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements due to important factors bearing on the company s business  many of which already have been discussed in this filing and in the company s prior filings 
the differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including  but not limited to  the risk factors described below 
you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties  and all other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this annual report or form k  before making an investment in our common stock 
an y of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
in such case  the trading price of ou r common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the demand for our products is cyclical  which could adversely impact our revenues 
the end markets for fully assembled bearings are cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production 
as a result  the market for bearing components is also cyclical and impacted by overall levels of industrial production 
our sales in the past have been negatively affected  and in the future will be negatively affected  by adverse conditions in the industrial production sector of the economy or by adverse global or national economic conditions generally 
we depend on a very limited number of foreign sources for our primary raw material and are subject to risks of shortages and price fluctuati on 
the steel that we use to manufacture precision balls and rollers is of an extremely high quality and is available from a limited number of producers o n a global basis 
due to quality constraints in the us steel industry  we obtai n substantially all of the steel used in our us ball and roller production from overseas suppliers 
in addition  we obtain substantially all of the steel used in our european ball production from a single european source 
if we had to obtain steel from sources other than our current suppliers  particularly in the case of our european operations  we could face higher prices and transportation costs  increased duties or taxes  and shortages of steel 
problems in obtaining steel  and particularly chrome steel  in the quantities that we require and on commercially reasonable terms  could increase our costs  negatively impact our ability to operate our business efficiently and have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of our company 
we operate in and sell products to customers outside the us and are subject to several related risks 
because we obtain a majority of our raw materials from overseas suppliers  actively participate in overseas manufacturing operations and sell t o a large number of international customers  we face risks associated with the following o adverse foreign currency fluctuations  o changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations  and other activities of governments  agencies and similar organizations  o the imposition of trade restrictions or prohibitions  o high tax rates that discourage the repatriation of funds to the us  o the imposition of import or other duties or taxes  and o unstable governments or legal systems in countries in which our suppliers  manufacturing operations  and customers are located 
we do not have a hedging program in place associated with consolidating the operating results of our foreign businesses into us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar and or the euro relative to other currencies may adversely affect our ability to compete with our foreign based competitors for international  as well as domestic  sales 
also  a decline in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar will negatively impact our consolidated financial results  which are denominated in us dollars 
in addition  due to the typical slower summer manufacturing season in europe  we expect that revenues in the third fiscal quarter will reflect lower sales  as our sales to european customers have increased as a percentage of net sales 
we depend heavily on a relatively limited number of customers  and the loss of any major customer would have a material adverse effect on our business 
sales to various us and foreign divisions of skf  which is one of th e largest bearing manufacturers in the world  accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales in  and sales to ina fag accounted for approximatel y of consolidated net sales in during  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales 
none of our othe r customers individually accounted for more than of our consolidated net sales for the loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to these customers would cause us to lose a substantial portion of our revenue and would lower our profit margin and cash flows from operations 
the costs and difficulties of integrating acquired business could impede our future growth 
we cannot assure you that any future acquisition will enhance our financial performance 
our ability to effectively integrate any future acquisitions will depend on  among other things  the adequacy of our implementation plans  the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operatin g efficiencies and sales goals 
the integration of any acquired businesses might cause us to incur unforeseen costs  which would lower our profit margin and future earnings and would prevent us from realizing the expected benefits of these acquisitions 
we may not be able to continue to make the acquisitions necessary for us to realize our growth strategy 
acquiring businesses that complement or expand our operations has been and continues to be an important element of our business strategy 
this strateg y calls for growth through acquisitions constituting approximately two thirds of our future growth  with the remainder resulting from internal growth and market penetration 
we bought our plastic bearing component business in  formed euroball with our two largest bearing customers  skf and ina fag  in and acquired our bearing seal operations in during  we purchased ina fag s minority interest in euroball 
see note of the notes to consolidate d financial statements 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing acquisitions on favorable terms in the future 
in addition  we may borrow funds to acquire othe r businesses  increasing our interest expense and debt levels 
our inability to acquire businesses  or to operate them profitably once acquired  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  skf  the minority shareholder in euroball  has the righ t to require us to purchase its interest beginning in january skf has informed us that it intends to exercise its right and we expectt to purchase it s interest in the second quarter of the company may need to borrow funds to pay for all or a portion of the purchase of skf s interest or may be required t o make a purchase at a time that is less favorable to the company 
our growth strategy depends on outsourcing  and if the industry trend toward outsourcing does not continue  our business could be adversely affected 
our growth strategy depends in significant part on major bearing manufacturers continuing to outsource components  and expanding the number of components being outsourced 
this requires manufacturers to depart significantl y from their traditional methods of operations 
if major bearing manufacturers do not continue to expand outsourcing efforts or determine to reduce their use of outsourcing  our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely affected 
our market is highly competitive and many of our competitors have significant advantages that could adversely affect our business 
the global market for bearing components is highly competitive  with a majority of production represented by the captive production operations of certain large bearing manufacturers and the balance represented by independent manufacturers 
captive manufacturers make components for internal use and for sale to third parties 
all of the captive manufacturers  and many independent manufacturers  are significantly larger and have greater resources than do we 
our competitors are continuously exploring and implementing improvements in technology and manufacturing processes in order to improve product quality  and our ability to remain competitive will depend  among other things  on whether w e are able to keep pace with such quality improvements in a cost effective manner the production capacity we have added over the last several years has at times resulted in our having more capacity than we need  causing our operating costs to be higher than expected 
we have expanded our ball and roller production facilities and capacity over the last several years 
during  we built an additional manufacturing plant in kilkenny  ireland  and we continued this expansion in through the formation of euroball with skf and ina fag 
our ball and rolle r facilities have not always operated at full capacity and from time to time our results of operations have been adversely affected by the under utilization of our production facilities  and we face risks of further under utilization or inefficient utilization of our production facilities in future years 
the price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations and may decline 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are o our operating and financial performance and prospects  o quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators  such as earnings per share  net income and revenues  o changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts  o loss of any member of our senior management team  o speculation in the press or investment community  o strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  o sales of our common stock by stockholders  o general market conditions  and o domestic and international economic  legal and regulatory factor s unrelated to our performance 
the stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as delaware corporate law  contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorabl e and may prevent you from receiving a takeover premium for your shares 
these provisions include  for example  a classified board of directors and the authorization of our board of directors to issue up to  preferred shares without a stockholder vote 
in addition  our restated certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders may not call a special meeting 
we are a delaware corporation subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  an anti takeover law 
generally  this statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which such person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner a business combination includes a merger  asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder 
we anticipate that the provisions of section may encourage parties interested in acquiring us to negotiate in advance with our board of directors  because the stockholder approval requirement would be avoided if a majority of the directors then in office approve either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder 
these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 
if a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented  the market price of our common stock could decline 
overview the company s core business is the manufacture and sale of high quality  precision steel balls and rollers 
in  sales of balls and rollers accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales with and of sales from balls and rollers  respectively 
sales of precision molded plasti c and rubber parts accounted for the remaining 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
since the company was formed in it has grown primarily through th e displacement of captive ball manufacturing operations of domestic and international bearing manufacturers resulting in increased sales of high precision balls for quiet bearing applications

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgment underlying them  are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition  inventory valuation  asset impairment recognition  business combination accounting and pension and postretirement benefits 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not significantly differ from the estimates used in these critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable are due primarily from the core served markets bearing manufacturers  automotive industry  electronics  industrial  agricultural and aerospace 
due to the chapter voluntary bankruptcy of one imc customer and other write offs  the company experienced million of bad debt expense during versus million during in establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  the company continuously performs credit evaluations of its customers  considering numerous inputs when available including the customers financial position  pas t payment history  relevant industry trends  cash flows  management capability  historical loss experience and economic conditions and prospects 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that the company could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
the company s inventories are not generally subject to obsolescence due to spoilage or expiring product life cycles 
the company operates generally as a make to order business  however  th e company also stocks products for certain customers in order to meet delivery schedules 
while management believes that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements  the company could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
acquisitions and acquired intangibles 
for new acquisitions  the company uses estimates  assumptions and appraisals to allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and to determine the amount of goodwill 
these estimates are based on market analyses and comparisons to similar assets 
annual tests are required to be performed to assess whether recorded goodwill is impaired 
the annual tests require management to make estimates and assumptions with regard t o the future operations of its reporting units  the expected cash flows that they will generate  and their market value 
these estimates and assumptions therefor e impact the recorded value of assets acquired in a business combination  including goodwill  and whether or not there is any subsequent impairment of th e recorded goodwill and the amount of such impairment 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets include property  plant and equipment 
the recoverability of the long term assets is dependent on the performance of the companies which the company has acquired  a s well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these acquisitions 
in assessing potential impairment for these assets the company will consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance 
for assets held for sale  appraisals are relied upon to assess the fair market value of those assets 
future adverse changes in market conditions or adverse operating results of the underlying assets could result in the company having to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
pension and post retirement obligations 
the company uses several assumptions i n determining its periodic pension and post retirement expense and obligations which are included in the consolidated financial statements 
these assumptions include determining an appropriate discount rate  rate of compensation increase as well as the remaining service period of active employees 
the company uses a n independent actuary to calculate the periodic pension and post retirement expense and obligations based upon these assumptions and actual employee census data

additional working capital and capital expenditure financing are provided for under the facility 
amounts outstanding under the facilities accrue interest at a floating rate equal to euribor at december  plus an applicable margin of between to based upon calculated financial ratios 
the loan agreemen t contains various restrictive financial and non financial covenants 
restrictive covenants which specify  among other things  restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness and the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
these facilities also include certain negative pledges

the loan agreement also contains customary restrictions on  among other things  additional indebtedness liens on our assets  sales or transfers of assets  investments  restricted payments including payment of dividends and stock repurchases  issuance of equity securities  and mergers  acquisitions and other fundamental changes in our business 
the company s ownership in nn euroball aps has been pledged as collateral 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants as of decembe r we are in the process of renegotiating our existing credit facilities 
we expect to have the new facilities in place early during the second quarter of prior to entering into the new loan agreements  we expect to obtain short term working capital financing from our existing lender of approximately million 
to date  cash generated by euroball and its subsidiaries has been used exclusively for general euroball specific purposes including investments in property  plant and equipment and prepayment of the euroball senior secured ter m loan  which is secured by euroball and its subsidiaries 
accordingly  no dividends have been declared or paid that may have been used by the company to pay down our domestic credit facilities 
while the company controls the declaration of such dividends  we would only receive cash distributed in accordance with our ownership percentage in euroball 
the company s arrangements with its domestic customers typically provide that payments are due within days following the date of the company s shipment of goods  while arrangements with foreign customers other than foreig n customers that have entered into an inventory management program with the company generally provide that payments are due within or days followin g the date of shipment 
under the domestic ball and roller segments inventory management program with certain european customers  payments typically are due within days after the customer uses the product 
the company s sales and receivables can be influenced by seasonality due to the company s relative percentage of european business coupled with many foreign customers ceasing production during the month of august

nonetheless  as a result of these sales  the company s foreign exchange transaction and translation risk has increased 
various strategies to manage this risk are available to management including producing and selling in local currencies and hedging programs 
as of december   no currency hedges were in place 
in addition  a strengthening of the us dollar and or euro against foreign currencies could impair the ability of the company to compete with international competitors for foreign as well as domestic sales

the company intends to finance these activities with cash generated from operations and funds available under our credit facilities  whic h are in the process of renegotiation 
the company believes that funds generated from operations and borrowings from the renegotiated credit facilities will be sufficient to finance the company s working capital needs and projected capital expenditure requirements through december beginning in january skf may exercise its right under the shareholders agreement to cause the company to purchase its interest in eurobal l based on the put formula in the shareholders agreement 
the company anticipates that if such purchase becomes necessary  it may need to borrow additional funds because the purchase price is based on a formula using euroball s historical earnings and cash flow  the exact amount of the put cannot be determined until the put right is exercised 
skf has informed us that it intends to exercise it s right and we expect to purchase its interest during the second quarter of the table below sets forth certain of the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  certain payments due by period contractual obligations total less than years years after years year long term debt   operating leases    other long term obligations    total contractual cash    obligations other long term obligations consist principally of steel purchase commitments at the euroball segment see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

inflation and changes in prices while the company s operations have not been materially affected by inflation during recent years  prices for steel  engineered resins and other raw materials purchased by the company are subject to material change 
fo r example  during  due to an increase in worldwide demand for steel an d the decrease in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies  the company experienced an increase in the price of steel and some difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of steel from its existin g suppliers 
in the company s us operations our typical pricing arrangements with steel suppliers are subject to adjustment once every six months 
the company s euroball segment has entered into long term agreements with its primary steel supplier which provide for standard terms and conditions and annual pricing adjustments to offset material price fluctuations in steel 
the company typically reserves the right to increase product prices periodically in the event of increases in its raw material costs 
in the past  the company has been able to minimize the impact on its operations resulting from the steel price fluctuations by taking such measures 
certain sales agreements are in effect with skf and ina fag  which provide for minimum purchase quantities and specified  annual sales price adjustments that may be modified up or down for changes in material costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in th e normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments a s well as transacting in various foreign currencies 
to mitigate its exposure to these market risks  the company has established policies  procedures and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities 
domestically  these borrowings which include a millio n senior  non secured floating rate revolving credit facility which is used to maintain liquidity and fund its business operations domestically as well as a reducing revolving credit line facility 
in europe  euroball has a million euro floating rate credit facility  and a million euro floating rate secure d term loan 
at december   the company had million outstanding unde r the domestic revolving credit facility and euroball had million euro outstanding under the euroball credit facility 
a one percent increase in the interest rate charged on the company s outstanding borrowings under both credit facilities would result in interest expense increasing by approximately  during and  during in connection with a variable euribor rat e debt financing in july the company s majority owned subsidiary  nn eurobal l aps entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of euro million for the purpose of fixing the interest rate on a portion of their debt financing 
the interest rate swap provides for the company to receive variable euribor interest payments and pay fixed interest 
the interest rate swap agreement expires in july and the notional amount amortizes in relation to principal payments on the underlying debt over the life of the swap 
the nature and amount of the company s borrowings may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
translation of the company s operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies is impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates 
the compan y  mainly at its euroball segment  bills and receives payment from some of its foreign customers in their own currency 
to date  the company has not been materially adversely affected by currency fluctuations of foreign exchange restrictions 
however  to help reduce exposure to foreign currency fluctuation  management has incurred debt in euros and periodically used foreign currency hedges 
these currency hedging programs allow management to hedge currency exposures when these exposures meet certain discretionary levels 
the company did not hold a position in any foreign currency hedging instruments as of december
