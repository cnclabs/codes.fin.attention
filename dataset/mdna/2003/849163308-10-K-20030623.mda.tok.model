a focus on providing quality merchandise with outstanding customer service was the foundation of norbert s vision 
as a true pioneer in the industry norbert s mission was three simple things 
to see things through the eyes of the customer  to do a  little things better and to focus on being the best  not the biggest 
over the last years sport chalet has grown into a chain of specialty retail superstores serving both southern california and nevada 
the company s growth strategy had historically focused on southern california  but now contemplates opening new stores throughout california and nevada as suitable locations are found over the next several fiscal years 
over the past three years  the company has opened six new stores  two of which include the company s recent expansion into the las vegas market  and relocated one store 
the company currently plans to open at least three stores during the next months  of which two will be the company s initial expansion into northern california 
the first northern california location will be in the east bay city of antioch and the second will be in central sacramento 
the company s third location will be in the san bernardino county city of redlands 
future store openings are subject to availability of satisfactory store locations based on local competitive conditions  site availability and cost and the company s ability to provide and maintain high service levels and quality brand merchandising at competitive prices 
for fiscal  average sales per store for stores open throughout both fiscal and fiscal were million  with corresponding average sales per square foot of store openings are expected to have a favorable impact on sales volume  but will negatively affect profit in the short term 
new stores tend to have higher costs in the early years of operation  due primarily to increased promotional costs and lower sales on a per employee basis until the store matures 
as the store matures  sales tend to level off and expenses decline as a percentage of sales 
the company s stores generally require three years to attract a stable  mature customer base 
the company estimates the cost of opening an average new store to be approximately million consisting primarily of the investment in inventory net of average vendor payables  the cost of fixtures and equipment and pre opening expenses  such as the costs associated with training employees and stocking the store 
opening costs for each new store can vary significantly depending on how much the landlord has agreed to contribute to the company s required improvements 

table of contents the company s sales partially depend on the economic environment and level of consumer spending in california and nevada 
the retail industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variation  and a recession in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits have had  and may in the future have  a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s corporate offices in prior years were spread over seven nearby buildings in la canada  california neighboring the store where the company was founded

in coming years the company plans to retro fit certain mature stores to conform to the new prototype 
during fiscal  two stores will be remodeled  with expected grand re openings in early summer the company continually updates its prototype format to remain relevant and continually enhance the customer shopping experience 
while the company has taken advantage of unusual building layouts in the past and when appropriate may continue to do so in the future  it will utilize as many prototype design elements as possible

the market for retail sporting goods is seasonal in nature 
as with many other retailers  the company s business is heavily affected by sales of merchandise during the holiday season 
in addition  the company s product mix has historically emphasized cold weather sporting goods merchandise  particularly winter sports related products 
management anticipates that this seasonal trend in sales will persist 
to be less dependent upon winter business  management continues to emphasize a broadened product mix that offers merchandise generally purchased by consumers in the spring  summer and fall seasons 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results seasonality 
marketing and advertising the company generates all of its marketing campaigns in house  with production support from outside vendors as needed 
the campaigns are designed to reinforce the strategic direction of the company through its brand and product offerings  as well as communicate a focused and consistent theme event calendar for every store location utilizing newspaper  direct mail  radio  billboards  magazines and the internet 
through the team sales division the company reaches out to communities in which its stores do business contributing to local teams and leagues 
the company s advertising leverage has been boosted by vendor payments under cooperative advertising arrangements as well as vendor participation in sponsoring sporting events and programs 
purchasing and distribution in order to provide a full line of specialty and sporting goods brands and a wide selection the company purchases merchandise from over  vendors 
vendor payment terms typically range from to days from the company s receipt  and there are no long term purchase commitments 
the company s largest vendor  nike  inc  accounted for approximately and of the company s total inventory purchases for fiscal and  respectively 
in february  the company moved its distribution operations to a new  square foot facility located in ontario  california 
this facility replaced the company s  square foot warehouse and a  square foot satellite facility  and has been designed to support growth plans for the foreseeable future 
labor savings from operating efficiency provided by the new facility have offset increases in occupancy costs in the short term and installation of warehouse management software will further improve warehousing and logistical cost management 
the distribution center serves as the primary receiving  distribution and warehousing facility 
common carriers deliver merchandise to the nevada stores  while the company s own trucks deliver merchandise from the distribution center to the southern california stores 
a minimal amount of merchandise is shipped directly by vendors to the stores 
most of the product received at the distribution center is processed by unpacking and verifying the contents received and then sorting the contents by store for delivery 
some of the product received at the distribution center is pre packaged and pre ticketed by the vendor so it can be immediately cross docked to trucks bound for the stores 
due to the efficiencies cross docking creates  the company encourages its vendors to pre package and ticket their products 
some of the merchandise is held at the distribution center for future allocation to the stores based on current sales trends as directed by the replenishment system to optimize inventory levels 
the company believes that advantages to a single distribution center include reduced per store inventory levels  quicker inventory replenishment  consolidated vendor returns  and reduced transportation costs 

table of contents in november the company implemented a jda e inventory replenishment system 
the e system consists of three modules i advanced warehouse replenishment  which manages purchases from vendors  ii advanced store replenishment  which manages warehouse to store replenishment  and iii advanced optimization  which synchronizes the two systems 
currently  inventory management utilizes the e system to manage approximately of the company s inventory dollars 
the remaining of the inventory purchases are managed by traditional methods conducted by the buying staff on a short term purchase order basis 
information systems the company uses a best of breed approach to information systems 
all new systems communicate with a legacy system that has become the centralized data repository and the primary financial system 
consistent with the stated direction to upgrade the legacy systems  those applications were migrated to a new sun computer in may with this enhancement in place  the foundation has been established for future developments 
in october store systems were upgraded to the encore retail suite of applications from crs retail systems  an open technology allowing flexibility for the future 
a custom rental program was added to the store system in october merchandise replenishment is controlled by e software from the jda software group  inc running on an ibm as in fiscal the processing of debit credit card authorization was upgraded to allow on line debit and signature capture  and the distribution center was enhanced with warehouse management software from highjump 
future projects may include edi software from sps commerce  customer relationship software  the switch from gift certificates to gift cards  and continual on going enhancements to the legacy system  among other projects 
trademarks and trade names the company uses the sport chalet name as a service mark in connection with its business operations 
the company has registered sport chalet as a service mark with the state of california  and has obtained federal registration for certain purposes  which has been successfully defended in the past against attack by third parties 
the company also retains common law rights to the name  which it has used since the lack of federal registration for certain purposes might pose a problem if the company were to expand into a geographic area where the name or any confusingly similar name is used by someone with prior rights 
industry and competition the market for retail sporting goods is highly competitive  fragmented and segmented 
the company competes with a variety of other retailers  including the following full line sporting goods chains  such as the sports authority  galyans  dick s sporting goods and big  specialty stores  such as rei  footaction  turner s  foot locker and west marine  supplier owned stores  such as nike  the north face  adidas and new balance  mass merchandisers  club stores  discount stores and department stores  such as wal mart  costco  target  macy s and sears  and e tailers and catalog merchandisers 
many of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company  or better name recognition in regions into which the company seeks to expand 
the company s industry is dominated by sporting goods superstore retailers  ie  full line sporting goods chains with stores typically larger than  square feet  often in freestanding locations 
superstore chains generally provide a greater selection of higher quality merchandise than other retailers  while remaining price competitive 
specialty retailers often have the advantage of a lower cost structure and a smaller footprint that can be located in shopping centers and strip malls  offering more customer convenience 

table of contents historically  the company has distinguished itself from its competitors by providing a broader selection of higher end specialty items that require higher levels of customer service and sales associate expertise than other superstore retailers in the southern california and nevada areas 
the company believes that its broad selection of high quality name brands and numerous specialty items at competitive prices  showcased by its well trained sales associates  differentiates its self from discount and department stores  traditional and specialty sporting goods stores and other superstore operations 
management believes the company s format takes advantage of several significant trends and conditions in the sporting goods industry 
these trends include the size of the industry  fragmented competition  superstore dominance  limited assortments offered by many sporting goods retailers  consumer preference for one stop shopping  and the importance of delivering value through selection  quality  service and price

none of the employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement

critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing the financial statements  the company is required to make estimates and judgments which affect the results of its operations and the reported value of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes that the following summarizes critical accounting policies which require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its financial statements 
inventory valuation 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out determined by the retail method of accounting or market 
the company considers cost to include direct cost of merchandise  plus internal costs associated with merchandise procurement  storage and handling 
the company regularly reviews aged and excess inventories to determine if the carrying value of such inventories exceeds market value 
a reserve is recorded to reduce the carrying value to market value as necessary 
a determination of market value requires estimates and judgment based on the company s historical markdown experience and anticipated markdowns based on future merchandising and advertising plans  seasonal considerations  expected business trends and other factors 

table of contents gift certificate redemption 
the company offers its customers the option of purchasing gift certificates which may be used toward the future purchase of the company s product offerings 
these gift certificates have no expiration dates 
the company records unredeemed gift certificates as a liability until the point of redemption 
the company s historical experience indicates that not all issued gift certificates are ultimately redeemed 
accordingly  the company periodically adjusts the carrying value of the gift certificate liability 
the company monitors redemption rates as a percent of issuances and uses this information to estimate probable redemption of all outstanding gift certificates 
this calculation is based on historical experience  and future redemption rates may vary if consumer purchasing practices change 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company accounts for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered impaired the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual store discounted cash flow to the asset carrying values 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the financial statements  income taxes are estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income is assessed  recognizing that future taxable income may give rise to new deferred tax assets 
to the extent that that future recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance would be established 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established or increased  an expense will be included within the tax provision in the income statement 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
based on the company s history of operating earnings  no valuation allowance has been recorded as of march  in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  a valuation allowance may need to be established  which could impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
provisions for income taxes for  and are based on numerous factors that are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which the company does business

factors that may affect future results the company s short and long term success is subject to many factors that are beyond the company s control 
stockholders and prospective stockholders in the company should consider carefully the following risk factors  in addition to other information contained in this report 
this annual report on form l k contains forward looking statements  which are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth below 
economic conditions 
the retail industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variations 
the merchandise sold by the company is generally a discretionary expense for its customers 
a recession in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits has had  and may do so in the future have  a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
competition 
the sporting goods business and the retail environment are highly competitive  and the company competes with national  regional and local full line sporting goods chains  specialty stores  supplier owned stores  discount and department stores  and e tailers 
a number of the company s competitors are larger and have greater resources than the company 
regional market concentration 
currently  all of the company s stores are located in southern california and the las vegas area of nevada 
accordingly  the company is subject to regional risks  such as the economy  weather conditions  natural disasters and government regulations 
for example  warm winter weather in the resorts frequented by southern california residents has affected sales in the past 
if the region were to suffer an economic downturn or if other adverse events were to occur  there could be an adverse effect on the company s net sales and profitability and its ability to implement its planned growth 
several of the company s competitors operate stores across the united states and  thus  are not as vulnerable as the company to such regional risks 
reliance on a single distribution center 
the company currently relies on a single distribution center in ontario  california 
any natural disaster or other serious disruption to this distribution center due to fire  earthquake or any other cause could damage a significant portion of the company s inventory and could materially impair both the company s ability to adequately stock its stores and the company s net sales and profitability 

table of contents expansion plan 
the company s continued growth depends on a strategy of opening new  profitable stores in existing markets and in new regional markets 
the ability to successfully implement this growth strategy could be negatively affected by any of the following suitable sites may not be available for leasing  the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease terms  the company might not be able to hire and retain qualified store personnel  and the company might not have the financial resources necessary to fund the company s expansion plans 
in addition  the company s expansion in new and existing markets may present competitive  distribution and merchandising challenges that differ from the current challenges 
these potential new challenges include competition among the company s stores  added strain on the company s distribution center  additional information to be processed by the company s management information systems and diversion of management attention from ongoing operations 
the company faces additional challenges in entering new markets  including consumers lack of awareness of the company  difficulties in hiring personnel and problems due to the company s unfamiliarity with local real estate markets and demographics 
new markets may also have different competitive conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than the company s existing markets 
to the extent that the company is not able to meet these new challenges  net sales could decrease and operating costs could increase 
furthermore  a decline in the company s overall financial performance  increased rents or any other adverse effects arising from the commercial real estate market in the company s markets may adversely affect the company s current growth plan 
there can be no assurance that the company will possess sufficient funds to finance the expenditures related to its planned growth  that new stores can be opened on a timely basis  that such new stores can be operated on a profitable basis  or that such growth will be manageable 
future capital requirements 
the company may not be able to fund its future growth or react to competitive pressures if it lacks sufficient funds 
unexpected conditions could cause the company to be in violation of its lender s operating covenants 
currently  the company feels it has sufficient cash available through its bank credit facilities and cash from operations to fund existing operations for the foreseeable future 
the company cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in the future if necessary 
management of growth 
since its inception  the company has experienced periods of rapid growth 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in maintaining or increasing its sales in the future 
any future growth in sales will require additional working capital and may place a significant strain on the company s management  management information systems  inventory management  distribution facilities and receivables management 
any failure to timely enhance the company s operating systems  or unexpected difficulties in implementing such enhancements  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company depends on the continued service of its senior management 
the loss of the services of any key employee could hurt the business 
also  the future success of the company depends on its ability to identify  attract  hire  train and motivate other highly skilled personnel 
failure to do so may adversely affect future results 

table of contents seasonality 
the company s sales volume increases significantly during the holiday season as is typical with other sporting goods retailers 
in addition  the company s product mix has historically emphasized cold weather sporting goods increasing the seasonality of the company s business 
in recent years the months of november  december and january represent between and  of the company s total net sales in recent years  while winter related products ranged from to of total net sales 
the operating results historically have been influenced by the amount and timing of snowfall at the resorts frequented by those living in southern california 
an early snowfall often has influenced sales because it generally extends the demand for winter apparel and equipment  while a late snowfall may have the opposite effect 
suppliers in the ski and snowboard industry require the company to make commitments for purchases of apparel and equipment by april for fall delivery  and only limited quantities of merchandise can be reordered during the fall 
consequently  the company places its orders in the spring anticipating snowfall in the winter 
if the snowfall does not at least provide an adequate base or occurs late in the season  or if sales do not meet projections  the company may be required to mark down its winter apparel and equipment 
variability of quarterly results 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  a substantial variation in its net sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company believes that the factors which influence this variability of quarterly results include general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending  changing consumer demands  the timing of the company s introduction of new products  the level of consumer acceptance of each new product  the seasonality of the markets in which the company participates  the weather and actions of competitors 
accordingly  a comparison of the company s results of operations from period to period is not necessarily meaningful  and the company s results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
closely controlled stock 
at june   norbert olberz  the company s founder  chairman emeritus  director and principal stockholder  owned approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
mr 
olberz effectively has the ability to control the outcome on all matters requiring stockholder approval  including  but not limited to  the election and removal of directors  and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets  and to control the company s management and affairs 
information systems are vulnerable 
the company s success  in particular the company s ability to successfully manage inventory levels and its centralized distribution system  largely depends upon the efficient operation of the company s computer hardware and software systems 
the company uses management information systems to track inventory information at the store level  replenish inventory from the company s warehouse  and aggregate daily sales information among other things 
these systems and the company s operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters  power loss  computer systems failures  internet and telecommunications or data network failure  operator negligence  improper operation by or supervision of employees  physical and electronic loss of data and similar events  and computer viruses  penetration by hackers seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information and other breaches of security 
the company seeks to minimize these risks by the use of backup facilities and redundant systems 
nevertheless any failure that causes an interruption in the company s operations or a decrease in inventory tracking could result in reduced net sales 

table of contents the company s business depends on anticipating consumer tastes 
if the company fails to anticipate changes in consumer preferences  it may experience lower net sales  higher inventory markdowns and lower margins 
products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty 
these preferences are also subject to change 
sporting goods are often subject to short lived trends  such as the short lived popularity of in line scooters 
outdoor wear is significantly influenced by fashion 
the company s success depends upon the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to trends in sporting goods merchandise and consumers participation in sports 
failure to identify and respond to these changes may cause net sales to decline 
in addition  because the company generally makes commitments to purchase products from vendors up to six months in advance of the proposed delivery  misjudging the market may over stock unpopular products and force inventory markdowns that could have a negative impact on profitability  or have insufficient inventory of a popular item that can be sold at full markup 
stock price 
the company s common stock is thinly traded making it difficult to sell large amounts 
the market price of the company s common stock is likely to be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as quarterly variations in operating results  operating results which vary from the expectations of securities analyst and investors  changes in financial estimates  changes in market valuations of competitors  announcements by the company or its competitors of a material nature  additions or departures of key personnel  future sales of common stock and stock volume fluctuations 
also  general political and economic conditions such as a recession or interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk consists primarily of borrowings under its credit facility  which bears interest at floating rates primarily libor rates 
the impact on earnings or cash flows during the next fiscal year from a change of basis points in the interest rate would not be significant
