these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties  and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below under risk factors as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this report 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of medical products designed to safely and effectively assist or replace the pumping function of the failing heart 
in july  in collaboration with leading medical centers  we commenced initial clinical trials for the world s first implantable  battery powered replacement heart  the abiocor 
the abiocor  which is intended for end stage heart failure patients  is designed to replace the failing ventricles of a patient s diseased heart and take over their pumping function 
the commencement of this initial clinical trial  approved by the fda under an ide  follows nearly three decades of research  development and testing related to this technology 
we currently manufacture and sell the bvs  a temporary heart assist device which was the first device approved by the fda as a bridge to recovery device for temporary treatment of all patients with failing but potentially recoverable hearts 
in may  we introduced the ab circulatory support system  a new console that will drive and control one or two bvs blood pumps  and that will serve as a platform for blood pump product line enhancements currently under development to meet patient needs across a broader spectrum of temporary heart assist applications 
we are working to develop other products to assist or replace the heart  including development of the abiocor ii 
our operating results reflect the dual activities of commercial operations and investments in the research and development of new technologies 
the bvs is a temporary heart assist device designed to assume the full pumping function of a patient s failing heart while allowing the heart to rest  heal and recover its function 
the bvs consists of single use external blood pumps and cannulae and a reusable pneumatic drive and control console 
all of our product revenues are currently derived from the bvs product line 
bvs revenues consist of sales to new customers and reorders from existing customers 
following commercial introduction of the bvs in the us  our focus was on obtaining market share beginning with the largest medical centers 
as of march   more than medical centers in the us had purchased the bvs  including of all major medical centers that perform more than heart surgeries annually 
while we continue to seek additional new customers for the bvs  our primary focus is to increase usage and product reorders by existing customers 
product reorders currently represent approximately of bvs product revenues 
during fiscal  no single customer represented more than of product revenues 
research and development is a significant portion of our operations 
our research and development efforts are focused on the development of new products  primarily related to heart assist and heart replacement  and the continued enhancement of the bvs and related technologies 
in fiscal  we incurred million in total research and development spending directed at the abiocor  at bvs improvements and product line extensions  at the abiocor ii and development of other potential products 
critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuations  intellectual property and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
sab establishes the sec s view that it is not appropriate to recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
further  sab requires that both title and the risks and rewards of ownership be transferred to the buyer before revenue can be recognized 
we believe that our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with sab we derive our revenues from two principal sources product sales  including maintenance service agreements  and funded research and development contracts and grants from government and other third party sources 
the majority of our product revenues are derived from our shipment of bvs products to fulfill customer orders for a specified number of consoles and blood pumps for a specified price 
we recognize revenues and record costs related to such sales upon product shipment 
product revenues are also derived from extended term contracts with certain of our customers  which contracts provide the customers with units of our bvs product under extended term contracts 
these contracts  which typically have terms of one to three years  provide for the company to receive a fixed  non refundable amount of money over a set period of time in return for our providing these customers with bvs consoles and blood pumps at the start of the contract and restocking the customer with bvs blood pumps during the term of the contract 
the exact quantity of such additional pumps to be supplied  if any  is limited to the actual usage of the product by the customer to support their patients 
under these contracts  we recognize revenue  and record related cost of product revenues  ratably over the term of the contract using an estimated per unit selling price based upon actual shipments of pumps to customers compared to the maximum number of additional pumps allowable under the contract  or when a maximum number is not specified  compared to our estimate of additional pumps that might be required by the customer 
in the majority of contracts that contain contractual limits on the number of pumps  customers do not use the maximum number of allowable pumps and  as a result  we recognize the remaining deferred revenue at the end of the contract term with no associated incremental cost at that time 
when we do not have a contractual maximum number of pumps upon which to rely  we estimate customer blood pump usage and resulting per unit selling price based upon historical experience and based on information from our customers 
we update these estimates over the term of a contract based upon significant and quantifiable changes in customer information 
cash received in advance of revenue in connection with the sale of blood pumps under extended term contracts is recorded as deferred revenue and is classified as a current or long term liability depending on the expected shipment dates of the blood pumps 
maintenance service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the service contracts based upon the elapsed term of the service contract 
government sponsored research and development contracts and grants generally provide for payment on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
revenues from these contracts and grants are recognized as work is performed  provided the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
under contracts in which the company elects to spend significantly more on the development project during the term of the contract than the total contract amount  the company prospectively recognizes revenue on such contracts ratably over the term of the contract as it incurs related research and development costs  provided the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
inventories 
we value our inventory of products held for sale at the lower of cost or current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  adversely impacting our financial results for the period in which the additional excess or obsolete inventory is identified 
all of our inventories are related to our bvs product line 
we do not currently capitalize any costs related to abiocor inventory since the product is part of a clinical trial and is not available for sale 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  as of march   the company had federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million which begin to expire in the company also has research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million which begin to expire in we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as an offset against these otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit 
in the event that we determine in the future that the company will be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax benefit  an adjustment to deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such a determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues year ended march  revenues products funded research and development total revenues costs and expenses cost of product revenues research and development selling  general and administrative total costs and expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net net loss fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal product revenues 
during fiscal  we derived our revenues primarily from our bvs product line 
our domestic revenues accounted for of total product revenues during fiscal and of product revenues for fiscal our bvs product offering is a mature product line that consists primarily of a computer controlled drive and control console and single use blood pumps 
we have penetrated over of medical centers that perform more than open heart procedures per year with our consoles 
our primary revenue growth potential has been in domestic reorders of bvs blood pumps 
during the fiscal year ended march   both our domestic bvs blood pump reorder unit shipments and revenue increased by in comparison to the prior year 
despite our reorder business growth  we experienced a million  or decline in overall product revenues due to a decline in revenues recognized from bvs blood pumps shipped under extended term contracts and revenues from shipments of bvs consoles 
our new product  the ab console  which received fda market approval in may  is expected to increase console revenues from both new and existing customers 
funded research and development revenues 
we have de emphasized efforts to obtain research government contracts and grants as a result of redirecting our technical personnel and other resources towards development and commercialization of existing technology 
as a result  funded research and development revenues have declined to a negligible level during the fiscal year ended march  during the prior fiscal year we recognized the final million remaining under our abiocor nhlbi contract and million related to abiocor clinical trial preparations for certain us and european medical centers 
as of march   our total backlog of research and development contracts and grants was million 
all of these contracts and grants contain provisions that make them terminable at the convenience of the government 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was consistent at for fiscal and fiscal research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal research and development expenses were of total revenues for fiscal and of total revenues in the prior year 
the majority of the decrease in fiscal costs are associated with reductions in materials and labor costs associated with pilot manufacturing for the abiocor clinical trial 
research and development expense for fiscal also included costs associated with continued improvements to the bvs product line  including efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for our new ab console and new single use blood pump which is intended to improve upon the ease of use  quality of life  and mobility offered for post cardiotomy and other short term bridge to recovery patients provided by the current bvs blood pump 
research and development expense also included costs associated with future heart assist blood pumps and cannulae that are expected to operate with the new ab platform 
also included in research and development expense during fiscal are costs associated with continued development and testing of the abiocor ii 
we anticipate that the majority of our near term focus will be on further extending the bvs product line  successfully continuing the initial abiocor clinical trial  and developing the abiocor ii 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  from million in the prior year to million in fiscal year ended march  this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced labor and benefit costs  public relations and travel costs 
partially offsetting these expense reductions was the additional fees and other expenses we incurred related to the replacement of arthur andersen as our auditors 
interest and other income 
other income consists primarily of interest earned on our investment balances  net of expenses and foreign exchange gain or loss 
interest and other income decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to reduced yields on investments resulting from lower average interest rates and lower average fund balances available for investment 
this decline in investment income was slightly offset by foreign translation gains as a result of the stronger euro against the us dollar 
net loss 
net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million  or per share 
this compares to a net loss of approximately million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the losses for both years are primarily attributable to development and clinical testing costs associated with the abiocor  the abiocor ii  the ab console and costs of developing other technologies and products 
fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal product revenues 
product revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in product revenues was attributable to increased sales of bvs disposable blood pumps to existing and new customers  including to international customers  and increased sales of our bvs t transport backup console 
these increases reflect increases in product shipments  including the timing of previously deferred revenue under extended term contracts 
the portion of product revenues derived from sales of disposable blood pumps and related accessories and services increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the portion of product revenues derived from sales of bvs consoles increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal domestic product revenues included approximately million from extended term contracts in fiscal and million in fiscal domestic sales accounted for of total product revenue during the fiscal and of product revenue for fiscal funded research and development revenues 
contract revenues decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal approximately million of the contract revenues recognized in fiscal were derived from our abiocor government contract compared to million in the prior year as our funding under that contract ended in fiscal as is typical for research and development programs that have matured to the stage where they are ready to commence human clinical trials  we do not anticipate additional government research and development funding for abiocor 
included in funded research and development for the year just ended was million in revenues recorded in connection with providing specialized training to medical centers involved with our us and european abiocor clinical trials 
as of march   our total backlog of research and development contracts and grants was million 
all of these contracts and grants contain provisions that make them terminable at the convenience of the government 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues decreased to for fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease is primarily due to the expiration of an agreement on august   in which we paid royalties to third parties on certain bvs product revenues and to the proportionate increase in sales of bvs disposable blood pumps relative to sales of lower margin bvs consoles 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in the prior fiscal year 
research and development expenses were of total revenues for the fiscal and of total revenues in the prior year 
included in research and development expenses for fiscal were million in cost incurred with our acquisition of rights to the penn state heart 
excluding these acquisition costs  research and development expenses increased by million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal research and development expenses incurred for the abiocor increased by million to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase in abiocor expenditures during the fiscal year just ended is primarily attributable to our clinical trial that began in july and includes costs associated with increased manufacturing  testing and documentation activities 
research and development expense for the fiscal year ended march  also included million in expenditures related to the development of the abiocor ii and million in expenditures for other products under development and for enhancements for the bvs product line 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal year ended march  from million in the prior year 
expenditures increased to of total revenues from of total revenues in the same period a year earlier as a result of increased staffing  including creating of a direct sales and clinical support team in europe  and public relations activities associated with the commencement of the abiocor clinical trial 
interest and other income 
interest and other income consists primarily of interest earned on our investment balances  net of interest and other expenses 
interest and other income decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to reduced yields on investments resulting from lower average interest rates and to lower average fund balances available for investment 
net loss 
net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million  or per share 
this compares to a net loss of approximately million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the losses for both years are primarily attributable to development and clinical testing costs associated with the abiocor and costs of acquiring and developing other technologies and products 
liquidity and capital resources we have supported our operations primarily with net revenues from sales of our bvs product line  government contracts and proceeds from our equity financings 
as of march   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million 
during our fiscal year ended march   we conducted an extensive realignment of our operations designed to improve productivity and align human and other resources with the needs of the company as it moves towards the commercial introduction of the ab  including new generations of heart assist blood pumps designed for various patient applications  and the commercial introduction of the abiocor during subject to approval of an hde by the fda 
as a result of this realignment effort  we have reduced our cash consumption  as determined by the combined net change in our cash and short term marketable securities  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  or a decrease of million 
our goal  based on our focus on commercial growth  our improved systems and processes designed and implemented during the past year to impose efficiency  our expected commercial introduction of the ab and  if and when approved by the fda  commercial introduction of new single use blood pumps  is to continue to reduce our cash consumption during fiscal we believe that our revenue from product sales together with existing resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations  including the planned expenditures for our internally funded abiocor  abiocor ii and new bvs and ab development and product extension efforts  for the next twelve months 
however  we may require significant additional funds in order to complete the development  conduct clinical trials  and achieve regulatory approvals of the abiocor  abiocor ii and other products under development over the next several years 
we may also need additional funds for possible future strategic acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies complementary to our business 
if additional funds are required  we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of equity or from borrowings 
during fiscal  operating activities used million of cash 
net cash used by operating activities in fiscal reflected a net loss of million  including non cash depreciation and amortization and bad debt expense of million 
cash was also used to reduce accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenues by million  million and million  respectively 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  investing activities provided million of cash 
approximately million in cash was provided from maturities of short term marketable securities net of the acquisition of short term marketable securities 
we also expended cash for patent additions and capital equipment and leasehold improvements of million and million  respectively 
financing activities generated million of cash during fiscal primarily as a result of stock options exercised during the fiscal year and the purchase of shares by employees under the employee stock purchase plan 
income taxes incurred during fiscal were not material  and we continue to have significant net tax operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the following table in thousands summarizes our contractual obligations at march  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations     we have the option of terminating the lease for our primary operating facility in the lump sum buyout cost for early termination is million 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation expands the disclosure requirements of guarantee obligations and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation assumed under a guarantee 
in general  fin no 
applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset  liability  or equity security of the guaranteed party 
we apply the disclosure provisions of fin to agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses 
these disclosure provisions expand those required by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  by requiring that guarantors disclose certain types of guarantees  even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor s performance is remote 
in addition  the impact of new arrangements entered into since january  is not significant 
the following is a description of arrangements in which we are a guarantor 
agreements in the ordinary course of its business we enter into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business  typically with underwriters  contractors  clinical sites and customers  that include indemnification provisions 
under these provisions we generally indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of our activities 
these indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of march  patent indemnifications in many sales transactions  we indemnify customers against possible claims of patent infringement caused by our products 
the indemnifications contained within sales contracts usually do not include limits on the claims 
we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle patent infringement claims related to sales transactions 
as a result  the estimated fair value of the potential liability is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for patent infringement as of march  indemnification of officers and directors our corporate by laws permit us  except to the extent expressly prohibited by law  to indemnify our officers  directors  employees and agents against judgments  fines  penalties and amounts paid in settlement  including legal fees and all appeals  incurred in connection with civil or criminal action or proceedings  as it relates to their services to abiomed and its subsidiaries in any capacity 
the indemnification does not apply if the person is adjudicated not to have acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that his or her actions were in our best interests 
we have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors 
the indemnification agreements are intended to require us to provide the maximum indemnification permitted by law 
our by laws and the indemnification agreements provide no limit on the amount of the indemnification  however  we have purchased directors and officers insurance coverage to cover claims made against directors and officers during the applicable policy periods 
as a result of the insurance policy coverage  the estimated fair value of these indemnification provisions is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of march  risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
current and prospective investors should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties described in this section and all of the other information in this report 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be severely harmed by any of the following risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline if any of these risks and uncertainties develop into actual events 
our future success is strongly dependent on development of a new line of assist products and implantable replacement hearts 
our development efforts may not be successful 
we are currently devoting our major research and development and regulatory efforts  and significant financial resources  to the development of the ab  abiocor and abiocor ii 
the development of assist and replacement heart devices such as the ab  abiocor and abiocor ii  and other new products  presents enormous challenges in a variety of areas  many or all of which we may have difficulty in overcoming  including blood compatible surfaces  blood compatible flow  manufacturing techniques  pumping mechanisms  physiological control  energy transfer  anatomical fit and surgical techniques 
specifically  for many years  we and other parties have been attempting to develop a heart replacement device  but to date  none of these efforts has been proven successful 
we cannot be sure that we will be successful in our development efforts  and in the event that we are unable to commercialize the abiocor and abiocor ii  our business and financial condition would be adversely affected 
the markets for our products under development are unproven 
even if our products are successfully developed and approved by the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities  they may not enjoy commercial acceptance or success  which would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
several factors could limit our success  including our need to create a market for our new products  ab  abiocor  abiocor ii  and possible limited market acceptance among physicians  medical centers  patients and third party payers  the need for surgeons to develop or be trained in new surgical techniques to use our product effectively  limitations on the number of patients who may have access to physicians and medical centers with adequate training  equipment and personnel to make use of our products  limitations inherent in first generation devices  and the potential failure to develop successive improvements  including increases in service life  which would reduce the addressable market for our products  the lifestyle limitations that patients will have to accept  the timing and amount of reimbursement for these products  if any  by third party payers  the introduction by other companies of new treatments  products and technologies which compete with our products  and may reduce their market acceptance  or make them obsolete  the reluctance  due to ethical considerations  of physicians  patients and society as a whole to accept significant medical devices that replace or assist the heart  and the reluctance of physicians  patients and society as a whole to accept the finite life and risk of mechanical failure of devices that replace or assist the heart 
the commercial success of the ab  abiocor  abiocor ii and other heart assist products will require acceptance by cardiovascular surgeons and interventional and heart failure cardiologists  a limited number of whom significantly influence medical device selection and purchasing decisions 
we may achieve our business objectives only if our other products are accepted and recommended by leading physicians  which is likely to be based on a determination by these physicians that our products are safe  cost effective and represent acceptable methods of treatment 
although we have developed relationships with leading cardiac surgeons and cardiologists  we cannot assure that these existing relationships and arrangements can be maintained or that new relationships will be established in support of our products 
if cardiovascular surgeons and cardiologists do not consider our products to be adequate for the treatment of our target cardiac patient population or if a sufficient number of physicians recommend and use competing products  it would seriously harm our business 
testing of our new products will involve uncertainties and risks which could delay or prevent new product introductions  require us to incur substantial additional costs or result in our failure to bring our products to market 
development and testing of design changes to the ab  abiocor  abiocor ii and other products under development is often extensive  expensive and time consuming 
some of the tests for our products may require months or years to perform  and we could be required to begin these tests again if we modify one of our products to correct a problem identified in testing 
even modest changes to certain components of our products can take months or years to complete and test 
if results of pre clinical or clinical testing of our products under development indicate that design changes are required  such changes could cause serious delays that would adversely affect our results of operations 
a number of companies in the medical industry have suffered delays  cost overruns and project terminations despite achieving promising results in pre clinical testing or early clinical testing 
in the event that we suffer setbacks in the pre clinical or clinical testing of our heart assist and replacement products  these products may be delayed  require further funding  and possibly may not be brought to market 
if we fail to obtain approval from the fda and from foreign regulatory authorities  we cannot market and sell the ab  abiocor or other products in the us and in other countries 
if we cannot demonstrate through clinical testing on humans or other means that the ab  the abiocor or other new products under development and testing are safe and effective  we will not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in the us or other countries for the commercial sale of these products 
our clinical testing of the abiocor is in its early stages 
delays  budget overruns  and project terminations are not uncommon even after promising pre clinical and clinical trials of medical products 
we intend to conduct clinical testing for the abiocor and other heart assist and heart replacement products with critically ill patients  and these patients may die or suffer other adverse medical results for reasons which may or may not be related to the product being tested 
those outcomes could seriously delay the completion of clinical testing  as could the unavailability of suitable patients for clinical trials  both of which are outside our control 
we cannot assure that the rate of patient enrollment in our clinical trials will be consistent with our expectations or be sufficient to allow us to complete our clinical trials for the abiocor or our other products under development in a timely manner  if at all 
delays could defer the marketing and commercial sale of our products  require further funding  and possibly result in failure to bring the products to market 
we have announced our intention to seek and obtain initial approval from the fda to market the abiocor under a humanitarian device exemption hde rather than through a pma 
in order to be eligible for an hde  a device must first receive fda s certification that it addresses a patient population of less than  patients a year for which there is no other available therapy 
approval of an hde by the fda then requires that we demonstrate that the abiocor is safe  potentially effective and that its benefits outweigh its associated risks 
we cannot assure that the fda or any other regulatory authority will act quickly or favorably on our requests for this product approval  or that the fda or any other regulatory authority will not require us to provide additional data that we do not currently anticipate in order to obtain product approvals 
we cannot apply for fda approval to market the abiocor under an hde or any of our other products under development until the products successfully complete their clinical trials 
the factors referred to above could prevent successful completion or cause significant delays of these trials and subsequent hde approval 
moreover  if safety problems develop  the fda could stop our trials before completion 
if we are successful in obtaining fda approvals for the abiocor based on a phased approach that begins with an hde  the initial approvals are likely to include conditions or limitations to particular indications that would limit the available market for these products 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approvals for use of the abiocor or our other products under development  or if the patient populations for which they are approved are not sufficiently broad  the commercial success of these products could be limited 
we intend to market the abiocor and our other new products in international markets  including the european union and japan 
we must obtain separate regulatory approvals in order to market our products in other jurisdictions 
the approval process may differ among those jurisdictions and approval in the us or in any other jurisdiction does not ensure approval in other jurisdictions 
obtaining foreign approvals could result in significant delays  difficulties and costs for us  and require additional trials and additional expense 
if we obtain regulatory approval of our new products  the products will be subject to continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements  which could affect the manufacturing and marketing of our products 
the fda continues to review products even after they have received initial approval 
if and when the fda approves the ab  abiocor  or our other products under development  the manufacture and marketing of these products will be subject to continuing regulation  including compliance with current quality systems regulations and good manufacturing practices  known as qsr gmp  adverse event reporting requirements and prohibitions on promoting a product for unapproved uses 
we will also be required to obtain additional approvals in the event we significantly modify the design of an approved product or the product s labeling or manufacturing process 
modifications of this type are common with new products  and we anticipate that the first generation of each of our products will undergo a number of changes  refinements and improvements over time 
for example  the current configuration of the abiocor s thoracic unit  or replacement heart  is sized for patients with relatively large chest cavities  and we anticipate that we will need to obtain regulatory approval of thoracic units of other sizes 
if we are not able to obtain regulatory approval of modifications to our current and future products  the commercial success of these products would be limited 
we and our third party suppliers of product components are also subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda for qsr gmp and other requirements 
enforcement actions resulting from failure to comply with government requirements could result in fines  suspensions of approvals  recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  and affect the manufacture and marketing of our products 
the fda could withdraw a previously approved product from the market upon receipt of newly discovered information  including a failure to comply with regulatory requirements  the occurrence of unanticipated problems with products following approval  or other reasons  which could adversely affect our operating results 
the cost of developing and manufacturing the ab  abiocor  abiocor ii and other planned new products is substantial for a company of our size and will exert a strain on our available resources 
while our total research and development expenditures have begun to decrease  spending on our ab  abiocor  abiocor ii and other products under development will remain significant for some time 
we expect that we will also need to make significant expenditures to begin to manufacture and market the ab  abiocor and our other planned new products in commercial quantities for sale in the us and other countries  if and when we obtain regulatory approval to do so 
we cannot be sure that our estimates of capital expenditures for the development of our new products will be accurate 
we could have significant cost overruns  which could reduce our ability to commercialize our products 
any delay or inability to commercialize our products under development could adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations 
we do not operate at a profit and cannot be assured of future profitability 
we had a net loss of million in fiscal and a net loss of million in fiscal we are committed to making large expenditures for our new products under development in fiscal and subsequent fiscal years  which may result in losses in future periods 
these expenditures include costs associated with performing clinical trials  continuing our research and development relating to our new products under development  seeking regulatory approvals and  if we receive these approvals  commencing commercial manufacturing and marketing 
the amount of these expenditures is difficult to forecast accurately  and cost overruns may occur 
we plan to fund a portion of these expenditures from our limited existing financial resources and revenues from bvs sales  including sales of our new ab console and a new generation of blood pumps if and when approved by the fda  which are variable and uncertain 
we cannot be sure that we will have the necessary funds to develop and commercialize our new products  or that additional funds will be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event that we are unable to obtain the necessary funding to develop and commercialize our products  our business may be adversely affected 
our operating results may fluctuate unpredictably 
our annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated historically and we expect these fluctuations to continue 
among the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate are costs we incur developing and testing the ab  abiocor and other new products or product enhancements  the timing of regulatory actions  such as product approvals or recalls  costs we incur in anticipation of future sales  such as inventory purchases  expansion of manufacturing facilities  or establishment of international sales offices  the timing of customer orders and deliveries  particularly of ab consoles  bvs blood pumps and consoles to current and new customers and the timing of revenue deferred and recognized under extended term contracts  competitive changes  such as price changes or new product introductions that we or our competitors may make  and economic conditions in the health care industry and the state of cost containment efforts  including reimbursement policies 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical and future results will not necessarily be meaningful  and that investors should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
to the extent we experience the factors described above  our future operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors from time to time  which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the bvs product line  our principal product and current primary source of revenues  is vulnerable to competitive pressures  disruptions in sales  continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements 
all of our product revenues to date have come from sales of the bvs line of products 
we believe that we will continue to rely heavily on our bvs product line for at least the next several years  unless and until we are able to successfully develop or acquire  obtain regulatory approval for  and sell our ab console and new products 
in the event that a competitor were to introduce new treatments  products and technologies which compete with our products  add new features to their existing products or reduce their prices to make their products more financially attractive to customers  our revenue from our bvs products could decline 
for example  in the event of the expansion of technologies  which allow heart surgical procedures to be performed without stopping the heart  a reduction in the market for the bvs could potentially result 
further  the bvs is subject to stringent and continuing fda and other regulatory requirements  including compliance with qsr gmp  adverse event reporting  prohibitions on promoting the bvs for unapproved uses  and continued inspection and market surveillance by the fda 
if bvs products are recalled or otherwise withdrawn from the market  our revenues would likely decline  which would hurt our business 
in addition  variations in the quantity and timing of sales of bvs consoles have a disproportionate effect on our revenues  because the price of the console is substantially greater than the price of our disposable blood pumps 
if we cannot maintain and increase our revenues from our bvs product line  our overall business and financial condition could be adversely affected 
revenues from our bvs product line in fiscal decreased by from revenues in fiscal  and in fiscal our bvs revenues increased by from revenues in fiscal revenues derived from our extended term contracts were in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal to maintain or increase revenues from sales of our bvs products  we may be required to adopt new sales and marketing strategies  some of which may require expending additional capital resources  or execute on existing strategies 
the new strategies we may adopt or execute on include regularly introducing enhancements and product line extensions to the bvs  such as the new ab console  expanding sales of our bvs product line in international markets  some of which require separate regulatory approvals  seeking new categories of patients to support with our technology platform 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in carrying out these new strategies  our revenues may decline 
we may not be successful in expanding our sales activities into international markets 
we are seeking to expand our international sales of the bvs and ab console by recruiting direct sales and support teams for selected countries in europe 
to date we have limited experience in selling the bvs internationally 
in fiscal  approximately  and in fiscal  approximately  of our revenues from the bvs product line were derived from international sales 
our international operations will be subject to a number of risks  which may vary from the risks we experience in the us  including the need to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign countries before our products may be sold or used  longer sales cycles  dependence on local distributors  limited protection of intellectual property rights  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies  and political and economic instability 
if we are unable to effectively expand our sales activities in international markets  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we depend on third party reimbursement to our customers for market acceptance of our products 
if third party payers fail to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for purchase and use of our products  our profitability would be adversely affected 
sales of medical products largely depend on the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government health care programs and private health insurers 
the cost of our bvs system is substantial  and we anticipate that the cost of implanting the abiocor in a patient will also be substantial 
without the financial support of the government or third party insurers  the market for our products will be limited 
medical products and devices incorporating new technologies are closely examined by governments and private insurers to determine whether the products and devices will be covered by reimbursement  and if so  the level of reimbursement which may apply 
we cannot be sure that third party payors will reimburse sales of our products now under development  or enable us to sell them at profitable prices 
we also cannot be sure that third party payors will continue the current level of reimbursement to physicians and medical centers for use of the bvs 
any reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our business 
the federal government and private insurers have considered ways to change  and have changed  the manner in which health care services are provided and paid for in the us in the future  it is possible that the government may institute price controls and further limits on medicare and medicaid spending 
these controls and limits could affect the payments we collect from sales of our products 
internationally  medical reimbursement systems vary significantly  with some medical centers having fixed budgets  regardless of levels of patient treatment  and other countries requiring application for  and approval of  government or third party reimbursement 
even if we succeed in bringing our new products to market  uncertainties regarding future health care policy  legislation and regulation  as well as private market practices  could affect our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities at profitable prices 
prior to approving coverage for new medical devices  most third party payors require evidence that the product has received fda approval  is not experimental  and is medically necessary for the specific patient 
increasingly  third party payors require evidence that the devices being used are cost effective 
the abiocor and our other products under development may not meet these or future criteria  which could hurt our ability to market and sell these products 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our products require or if we are unable to develop additional manufacturing capacity  we will not be successful 
our products require precise  high quality manufacturing 
our failure to achieve and maintain these high manufacturing standards  including the incidence of manufacturing errors  design defects or component failures  could result in patient injury or death  product recalls or withdrawals  delays or failures in product testing or delivery  cost overruns or other problems that could seriously hurt our business 
we have from time to time voluntarily recalled certain products 
despite our very high manufacturing standards  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of errors  defects or failures 
if we are not able to manufacture the bvs in accordance with necessary quality standards  our business and results of operations may be negatively affected 
the abiocor involves even greater manufacturing complexities than the bvs 
the abiocor must be significantly more durable and meet different standards  which may be more difficult to achieve  than those that apply to our current bvs product line 
if we are unable to manufacture the abiocor or other future products on a timely basis at acceptable quality and cost and in commercial quantities  or if we experience unanticipated technological problems or delays in production  our business will suffer 
the manufacture of our products is and will continue to be complex and costly  requiring a number of separate processes and components 
achieving precision and quality control requires skill and diligence by our personnel 
further  to be successful  we believe we will need to increase our manufacturing capacity 
we may experience difficulties in scaling up manufacturing of our new products  including problems related to product yields  quality control and assurance  component and service availability  adequacy of control policies and procedures  and lack of skilled personnel 
if we cannot hire  train and retain enough experienced and capable scientific and technical workers  we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our current or future products at an acceptable cost and on time  which could limit market acceptance of our products or otherwise damage our business 
if our suppliers cannot provide the components we require  our ability to manufacture our products could be harmed 
we rely on third party suppliers to provide us with certain components used in the ab  abiocor  abiocor ii  bvs and our other products under development 
relying on third party suppliers makes us vulnerable to component part failures and to interruptions in supply  either of which could impair our ability to conduct clinical tests or to ship our products to our customers on a timely basis 
using third party vendors makes it difficult and sometimes impossible for us to test fully certain components  such as components on circuit boards  maintain quality control  manage inventory and production schedules and control production costs 
vendor lead times to supply us with ordered components vary significantly and can exceed six months or more 
both now and as we expand our manufacturing capacity  we cannot be sure that our suppliers will furnish us with required components when we need them 
these factors could make it more difficult for us to effectively and efficiently manufacture our products  and could adversely impact our results of operations 
some suppliers may be the only source for a particular component  which makes us vulnerable to cost increases and supply interruptions 
vendors may decide to limit or eliminate sales of certain products to the medical industry due to product liability or other concerns  and we might not be able to find a suitable replacement for those products 
manufacturers of our product components may be required to comply with the fda or other regulatory manufacturing regulations and to satisfy regulatory inspections in connection with the manufacture of the components 
if we cannot obtain a necessary component  we may need to find  test and obtain regulatory approval for a replacement component  produce the component ourselves or redesign the related product  which would cause significant delay and could increase our manufacturing costs 
any of these events could adversely impact our results of operations 
intense competition could harm our financial performance 
intense competition  rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards in the heart assist markets could decrease demand for our products or make them obsolete 
some of the companies  universities and research organizations developing competing products have greater resources and experience than we have 
our competitors could commence and complete clinical testing of their products  obtain regulatory approvals and begin commercial scale manufacturing of their products faster than we are able to for our products 
they could develop superior products or products of similar quality at the same or lower prices 
in addition  our customers often have limited budgets 
consequently  our products compete against a broad range of medical devices and therapies for these limited funds 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete effectively and successfully in the markets in which we participate 
we own patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights and other intellectual property and know how that we believe gives us a competitive advantage 
if we cannot protect our intellectual property  competition could force us to lower our prices  which could hurt our profitability 
our intellectual property rights are and will continue to be a critical component of our success 
a substantial portion of our intellectual property rights relating to the ab  abiocor  bvs  abiocor ii and other products under development is in the form of trade secrets  rather than patents 
in order to preserve certain proprietary information as trade secrets  we are required to restrict disclosure of information intended to constitute trade secrets to third parties 
we protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
certain of our consultants and third parties with whom we have business relationships may also provide services to other parties in the medical device industry  including companies  universities and research organizations that are developing competing products 
in addition  some of our former employees may seek employment with  and become employed by  our competitors 
we cannot assure that confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach  or that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors 
in addition  under our agreement for the purchase of the penn state heart technology  if we do not use reasonable efforts to further develop the penn state heart  certain rights to that technology could revert back to the pennsylvania state university and be used to compete against us 
the loss of trade secret protection for technologies or know how relating to the ab  abiocor  bvs or abiocor ii could adversely affect our business prospects 
our business position will also depend in part on our ability to defend our existing and future patents and rights and conduct our business activities free of infringement claims by third parties 
we intend to seek additional patents  but our pending and future patent applications may not be approved  may not give us a competitive advantage  and could be challenged by others 
patent proceedings in the us and in other countries may be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  patents issued by foreign countries may afford less protection than is available under us patent law  and may not adequately protect our proprietary information 
our competitors may independently develop proprietary technologies and processes that are the same as or substantially equivalent to ours  or design around our patents 
companies in the medical device industry typically obtain patents and frequently engage in substantial intellectual property litigation 
our products and technologies could infringe on the rights of others 
if a third party successfully asserts a claim for infringement against us  we may be liable for substantial damages  be unable to sell products using that technology  or have to seek a license or redesign the related product 
these alternatives may be uneconomical or impossible 
patent litigation could be costly  result in product development delays and divert the efforts and attention of management from our business 
if we cannot attract and retain the management  sales and other personnel we need  we will not be successful 
we depend heavily on the contributions of the principal members of our business  financial  technical  sales and support  regulatory and clinical  operating and administrative management and staff  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
competition for skilled and experienced business management  scientific personnel and sales personnel in the medical devices industry is intense 
if we lose the services of any of the principal members of our management and staff  or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future  especially scientific and sales personnel  our business could be adversely affected 
we expect to grow rapidly if our products under development advance through the approval process 
the expansion of personnel and facilities will strain our management and our financial and other resources 
if we cannot manage this growth successfully  our business will likely suffer 
product liability claims could damage our reputation and hurt our financial results 
the clinical use of medical products  even after regulatory approval  poses an inherent risk of product liability claims 
we maintain limited product liability insurance coverage  subject to deductibles and exclusions 
we cannot be sure that product liability insurance will be available in the future or will be available on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs  or that such insurance will provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
claims against us  regardless of their merit or potential outcome  may also hurt our ability to obtain physician endorsement of our products or expand our business 
many patients supported by our products do not survive 
there are many factors beyond our control that could result in patient death  including the condition of the patient prior to use of the product  the skill and reliability of physicians and hospital personnel using and monitoring the product  and product maintenance by customers 
however  the failure of the life support products we distribute for clinical test or sale could give rise to product liability claims and negative publicity 
the risk of product liability claims could increase as we introduce new products that are intended to support a patient until the end of life 
for example  the abiocor will have a finite life and could cause unintended complications to other organs and may not be able to successfully support all patients 
its malfunction could give rise to product liability claims whether or not it has extended or improved the quality of the patient s life 
we cannot be sure that we can obtain liability insurance to cover the ab  bvs  abiocor or other new products at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if we have to pay product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage  our financial condition will be adversely affected 
our rights distribution  certificate of incorporation and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and may prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium on our stock 
our rights distribution and provisions of our certificate of incorporation and of the delaware general corporation law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would allow our stockholders to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our stock 
our rights distribution and those provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value 
however  such provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control  which could negatively affect our stock price 
the market value of our common stock could vary significantly  based on market perceptions of the status of our development efforts 
the perception of securities analysts regarding our product development efforts could significantly affect our stock price 
as a result  the market price of our common stock has and could in the future change substantially when we or our competitors make product announcements 
many factors affecting our stock price are industry related and beyond our control 
if we make acquisitions  we could encounter difficulties that harm our business 
we may acquire companies  products or technologies that we believe to be complementary to our business 
if we do so  we may have difficulty integrating the acquired personnel  operations  products or technologies 
these difficulties may disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses  which could hurt our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
however  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of federal agency obligations  state and municipal bonds  and us treasury notes with maturities of one year or less 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at march  the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we believe that we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio
