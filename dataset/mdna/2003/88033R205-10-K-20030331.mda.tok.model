no cash dividends have been declared or paid by the company for the periods presented 
the company realized oil and gas revenues of  in as compared to  in and  in the decrease in revenues in from was due to a decrease in volumes produced in from the volumes produced in gas produced from the swan creek field was  mcf in as compared to  mcf in  resulting in approximately  in reduced revenues 
oil production from the swan creek field was  barrels in  down from  barrels in  resulting in approximately  in reduced revenues 
gas production from the kansas properties was  mcf in compared to  mcf in  resulting in approximately  in reduced revenues 
oil production from the kansas properties was  barrels in compared to  barrels in  resulting in approximately  in reduced revenues 
the reason for the decrease in volumes produced in was the company s dispute with bank one which significantly limited the company s ability to drill new wells and to work over under producing wells in kansas 
the increased revenues in of  compared to  in was primarily due to gas sales from the swan creek field of  being made for the first time during however  oil sales decreased by approximately  in from levels due to price decreases  as the number of barrels produced remained constant 
the company s subsidiary  tpc  had pipeline transportation revenues of  in  a decrease compared to of  in  the first year of transportation revenues 
the company s production costs and taxes have increased each year from to as additional costs have been incurred to maintain the kansas properties and to begin production from the swan creek field in and to maintain it in the production costs and taxes increased from  in to  in an increase in of  in production costs and taxes as compared to was due primarily to the commencement of production from the swan creek field 
depletion  depreciation  and amortization increased significantly in to  over and levels of  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the increase from over was due to depreciation being taken for the first time for a full year on the company s pipeline facilities in  whereas only a half year of depreciation was taken in after the pipeline was placed in service in mid year 
also  approximately  of loan fees were amortized in the primary increase in from was due to significant increases in depletion expense during  as a result of the following decreases in reserve estimates on oil and gas properties arising from declining commodity prices  certain of the company s gas wells had decreased production levels at year end due to problems encountered with liquids in the wells 
this decreased production level at year end was factored into the estimated future proved reserves calculation performed as of december   resulting in a lower future proved reserves estimate 
additionally  in the company took depreciation on the pipeline for the first time 
the company has significantly reduced its general administrative costs to  in from  in management has made a significant effort to control costs in every aspect of its operations 
some of these cost reductions include the closing of the new york office and a reduction in personnel from levels 
general and administrative expenses had increased to  in from  in the increases in from were attributable to an increase in insurance of approximately  in to expand coverage including blowout insurance and the addition of company provided medical insurance for employees 
interest expense for decreased significantly over levels due to the reduced interest rate on the bank one loan over the rate applicable under previous financing arrangements 
interest expense in was  compared to  in interest expense for had in turn increased significantly from  in this increase was due to additional interest cost associated with financing for the completion of phase ii of the company s mile pipeline 
the increase in was reduced by interest cost of approximately  which was capitalized in the first months of during construction of the pipeline 
interest of  was capitalized in public relations costs were significantly reduced in to  from  in as the company applied cost saving methods in the preparation of the annual report and in publishing of press releases

liquidity and capital resources on november   the company signed a credit facility agreement the credit agreement with the energy finance division of bank one  na in houston texas bank one whereby bank one extended to the company a revolving line of credit of up to million 
the initial borrowing base under the credit agreement was million 
on november   funds from the bank one credit line were used to satisfy existing indebtedness on the company s kansas properties  payoff the internal financing provided by directors and shareholders of the company for the completion of the company s mile intrastate pipeline  payoff a note due to spoonbill  inc for funds borrowed by the company for working capital  payoff a note due to malcolm e 
ratliff  the company s chief executive officer  for purchase by the company of a drilling rig and related equipment  and  payoff the remaining balance of a loan made to the company for working capital by edward wtgray iii  a former director of the company  due on december  
all of these obligations incurred interest at a rate substantially greater than the rate being charged by bank one under the credit agreement 
together with attorneys fees  mortgage taxes in tennessee and kansas and related fees the total drawn down on november  from the credit facility was  on or about april   the company received a notice from bank one stating that it had redetermined and reduced the borrowing base under the credit agreement to  and the bank required a million reduction of the outstanding loan 
the schedule of reserve reports required by the credit agreement upon which such redeterminations were to be based specifically established a procedure involving an automatic monthly principal payment of  commencing february  the company has remained current in payments of this monthly principal reduction through march  as of the date of this report  the outstanding principal balance under the credit agreement was 
as a result of bank one s unexpected reduction of the borrowing base and the corresponding demand for payment of million  combined with the fact that the company is still in the early stages of its oil and gas operating history during which time it has had a history of losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit of  and a working capital deficit of  as of december   the company s independent auditors indicated in their report on the audit of the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  that the company s ability to continue as a going concern is uncertain 
the company s ability to continue as a going concern depends upon its ability to obtain long term debt or raise capital and satisfy its cash flow requirements 
on may   the company filed suit against bank one in federal court in the eastern district of tennessee  northeastern division at greeneville  tennessee to restrain bank one from taking any steps pursuant to its credit agreement with the company to enforce its demand that the company reduce its loan obligation or else be deemed in default and for actual and punitive damages resulting from the wrongful demand in the amount of million 
on july   bank one filed its answer and counterclaim  alleging that its actions were proper under the terms of the credit agreement  and in the counterclaim  seeking to recover all amounts it alleges to be owed under the credit agreement  including principal  accrued interest  expenses and attorney s fees in the approximate amount of million 
on november   the company and bank one concluded a series of meetings and correspondence by reaching preliminary agreement upon the basic terms of a potential settlement 
any settlement is conditioned upon execution of final settlement documents  and the parties agreed to attempt to close the settlement by november  the principal element of the settlement proposal is for the bank and the company to enter into an amended and restated agreement for a new term loan to replace the prior revolving credit facility 
the proposed settlement agreement would place specific limits and requirement upon any ability of bank one to require a reduction of the loan balance 
such a reduction could only occur in the event the value of the oil and gas reserves of the company falls below an agreed upon figure in relation to the loan balance  pursuant to a formula which management is satisfied provides ample protection against any future reasonable likelihood of a similar problem arising in the manner causing initiation of the litigation between the company and bank one 
as of the date of this report  the company and bank one continue to negotiate the terms of a mutually satisfactory settlement agreement 
even if the company concludes a settlement with bank one  the company does not anticipate that it will be able to either increase its borrowing base under the bank one credit agreement or to borrow any additional sums from bank one 
to fund additional drilling and to provide additional working capital  the company would be required to pursue other options 
such options would include debt financing  sale of equity interests in the company  a joint venture arrangement  the sale of oil and gas interests  etc 
the inability of the company to obtain the necessary cash funding on a timely basis would have an unfavorable effect on the company s financial condition and would require the company to materially reduce the scope of its operating activities 
the harmful effects upon operations of the company caused by the actions of bank one and the ongoing litigation with bank one in have been dramatic 
first  the action of bank one in april  less than five months after it had entered into the credit facility agreement with the company and received substantial fees for the providing the credit facility of reducing the company s credit line to a point million below its then existing indebtedness and then calling for payment of that million within thirty days had the effect of totally cutting off any additional funds to the company to support company operations 
further  the funds loaned to the company by bank one had been used to refinance the company s indebtedness and no funds were then available to pay this large repayment obligation to bank one  even if such action by the bank was proper  which the company has vigorously and continually denied 
the principal reason the company had entered into the bank one credit agreement was to provide for additional funds to promote the growth of the company 
consequently  as a result of bank one s unwarranted actions no additional funds under the credit facility agreement were available in for additional drilling that the company had anticipated performing in the swan creek field and which were critical to the development of that field 
in order for overall field production to remain steady or grow in a field such as the swan creek field  new wells must be brought online 
any of the new wells drilled by the company would also experience a relatively steep initial decline curve followed by longer periods of relatively flat or stable production decline  as does every natural gas well in a formation similar to the knox formation  so continuous drilling is vital to maintaining or increasing earlier levels of production 
only two gas wells were added by the company in due to the destabilized lending arrangements caused by the actions of bank one and ongoing litigation 
second  the existence of the dispute with bank one  compounded by the fact that an effect of bank one s action was to cause the company s auditors to indicate that their was an uncertainty over the company s ability to continue as a going concern  has significantly discouraged other institutional lenders from considering a variety of additional or replacement financing options for drilling and other purposes that may have ordinarily been available to the company 
third  the dispute has caused bank one to fail to grant permission under the existing loan agreements with the company to permit the company to formulate drilling programs involving potential third party investors that may have permitted additional drilling to occur 
finally  the dispute has caused the company to incur significant legal fees to protect the company s rights 
the company believes that the total volume of the company s reserves in the swan creek field remains largely intact  and that these reserves can be extracted through existing wells and by steady additional drilling brought on by reliable financial arrangements 
the company plans to drill as many as twenty additional wells in the heart of this field and has obtained approval from the tennessee regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over spacing of wells to drill on smaller spacing units in the field  effectively allowing more wells to be drilled and the reservoir to produce more quickly but with no decrease in the long term efficiency of production of the maximum amount of reserves from the reservoir 
the company is hopeful that production from these new wells will be in line with the production from its more productive existing wells in the swan creek field and will have a noticeable effect on increasing the total production from the field 
although no assurances can be made  the company believes that it will either be able to resolve the bank one dispute or obtain additional or replacement financing to allow drilling to increase  and that once new wells are drilled  production from the swan creek field will increase 
however  no assurances can be made that such financing will be obtained or that overall produced volumes will increase 
similarly  when funding for additional drilling becomes available  the company plans to drill wells in five new locations it has identified in ellis and rush counties  kansas on its existing leases in response to drilling activity in the area establishing new areas of oil production 
although the company successfully drilled the dick no 
well in kansas in and completed the well as an oil well  it was not able to drill any new wells in kansas in due to lack of funds available for such drilling caused by the bank one situation 
as with tennessee  the company is hopeful that once the bank one matter is resolved it will be able to resume drilling and well workovers in kansas to maximize production from the kansas properties 
as of december   the company had total stockholders equity of  on total assets of  the company has a net working capital deficiency at december  of  as compared to a net deficiency of  at december  this working capital deficiency arises primarily from the acceleration of  of the bank one credit facility debt discussed above

the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the company s financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
full cost method of accounting the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and non productive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves for each cost center are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical work  daily rentals and the costs of drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells 
the company capitalized   and  of these costs in  and  respectively 
costs  however  associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and gas properties 
gains or losses are recognized only upon sales or dispositions of significant amounts of oil and gas reserves representing an entire cost center 
proceeds from all other sales or dispositions are treated as reductions to capitalized costs 
oil and gas reserves depletion depreciation and amortization of oil and gas properties the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated costs of plugging and abandonment  net of estimated salvage value  are amortized on the unit of production method based on total proved reserves 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated  subject to an annual assessment of whether impairment has occurred 
the company s proved oil and gas reserves as at december  were estimated by ryder scott  lp  petroleum consultants 
the company s discounted present value of its proved oil and gas reserves requires subjective judgments 
estimates of the company s reserves are in part forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is also reasonably possible that the company s estimate of discounted net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly this will result in a reduction of the valuation of the company s reserves 
this past year  ryder scott based on production results and the increase of oil and gas prices  increased the company s estimated value of reserves of gas in the swan creek field from its reserve report for the year ended december  see  item description of property reserve analysis 
contingencies the company accounts for contingencies in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to the issuance of the company s financial statements indicate that it is probable an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as environmental  legal and income tax matters requires management of the company to use its judgment 
while management of the company believes that the company s accrual for these matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different from the estimated loss  the company s results of operations may be over or understated 
the primary area in which the company has to estimate contingent liabilities is with respect to legal actions brought against the company

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue 
monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
as required by its credit agreement with bank one  the company entered into hedge agreements on december  on notional volumes of oil and natural gas production for the first six months of in order to manage some exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
realized gains or losses from the company s price risk management activities will be recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs 
notional volumes associated with the company s derivative contracts are  barrels and  mmbtu s for oil and natural gas  respectively 
the company does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
these hedge agreements expired in june and have not been renewed 
hedging activities resulted in a loss to the company of approximately  for the year ended december  interest rate risk at december   the company had debt outstanding of approximately million 
the interest rate on the revolving credit facility of million is variable based on the financial institution s prime rate plus 
the remaining debt of million has fixed interest rates ranging from to 
as a result  the company s annual interest costs in fluctuated based on short term interest rates on approximately of its total debt outstanding at december  the impact on interest expense and the company s cash flows of a percent increase in the financial institution s prime rate approximately basis points would be approximately  assuming borrowed amounts under the credit facility remain at million 
the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at december  forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can also affect these risks 
additionally  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged period of low prices  may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
