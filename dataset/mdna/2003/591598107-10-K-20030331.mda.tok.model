item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net loss applicable to common stockholders for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  down from net income applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share in the decrease in net income is primarily due to the increase in the net principal charge off rate from in to in  and lower excess spread due to higher default rates in the master trust 
the annual principal default rate in the master trust during was compared to in net interest income decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for year ended december  the decrease is due to a decrease in average interest earning assets of million and a basis point reduction in net interest margin 
the decrease in margin is primarily due to a basis point decrease in yield resulting from a million reduction in average credit card loans and retained interests in securitized loans  and a basis point reduction in the prime rate during the past year 
for the year ended december   of our average interest earning assets were in credit card loans and retained interests in loans securitized  compared to for the year ended december  the provision for loan losses was million in compared to million in the increase relates to the estimated required balance in the allowance for loan losses to cover future charge offs inherent in our loan portfolio 
increased net principal charge offs  recent delinquency and collection trends  and current economic conditions were factors considered by management in determining the necessary balance in the allowance for loan losses 
the net principal charge off rate was in compared to in the increase in the net principal charge off rate is partially due to the sale of approximately million of delinquent receivables in the sale resulted in a charge off of million 
the weak economic environment and the effects of the company s credit line increase program on the severity of credit losses also adversely affected the net charge off rate 
other operating income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in net securitization and credit card servicing income to million in the decrease in net securitization revenue was primarily due to a decrease in excess spread as a result of an increased default rate on securitized receivables 
credit card fees  interchange and other credit card income decreased to million in  compared to million in the decrease in credit card fees  interchange and other credit card income is due to the reduction of our credit card portfolio primarily due to the transfer of approximately billion of receivables from direct merchants bank to the master trust 
in addition  we also amended the master trust core transaction documents  which resulted in interchange income earned on receivables held by the master trust to be recorded as contribution to the excess spread earned  effective june in  million of interchange income was earned by the master trust 
enhancement services revenue increased to million due primarily to a rate increase on our debt waiver products and increased active enrollments in various membership products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in serviceedge revenue due to the run off of the serviceedge portfolio and a decrease in purchaseshield revenue due to decreased enrollments 

table of contents other operating expenses increased to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to a million increase in credit card account and other product solicitation and marketing expenses  a million increase in enhancement services claims expense 
during  we recorded approximately million write down of excess property  equipment  operating leases  and the pending sale of our arizona building and approximately million of marketing and origination costs on our retail note program 
in addition  we recorded a million write down of portfolios of charged off loans purchased in and critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are identified on pages of this report  the most significant of which are our determination of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of retained interests  and accounting for deferred acquisition costs and deferred revenue on enhancement services products 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb anticipated probable loan losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
at the time of charge off  all principal balances are written off against the allowance and all fees and finance charges are netted against the applicable income statement line item 
the allowance is based on management s consideration of all relevant factors  including management s assessment of applicable economic and seasonal trends 
we segment the loan portfolio into several individual liquidating pools with similar credit risk and time since solicitation vintage pools  and estimate based on historical experience and existing economic conditions the dollar amount of principal  accrued finance charges and fees in each day delinquency bucket that will not be collected and  therefore  roll into the next day bucket and ultimately charge off 
we then aggregate these pools into prime and subprime portfolios based on the prescribed fico score cuts  and into several other groups such as credit counseling and payment alternative receivables 
we also isolate individual pools subsequent to solicitation when the credit risk associated with the pools includes higher risk segments  such as our secured card program  accounts that are over their credit limit by more than and other programs as deemed necessary 
we separately analyze the reserve requirement on each of these groups or portfolios 
the impact on the allowance for loan losses for accounts in suspended status under our debt waiver benefits is included in the vintage pool roll rate analysis 
we continually evaluate the homogenous liquidating risk pools using a roll rate model which uses historical delinquency levels and pay down levels months of historical data  with influence given to the last six months performance to capture current economic and seasonal trends  loan seasoning and other measures of asset quality to estimate charge offs for both credit loss and bankruptcy losses 
additionally  in evaluating the adequacy of the loan loss reserves  we consider several subjective factors which may be overlaid into the credit risk roll rate model in determining the necessary loan loss reserve  including national and economic trends and business conditions  including the condition of various market segments  changes in lending policies and procedures  including those for underwriting  collection  charge off and recovery  as well as changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending management and staff  trends in volume and the product pricing of accounts  including any concentrations of credit  and impacts from external factors such as  changes in competition  and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
significant changes in these factors could impact our financial projections and thereby affect the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 

table of contents valuation of retained interests we determine the fair value of the net retained interests in loan securitized by calculating the present value of future expected cash flows using management s best estimate of key assumptions including credit losses  gross yield  interest expense  servicing fees  payment rates and a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
our fair value analysis considers cash flows associated with the current receivable balances as of the balance sheet date 
we assume no new sales or increases in outstanding receivables in conjunction with the accounts in the portfolio 
the significant assumptions are applied to the existing receivable balance to determine the expected future cash flows 
our funding costs are primarily variable based on the london interbank offered rate libor  and the income earned on our receivable balance is substantially variable based on prime 
we assume a flat interest rate environment and when interest rates change  we assume our assets and liabilities will reprice in a consistent manner 
our estimate of the assumptions considers several subjective factors  including national and economic trends and business conditions  including the condition of various market segments  changes in lending policies and procedures  including those for underwriting  collection  charge off and recovery  as well as changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending management and staff  trends in volume and the product pricing of accounts  including any concentrations of credit  and impacts from external factors  such as changes in competition  and legal and regulatory requirements 
furthermore  we consider the impact of conduit asset backed transaction enhancement levels and restrictions on the release of cash from the master trust due to spread triggers see page of this report for further discussion on the timing of our cash receipts from the master trust 
significant changes in these factors could impact our financial projections and thereby affect the valuation of the retained interests 
the significant assumptions used for estimating the fair value of the retained interests in loans securitized are as follows at december  annual discount rate monthly payment rate gross yield annual interest expense and servicing fees annual gross principal default rate includes finance charges  late and overlimit fees and bad debt recoveries  net of finance charge and fee charge offs 
gross yield for purposes of our valuation does not include interchange income  debt waiver fees  or cash advance fees 

table of contents at december   the sensitivity of the current fair value of the retained interests to immediate and adverse changes are as follows in millions impact on fair value adverse change adverse change annual discount rate monthly payment rate gross yield annual interest expense and servicing fees annual gross principal default rate as the sensitivity indicates  the value of the company s retained interests on its balance sheet  as well as reported earnings  could differ significantly if different assumptions or conditions prevail 
deferred acquisition costs on enhancement services products we defer qualifying acquisition costs associated with our enhancement services products 
these costs  which relate directly to membership solicitations direct response advertising costs  principally include postage  printing  mailing telemarketing costs  and commissions paid to third parties 
the total amount of enhancement services deferred costs as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
if deferred acquisition costs were to exceed forecasted future cash flows  we would make an appropriate adjustment for impairment 
the most significant assumption used by the company in determining the realizability of these deferred costs is future revenues from our enhancement services products 
a significant reduction in revenues could have a material impact on the values of these balances 
debt waiver products qualifying membership acquisition costs are deferred and charged to expense as debt waiver product fees are recognized 
we amortize these costs using an accelerated methodology  which approximates our historical cancellation experience for debt waiver products

those incremental direct acquisition costs  which are a result of a contract that is not consummated  are charged to expense as incurred 
a successful effort conversion percentage is applied to these incremental direct acquisition costs  which approximates our historical successful effort rate percentage in negotiating warranty products 
we amortize these deferred costs using an accelerated amortization methodology  which approximates our historical cancellation experience following the expiration of the manufacturer s contractual cancellation period for the warranty products

the average age of our credit card portfolio affects the stability of delinquency and loss rates 
in order to minimize losses  we continue to focus our resources on refining our credit underwriting standards for new accounts  and on collections and post charge off recovery efforts 
at december   of our outstanding receivables balance was from accounts that have been with us in excess of two years  and of outstanding receivables were with us in excess of four years 
we use credit line analyses  account management and customer transaction authorization procedures to minimize loan losses 
our risk models determine initial credit lines at the time of underwriting 
we manage credit lines on an ongoing basis and adjust them based on customer usage and payment patterns 
we continually monitor customer accounts and initiate appropriate collection activities when an account is delinquent or overlimit 
delinquencies delinquencies not only have the potential to affect earnings in the form of net loan losses  but they also are costly in terms of the personnel and other resources dedicated to their resolution 
it is our policy to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts  except in limited circumstances  until we charge off the account 
beginning in november  we stopped billing late fees once an account became days contractually delinquent 
past due accounts are re aged to current status only after we receive at least three minimum payments or the equivalent cumulative amount

net charge offs exclude accrued finance charges and fees  which are charged off against the applicable income statement line item at the time of charge off 
we charge off and take accounts as a loss either within days after formal notification of bankruptcy  at the end of the month during which most unsecured accounts become contractually days past due  at the end of the month during which unsecured accounts that have entered into a credit counseling or other similar program and later become contractually days past due  or at the end of the month during which secured accounts become contractually days past due after first reducing the loss by the secured deposit

table of contents provision and allowance for loan losses we record provisions for loan losses in amounts necessary to maintain the allowance at a level sufficient to absorb anticipated probable loan losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the economy has exhibited a significant slowdown over the last two years 
some of the actions we are taking to mitigate this slowdown include expanding our collections strategies to aggressively address any potential delinquency increases and utilizing our recovery staff to work on precharge off receivables 
we also leverage forbearance programs and credit counseling services for qualifying cardholders that are experiencing payment difficulties 
these programs include reduced interest rates  reduced or suspended fees and other incentives to induce the customer to continue making payments 
the amount of customer receivables in debt forbearance programs was million or of total credit card loans as of december   compared to million or of total credit card loans as of december  the provision for loan losses for the year ended december   totaled million compared to a provision of million in the increase in the provision for loan losses in compared to reflects an increase in delinquencies throughout  excluding the impact of the sales of approximately delinquent receivables  and the current economic environment

the projected decrease in excess spreads is primarily due to an increase in projected gross principal default rates 
the projected gross principal default rate increased from as of december  to as of december  the increase in the projected gross principal default rate was due to increased delinquencies in the master trust  increased loss severity due to the company s credit line increase program and overall deterioration in the economy

we entered into interest rate swap transactions through direct merchants bank 
the swaps were used to convert a portion of the fixed rate cds to variable rate cds and  thus  hedge the fair market value of the cds 
the cds experience fluctuating fair value in rising or declining interest rate environments 
by converting the fixed payment to a variable payment  the interest rate swaps effectively reduce the variability of the fair market value of the cds 
as of december   there were no interest rate swaps outstanding

the net excess spread on a cash basis for the master trust was for the month ended february  the three month average net excess spread on a cash basis was as of february  the master trust and the associated off balance sheet debt provide for early amortization if certain events occur 
these events are described in the applicable prospectus of each securitization transaction 

table of contents the significant events are i one month and three month average excess spreads below certain levels  ii negative transferor s interest within the master trust or iii failure to obtain funding during an accumulation period for a maturing term asset backed securitization 
in addition  there are various triggers within our securitization agreements that  if broken  would restrict the release of cash to us from the master trust 
this restricted cash provides additional security to the investors in the master trust 
we reflect cash restricted from release in the master trust as other receivables due from credit card securitizations  net in the consolidated balance sheet 
the triggers are related to the performance of the master trust  specifically the average of net excess spread over a one to three month period 
the following table illustrates the maximum amount of cash as a percentage of outstanding securitized principal receivables that could be held by the master trust as additional collateral if the one month and three month average excess spread of the master trust was within various ranges maximum cash basis net excess spread restricted greater than less than the cash restricted from release is limited to the amount of excess spread generated in the master trust on a cash basis 
during periods of lower excess spreads  the required amount of excess spread to be restricted in the master trust may not be achieved 
during those periods  all excess spread normally released to mri will be restricted from release 
once the maximum required amount of cash is restricted from release or excess spreads improve  cash can again be released from the spread accounts 
based on the performance of our master trust  the amount of cash required to be restricted was million at december  and million at february  as of december   million has been restricted from release in the master trust due to performance and million has been restricted from release in the master trust due to corporate debt ratings

the series c preferred stock has a dividend payable in additional shares of series c preferred stock and will also receive any cash dividends paid on the company s common stock on a converted basis 
one share of series c preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock  plus a premium amount designed to guarantee a portion of seven years worth of dividends at a annual rate 
for conversions in  the premium amount would be equal to approximately of those future dividends 
assuming conversion of the series c preferred stock into common stock  thl partners would own approximately of the company on a diluted basis at december  so long as affiliates of thl partners own at least of the originally issued series c preferred stock or any shares of common stock issued upon conversion thereof  the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of the series c preferred stock are entitled to elect four members to mci s board of directors 
the series c preferred stock may be redeemed by us in certain circumstances by paying of the redemption price of and all accrued dividends at the time of redemption 
we also have the option to redeem the series c preferred stock after december   without restriction by paying the redemption price of and all accrued dividends at the time of redemption 
the internal revenue service irs has recently completed its examination of the company s tax returns through december  the irs has proposed adjustments to increase the company s federal income tax by million  plus interest of more than million  pertaining to the company s treatment of certain credit card fees as original issue discount oid 
although these fees are primarily reported as income when billed for financial reporting purposes  we believe the fees constitute oid and must be deferred and amortized over the life of the underlying credit card receivables for tax purposes 
cumulatively through the year ended december   the company has deferred more than million in federal income tax under the oid rules 
the company believes its treatment of the fees is appropriate and continues to work with the irs to resolve the proposed adjustments 
the company s position on the treatment of credit card fees is consistent with that of many other us credit card issuers 
we do not expect any additional tax to be paid or settlement to be reached over the next twelve months 
however  both the timing and amount of the final resolution of this matter is uncertain 

table of contents the federal reserve act imposes various legal limitations on the extent to which banks that are members of the federal reserve system can finance or otherwise supply funds to certain of their affiliates 
in particular  direct merchants bank is subject to certain restrictions on any extensions of credit to mci or its subsidiaries 
additionally  direct merchants bank is limited in its ability to declare dividends to mci or its subsidiaries 
therefore  direct merchants bank s investments in federal funds sold are generally not available for the general liquidity needs of the company or its subsidiaries 
since the later part of  our corporate debt ratings  the master trust ratings and the ratings of direct merchants bank have been downgraded 
these downgrades reflect the losses we experienced in  as well as deteriorating performance in the master trust 
these downgrades and any future downgrades will have a negative effect on our ability to obtain funding 
in addition  access to funding may be at a higher cost and on terms less favorable to us than those previously available as a result of the deterioration in our financial performance and asset quality 
our deposits and secured unsecured debt are rated by moody s investor services moody s standard poor s rating services s p and fitch  inc fitch 
factors affecting the various ratings include the overall health of the global national economy  specific economic conditions impacting the subprime consumer finance industry  and the overall financial performance of the company  including earnings  credit losses  delinquencies  excess spreads in the master trust and our overall liquidity 
furthermore  certain of our term asset backed securitizations require the restriction of cash if our corporate debt ratings go below certain levels 
the table below illustrates the current debt ratings of mci and direct merchants bank moody s standard poor s fitch metris companies inc senior unsecured debt b ccc ccc credit facility b b ccc direct merchants bank short term deposits ba b long term deposits ba b moody s  s p and fitch have a negative outlook for us and our debt ratings 
the rating agencies cited concerns about our funding and liquidity challenges  earnings and asset quality 
during the first quarter of  we continue to experience pressure on our liquidity position 
as part of our commitment to meet the goals under our strategic plan  management is implementing measures to maintain strong levels of liquidity 
on march  we obtained a million extension through march of an million conduit which was scheduled to mature in june of we also secured a million conduit through march  which will replace conduits and warehouse facilities scheduled to mature during march through may furthermore  these conduits will provide for the financing of a term asset backed securitization that is scheduled to mature in july the availability of funding under these facilities is subject to various conditions  including a net reduction of receivables in the master trust and a minimum three month average excess spread of 
in connection with the transactions  we also terminated our million revolving line of credit 
on march  the company and direct merchants bank entered into an operating agreement with the occ 
the operating agreement requires  among other things  the following the bank must reduce its on balance sheet credit card receivables to no more than million by december  and to zero by december  during the time the bank is reducing these receivables  the mix of subprime receivables may not exceed of all credit card receivables 
as of december   of the bank s credit card portfolio was subprime 
the bank will continue to sell credit card receivables on a daily basis to mci under the purchase agreement currently in effect between mci and the bank 

table of contents the bank must maintain minimum capital in the aggregate amount of i liquid assets deposited pursuant to the liquidity reserve deposit agreement discussed below  ii the capital required as a result of the risk weight applied to on book subprime credit card receivables  and iii the minimum capital required under federal law for a well capitalized institution for all remaining assets owned by the bank 
the bank must meet certain liquidity requirements  including maintaining  on a daily basis  liquid assets of not less than of the deposits and other liabilities coming due within the next days  maintaining marketable assets in an amount equal to or in excess of the bank s insured deposits  maintaining cash and cash equivalents in excess of of outstanding cds and entering into the liquidity reserve deposit agreement discussed below to support the bank s credit card receivables funding needs 
the terms of the operating agreement required direct merchants bank and mci to enter into a capital assurance and liquidity maintenance agreement calma which also was executed on march  the effect of the calma is to require mci to make such capital infusions or provide direct merchants bank with financial assistance so as to permit direct merchants bank to meet its liquidity requirements 
the operating agreement requires direct merchants bank  a third party depository bank and the occ to execute a liquidity reserve deposit agreement lrda within days of the effective date of the operating agreement 
upon entering into the operating agreement  direct merchants bank declared and paid a dividend of million to us on march  furthermore  the agreement allows direct merchants bank to declare and pay future dividends without prior approval by the occ  provided such dividends are in compliance with occ regulations 
during the past fiscal year  we had in place a million term loan and revolving credit facility 
in connection with the conduit transactions discussed above  all availability under the million revolving portion of this facility was terminated as of march   with the exception of the million of outstanding letters of credit 
term loans of million remain outstanding under the facility and mature on june  in order to refinance the facility in part  on march   thl fund iv committed to provide a term loan to the company in an aggregate amount of million as a backup financing facility  secured by assets of the company 
the backup facility carries an interest rate of per annum plus an option to earn an additional meaningful economic return based on the performance of the company s managed receivables through december  the backup facility would be repayable in full on march  thl fund iv s obligation to loan funds to the company is subject to a number of conditions  including the requirement that the company receive an opinion or opinions satisfactory to thl fund iv that the new credit facility is fair  from a financial point of view to the company and to the holders of the company s outstanding notes 
there can be no assurance that these conditions will be met 
as previously noted  during we have contractual cash obligations of million  off balance sheet funding scheduled to amortize of billion and will require funding for a million term asset backed securitization maturing in january in addition  we will need cash to fund new receivables  for the reduction of credit card loans at direct merchants bank to no more than million at december  required under our operating agreement and for general operating needs 
we have historically utilized a variety of funding vehicles  as well as ongoing cash generated from operations  to finance credit card receivable growth  maturing debt obligations and general operating needs 
during the next year we intend to shrink the size of the credit receivables in the master trust by approximately billion through lower credit card account acquisitions  attrition in the portfolio and third party sales as necessary 
this reduction in the size of the portfolio will significantly reduce our need for additional bank conduits or the issuance of new asset backed securities 
we believe we have adequate liquidity for meeting anticipated cash needs  although no assurance can be given to that effect 

table of contents capital adequacy in the normal course of business  direct merchants bank enters into agreements  or is subject to regulatory requirements  that result in cash  debt  dividend or other capital restrictions 
the federal reserve act imposes various legal limitations on the extent to which banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to their affiliates 
in particular  direct merchants bank is subject to certain restrictions on any extensions of credit to or other covered transactions  such as certain purchases of assets  with mci and its affiliates 
such restrictions limit direct merchants bank s ability to lend to mci and its affiliates 
additionally  direct merchants bank is limited in its ability to pay dividends to us in accordance with the national bank dividend provisions 
direct merchants bank is subject to certain capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the occ 
at december  and  direct merchants bank s tier risk based capital ratio  risk based total capital ratio and tier leverage ratio exceeded the minimum required capital levels  and direct merchants bank was considered a well capitalized depository institution under regulations of the occ  as illustrated in the table below 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  direct merchants bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
direct merchants bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require direct merchants bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the following table of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and of tier leverage capital as defined to average assets as defined 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material adverse effect on our financial statements 
additional information about direct merchants bank s actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table to be adequately to be well actual capitalized capitalized as of december  amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets to be adequately to be well actual capitalized capitalized as of december  amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets ffiec guidelines indicate that an institution with a concentration in subprime lending should hold one and one half to three times the normal minimum capital required

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our principal market risk is due to changes in interest rates 
this affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities  as well as indirectly  as interest rates may impact the payment performance of our cardholders 
to manage our direct risk to market interest rates  management actively monitors the interest rates and the interest sensitive components of our owned and managed balance sheet to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets  net income and cash flow 
we seek to minimize that impact primarily by matching asset and liability repricings 
our primary managed assets are credit card loans  which are virtually all priced at rates indexed to the variable prime rate 
we fund credit card loans through a combination of cash flows from operations  asset securitizations  bank loans  subsidiary bank deposits  long term debt and equity issuances 
our securitized loans are owned by the master trust and bank sponsored single seller and multi seller receivables conduits within the master trust  which have committed funding primarily indexed to variable commercial paper rates and libor 
our million bank credit facility consists of a million revolving credit facility that is indexed to prime rate and a million term loan that is indexed to libor 
effective march   the million revolving credit facility was terminated 
the long term debt is at fixed interest rates 
at december   none of the securities issued out of the master trust and conduit funding of securitized receivables was funded with fixed rate securities  compared to at december  in an interest rate environment with rates significantly above current rates  the potential negative impact on earnings of higher interest expense is partially mitigated by fixed rate funding and interest rate cap contracts 
the approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis  which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business 
this approach calculates the impact on net income from an instantaneous and sustained change in interest rates of basis points 
assuming that we take no counteractive measures  as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates affecting our floating rate financial instruments  including both debt obligations and loans  would result in a decrease in net income of approximately million relative to a base case over the next months  compared to an approximate million increase as of december  relative to a base case over the next months 
a decrease of basis points would result in an increase in net income of approximately million as of december   and an increase of million as of december  the year over year changes in the sensitivity to a basis point increase and decrease in the market interest rate is mainly due to increased loan balances in fixed rate price programs  such as forbearance programs  promotional rate programs and introductory rate programs  as well as floors placed on interest rates charged to customers in you should not construe our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of financial instruments as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
in addition  this methodology does not take into account the indirect impact interest rates may have on the payment performance of our cardholders  or the fact that libor and prime rates may not move in tandem in an increasing or decreasing rate environment 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account operating transactions or other costs associated with managing immediate changes in interest rates

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income applicable to common stockholders for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  up from net income applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share in the increase in net income results from an increase in net interest income and other operating income partially offset by increases in the provision for loan losses and other operating expenses 
the provision for loan losses was million in compared to million in the increase relates to the estimated required balance in the allowance for loan losses to cover future charge offs inherent in our loan portfolio 
increased credit card loans  increased net principal charge offs  recent delinquency and collection trends  and current economic conditions were factors considered by management in determining the necessary balance in the allowance for loan losses 
the net principal charge off rate was in compared to in the decrease in the net principal charge off rate is due to run off of our secured portfolio 
the delinquency ratio was in compared to in other operating income increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in net securitization and credit card servicing income of million to million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in servicing revenue and the change in retained interests valuation expense needed to record the retained interests at fair value 
servicing revenue increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  caused by an increase of the approximately billion in average securitized receivables 
the retained interests valuation expense decreased million for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  enhancement services revenues increased to million in  up from million in these increases were primarily due to the growth in total credit card accounts  an increase in outstanding receivables in the securitized credit card loan portfolio  development of new third party relationships and the creation of new products 
other operating expenses increased to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to continued investments in our infrastructure in order to service the growth in our credit card loan portfolio  an increase in overall marketing expenditures and increased amortization on purchased portfolio premiums 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
sfas requires enterprises to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and to measure those instruments at fair value 
prior to sfas no 
 we amortized the costs of interest rate contracts on a straight line basis over the expected life of the contract 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a one time  non cash  after tax charge to earnings of million reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  
table of contents during the quarter ended march  we adopted staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  for our debt waiver products 
this sab formalized the accounting for services sold where the right to a full refund exists  requiring all companies to defer recognition of revenues until the cancellation period is complete 
previously  we recognized half of the revenues in the month billed and half in the following month 
we now recognize all of the revenue the month following completion of the cancellation period 
this change resulted in a one time  non cash net charge to earnings of million  which is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  because we have applied the provisions of this sab to our membership programs since  before the sec formalized its guidance  we did not have to adjust our enhancement services revenues 
selected operating data managed basis in addition to analyzing the company s performance on an owned basis  we analyze the company s financial performance on a managed loan portfolio basis

the credit line increase program added pressure to our cardholders due to increased average outstanding balances  which require higher monthly payments 
this  along with a deteriorating economy  has made collection efforts more difficult  resulting in higher delinquencies
