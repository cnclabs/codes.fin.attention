item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following table summarizes income from continuing operations  net income and basic and diluted earnings per share for the twelve months ended december amounts in thousands income from continuing operations    net income    basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share vs 
strategic initiatives we pursued in recent years  including diversifying our sources of business  focusing on what we believe are attractive and growing core markets and managing for long term shareholder value generated favorable results in  particularly in the third and fourth quarters 
net income for rose percent  to million  or per common share on a diluted basis  compared with million  or per share for our growth in earnings was primarily due to net income from insurance operations of million  reflecting the acquisition of milne scali in april the results included income from discontinued operations of our former fargo  nd branch office of per share in  and a loss of per share from such operations in the results also included extraordinary charges of per share on early extinguishment of debt and for cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
net interest income remained relatively constant  at million in both and net interest income included mark to market losses on the value of derivative contracts totaling  in and  in these losses are subject to fluctuations based on changes in interest rates and the associated value of the derivative contracts 
excluding the impact of the mark to market losses  net interest income would have increased percent year over year 
demonstrating the benefits of our diverse business base  noninterest income was up percent year over year  to million for noninterest income represented percent of gross revenues this year  increasing substantially from percent in  and exceeding our internal target of percent 
insurance commissions  largely produced by milne scali  were the largest component of noninterest income in loan fees  gains on sales of securities and service charges also increased compared to  while brokerage and trust financial services income declined 
noninterest expense was million  an increase of nearly percent versus this primarily reflected our expanded banking and insurance operations in arizona and the winding down of the fargo office of our bnc ami subsidiary actions that are expected to enhance profitability in the future 
in any event  the rate of growth in both net income and noninterest income exceeded the rise in noninterest expense 
total assets reached million at december   up percent from a year ago 
total loans increased by percent  to million at the end of  while total deposits rose percent to million 
all stated amounts reflect continuing operations 
reflecting the success of our expansion into new markets  the arizona operations of the bank accounted for approximately percent of total loans and percent of total deposits at the end of maintaining sound asset quality continued to be a focus for us 
the provision for credit losses was million for versus million for the prior year 
loan charge offs in were  or about one half the level of the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans at the end of was percent  nearly even with percent one year ago 
the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was percent at december   compared with the year end level of percent 
the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total nonperforming loans was percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
total common stockholders equity was approximately million at december   equivalent to book value per common share of tangible book value per common share of 
net unrealized gains in our investment portfolio as of december  were nearly million  or approximately per share  on a pretax basis 
during  we undertook a series of actions to sharpen the focus and strengthen the performance of each of our three core businesses banking  insurance and brokerage trust financial services 
in banking  we sold our fargo  nd branch allowing us to redeploy our resources in markets we believe present greater potential for profitability 
in insurance  the acquisition of milne scali in the second quarter of significantly increased the scale of our insurance business and that business has already begun to generate encouraging earnings 
in brokerage trust financial services  in order to enhance the financial options available to our customers  we formed a relationship with raymond james financial services  inc we also reorganized the management and office network of bnc ami to improve the productivity of this aspect of our business 
we believe that we have achieved our goal of building a diversified business base  which has long been a cornerstone of our strategy 
we believe each of our core businesses is now well defined and well positioned to serve the needs of our customers  while contributing to our long term corporate financial performance and share value creation 
we believe that our record financial performance in the third and fourth quarters of provides a meaningful indication of our earnings potential 
of the million in net income we recorded for the year  most was generated during the second half of the year 
looking ahead to  we expect to derive a full year of benefit from our investments in expanding our insurance operations  implementing programs to encourage cross selling across all of our business lines and controlling overhead 
vs 
we reported income from continuing operations of million for  or per share on a diluted basis 
this compares with income from continuing operations for of million  or per share 
the results for reflected double digit growth in both net interest income and noninterest income  but also higher noninterest expense due to the establishment of our tempe  arizona operations and the issuance of trust preferred securities 
net income for was million  or per share on a diluted basis  after a loss on operations of our discontinued fargo  nd branch of  an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of per share and a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of per share 
for  net income was nearly million  or per share  although this reflected a gain on disposal of our asset based lending subsidiary of per share  a loss of per share from operations of the discontinued fargo  n 
d branch and a gain on early extinguishment of debt of per share 
our results for reflected our strategic diversification of revenue sources and active asset liability management 
net interest income increased percent to million  as we continued to shift our earning asset mix from investment securities to loans while growing the deposit base 
gains generated through management of the investment portfolio were reflected in noninterest income  which rose percent to million 
other noninterest income items  including loan fees  insurance commissions and income from brokerage  trust and financial services  held relatively stable or declined slightly 
noninterest expense was million for  a percent increase from the previous year  again reflecting our arizona initiative and expenses related to trust preferred securities 
in particular  we view the cost of operations such as our arizona operations as an important investment in growth 
unlike many companies  we have typically expanded by establishing wholly new operations rather than making acquisitions 
in these particular cases  we record the investment needed to operate in new markets as an expense  whereas companies that depend on acquisition for growth are able to recognize much of their entry cost as goodwill 
the benefits of our investment in building new markets were evident in our strong loan and deposit growth during total loans rose percent during the twelve months ended december   reaching million 
total deposits increased percent over the level  to million at december  significantly  some percent of the new loan volume and percent of the deposit increase were generated by our new arizona operations 
total assets increased million to million at december  responding to the weaknesses felt by many sectors of the nation s economy  we continued to focus on maintaining credit quality 
the provision for credit losses was increased to million in  from million for the prior year 
the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was percent at december   increasing slightly from percent one year earlier 
the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was percent at december   compared with percent at year end the ratio of allowance for credit losses to total nonperforming loans was percent at december   compared with percent one year earlier 
total common stockholders equity was approximately million at december   equivalent to book value per common share of tangible book value per common share of 
net unrealized gains in our investment portfolio as of december  were nearly million  or approximately per share  on a pretax basis 
results of operations net interest income 
net interest income  the difference between total interest income earned on interest earning assets and total interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  is the banking segment s primary source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of earning assets  the level of rates earned on those assets  the volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and the level of rates paid on those liabilities 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain information relating to our average balance sheet and reflects the yield on average assets and cost of average liabilities 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income and expense by the average balance of assets and liabilities 
all average balances have been derived from monthly averages  which are indicative of daily averages

the following table illustrates  for the periods indicated  the dollar amount of changes in our interest income and interest expense for the major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and distinguishes between the increase related to higher outstanding balances and the volatility of interest rates

net interest income analysis vs 
for the years ended december  change amounts in millions total interest income decreased due to decrease in yield on earnings assets driven by decreased yield on loans a decreased yield on investments b the decreased yields were offset by increased average earning assets driven by increase in average loans c offset by decrease in average investments d total interest expense decreased due to decrease in cost of interest bearing liabilities driven by decrease in cost of interest bearing deposits e decrease in cost of borrowings f these decreases in cost of interest bearing liabilities were offset by increase in average interest bearing liabilities driven by increase in average interest bearing deposits g offset by decrease in average borrowings h from continuing operations for all periods presented 
a our decreased loan yield is reflective of the significantly lower interest rate environment during the lower rate environment was caused by several federal reserve reductions in the federal funds target rate causing prime rate to decrease significantly during and continuing into the daily average prime rate in was percent as compared to percent for the lower prime rate caused floating rate loans to reprice at lower levels and new loans to be originated at levels lower than those originated in the prior period 
b the decreased yield on investments was also reflective of the lower interest rate environment during c the increase in average loans was driven primarily by loan growth in the arizona and minnesota markets 
d average investments declined as the portfolio was restructured to better manage our capital  shift our earning asset mix from investments to loans and to establish the proper forward looking risk reward profile for the investment portfolio 
e the decrease in cost of interest bearing deposits was reflective of the lower interest rate environment during floating rate deposit accounts repriced at lower levels and certificates of deposit renewed or were originated at lower levels than those in the prior period 
f borrowing costs decreased due to the lower rate environment during  the payoff of our percent subordinated notes during and the adjustment of the million floating rate subordinated debentures in response to the lower rates in borrowing costs in would have decreased to percent versus percent without factoring in the  impact of marking our interest rate cap contracts to fair value 
the fair value adjustments to the interest rate cap contracts were reflected as increases in borrowing costs 
g average interest bearing deposits increased largely due to further increases in volume of our wealthbuilder interest checking and money market accounts originating primarily in our arizona and minnesota markets 
h average borrowings decreased due to lower averages of short term borrowings  the pay down of million of fhlb advances in early  a continued shift in our funding base from borrowings to core deposits and the retirement of our subordinated notes  which were outstanding through august  net interest income and margin in future periods may be impacted by several factors 
changes in net interest income are dependent upon the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the movement of interest rates and the level of non performing assets 
achieving net interest margin growth is dependent on our ability to generate higher yielding assets and lower cost funding sources such as deposits and borrowings 
if variable index rates  such as the prime rate  were to decline  we could experience compression of our net interest margin depending upon the timing and amount of any reductions  as it is possible that interest rates paid on some deposits and borrowings may not decline as quickly  or to the same extent  as the decline in the yield on interest rate sensitive assets such as commercial and other loans 
competition for checking  savings and money market deposits  important sources of lower cost funds for us  is intense 
we could also experience net interest margin compression if rates paid on deposits and borrowings increase  or as a result of new pricing strategies and lower rates offered on loan products in response to competitive pressures  rates on interest bearing liabilities increase faster  or to a greater extent  than the increase in the yield on interest rate sensitive assets 
the level and nature of the impact cannot be precisely ascertained 
federal reserve actions in response to economic developments can vary causing prime and other rates to adjust and  in some cases  immediately impact our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these factors  including the competitive environment in the markets in which we operate  the multitude of financial and investment products available to the public and the monetary policies of the federal reserve  can materially impact our operating results 
therefore  we cannot predict  with any degree of certainty  prospects for net interest income and net interest margin in future periods 
see supervision and regulation  economic conditions and monetary policy economic conditions and monetary policy included under item of part i 
see also item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for information relating to the impact of fluctuating interest rates on our future net interest income prospects 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net interest income increased million  or percent  to million as compared to million 
net interest spread and net interest margin were and percent  respectively as compared to and percent for the prior period 
net interest income for the twelve month period ended december  reflected mark to market losses on the value of derivative contracts totaling 
without the mark to market adjustments on these derivative contracts net interest margin for the period would have been percent 
net interest income for the twelve month period ended december  reflected amortization of an interest rate floor contract totaling 
without this amortization expense net interest margin for the period would have been percent 
the cost of the interest rate floor contract was being amortized during because statement of financial accounting standards no

the following condensed information summarizes the major factors combining to create the changes to net interest income  spread and margin 
lettered explanations following the summary describe causes of the changes in these major factors net interest income analysis vs 
for the years ended december  change amounts in millions total interest income decreased due to decrease in yield on interest earnings assets 
driven by decrease in yield on loans a decrease in yield on investments b the decreases in yield on interest earning assets were offset by increase in average earning assets driven by increase in average loans c offset by decrease in average investments d total interest expense decreased due to decrease in cost of interest bearing liabilities driven by decrease in cost of interest bearing deposits e decrease in cost of borrowings f these decreases were coupled with decrease in average interest bearing liabilities driven by decrease in average borrowings g offset by increase in average interest bearing deposits h from continuing operations for all periods presented 
a the decreased loan yield is reflective of a basis point decrease in the prime rate over the course of as monetary policy eased in response to weakening national economic conditions 
floating rate loans tied to prime repriced lower and new loans originated during came on at lower rates than those originated during b the decreased investment yield reflects the lower rate environment in as well as the reduction in the size of the investment portfolio in order to shift the earning asset mix toward loans 
c loan growth was attributable to increases in loans originated in our arizona  minnesota and north dakota markets 
d average investments decreased due to the strategic shift in earning asset mix from investment securities to loans as lending opportunities arose in the arizona  minnesota and north dakota markets 
e decreased cost of interest bearing deposits is reflective of the rise in volume of wealthbuilder interest checking and money market accounts and the associated decreases in cost as interest rates declined during the wealthbuilder accounts carry rates that are variable at management s discretion 
management lowered the rates paid on these deposits in response to the monetary easing that took place during while maintaining the competitive nature of the wealthbuilder products in the company s various markets 
additionally  in a lower rate environment  the cost of certificates of deposit also decreases with renewals and new accounts 
f rates are reflective of the overall decreased rate environment in as compared to g we decreased our volume of fhlb advances due to greater use of national market certificates of deposit as a wholesale funding source in order to maintain borrowing capacity at the fhlb  support the earning asset base and take advantage of favorable costs of national market certificates of deposit relative to fhlb advances 
in addition  on august  we redeemed million of our percent subordinated notes due may  through the exercise of our call option 
h deposit growth was primarily attributable to the continued success of the wealthbuilder family of interest checking and money market accounts in addition to increased use of direct non brokered national market certificates of deposit obtained via posting rates on national networks 
national market certificates of deposit were million as of december  compared to on december  provision for credit losses 
we determine a provision for credit losses which we consider sufficient to maintain our allowance for credit losses at a level considered adequate to provide for an estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses in the remaining loan and lease portfolio that have been incurred as of each balance sheet date 
the provision for credit losses for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in and million in net loan and lease charge offs were  or percent of average loans and leases in compared with  or percent in and  or percent in the increase in provision and net charge offs in primarily reflected the impact of developments in our truck leasing portfolio and deterioration in performance of a number of our contracting customers 
the provision for credit losses is calculated as part of the determination of the allowance for credit losses and the related provision for credit losses is a critical accounting policy which involves consideration of a number of factors such as loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies in the loan and lease portfolio  the value of underlying collateral on problem loans  general economic conditions and our assessment of credit risk in the current loan and lease portfolio 
periodic fluctuations in the provision for credit losses result from our assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  however  actual loan losses may vary from current estimates 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december  compared with and million at december  and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item  financial condition loan portfolio allowance for credit losses and critical accounting policies for further discussion of the components of the allowance for credit losses  our systematic methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance and additional data pertaining to charge offs  recoveries and other related information 
noninterest income 
noninterest income is becoming a more significant source of revenues for us as we continue to emphasize our goal of focusing on local relationship banking and providing a broad range of financial products and services that will meet the needs of our customers  both commercial and consumer 
our noninterest income increased approximately million  or percent  in largely due to insurance commission income generated by milne scali  which we acquired in april fees on loans  net gain on sales of securities and service charges also increased in noninterest income increased approximately million  or percent  in primarily as a result of increases in net gains on sales of securities 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the major categories of our noninterest income as well as the amount and percent of change between each of the periods presented 
related information and significant changes are discussed in lettered explanations following the table noninterest income increase decrease for the years ended december  in thousands insurance commissions     a fees on loans    b net gain on sales of securities    c brokerage income    d service charges e trust and financial services  f rental income other total noninterest income      from continuing operations for all periods presented 
a insurance commissions 
in  insurance commissions increased dramatically due to the april  acquisition of milne scali 
in  insurance commissions declined in the face of a challenging economic environment and catastrophic weather related events in the north dakota market during that reduced and or eliminated contingency fees paid by insurance companies in we expect insurance commission income to increase during due to a full year of production by milne scali along with contingency fees generally received by milne scali in the first quarter of each year 
b fees on loans 
the increase in loan fees for is largely attributable to loans originated and sold on the secondary market 
loan volume generation and the related loan fees associated with such loans can be subject to significant fluctuations making it difficult to anticipate the amount of loans that will be originated or placed and related loan fees that will be recognized in future periods 
c net gain on sales of securities 
net gain on sales of securities in was primarily a result of repositioning the investment portfolio s forward looking risk reward profile 
net gain on sales of securities in was a function of selling investment securities in the process of shifting the earning asset mix from investment securities to loan opportunities available in new and existing markets 
in addition  given the significant decline in interest rates during  sales of investment securities were necessary in order to adjust the forward looking risk reward profile of the investment portfolio 
we cannot guarantee our ability to generate realized gains in the future such as those recognized during the most recent two years given the current absolute low level of interest rates 
in the future  the investment portfolio risk reward management process may require us to recognize net realized losses in order to optimize the forward looking profile of the portfolio 
d brokerage income 
in brokerage income declined as a result of market conditions and a decrease in the number of brokers at bnc ami  including the closing of bnc ami s fargo office in september 
in  brokerage income was relatively stable in the face of a challenging economic environment and a prolonged period of soft conditions in equity markets 
e service charges 
service charges increased in and as the company continued to increase its wealthbuilder interest checking and money market account volume along with an increase in non interest bearing deposits which are primarily business deposit relationships that tend to utilize a greater level of fee based deposit services 
f trust and financial services 
the and decreases in trust and financial services revenue are attributable to reduced fees from the bnc us opportunities fund llc as such fees are primarily a function of the asset size of the fund and the fund has decreased over the two periods 
the fund s size has been negatively impacted by the overall decline in equity markets in both years 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased approximately million  or percent  in primarily as a result of the milne scali acquisition and our expanding presence in the arizona market 
noninterest expense increased approximately million  or percent  in due to several factors including our entry into the arizona market 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the major categories of our noninterest expense as well as the amount and percent of change between each of the periods presented 
related information and significant changes are discussed in lettered explanations below the table noninterest expense increase decrease for the years ended december  in thousands salaries and employee benefits      a occupancy    b interest on subordinated debentures   c professional services    d depreciation and amortization   e office supplies  telephone and postage  f amortization of intangible assets g marketing and promotion h fdic and other assessments

average full time equivalents for each year in the three year period ended december  were  and  respectively 
b occupancy 
the increase reflects the addition of milne scali in april the increase in was primarily associated with newly occupied facilities due to the establishment of a banking subsidiary in arizona 
c interest on subordinated debentures 
this is the interest expense associated with our fixed rate subordinated debentures commonly referred to as trust preferred securities issued in july and the additional interest expense from our floating rate subordinated debentures issued in july the increase is primarily attributable to the million of subordinated debentures issued in july being outstanding for a full year during the increase in reflects a the full year expense of the july issuance along with five months of expense related to the july issuance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item for further information related to our subordinated debentures 
d professional services 
the increase in professional services represents increases in legal fees including those incurred by milne scali  software support fees and other consulting and investment banking fees

k noninterest expense divided by an amount equal to net interest income plus noninterest income 
l total operating expenses as a percent of average assets have increased as our profile has changed from that of a traditional banking organization to an organization with a broader base of financial product and service offerings the revenues and expenses of which are generally not asset based 
income taxes 
we recorded income tax expense of   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective tax rates were  and percent for the twelve month periods ended december   and  respectively 
the effective tax rates were lower than the statutory rates principally due to tax exempt income on municipal securities 
the determination of current and deferred income taxes is a critical accounting policy which is based on complex analyses of many factors including interpretations of federal and state income tax laws  the differences between tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities temporary differences  estimates of amounts due or owed such as the timing of reversal of temporary differences and current financial accounting standards 
actual results could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities

in  we began to strategically shift the larger earning asset base to loans from investment securities 
c loans and leases 
in  we increased our net loans and leases by strategically shifting our earning asset mix toward loans from investment securities 
the increase in net loans and leases reflected commercial real estate and real estate construction loans arising from opportunities in the arizona  minnesota and north dakota markets

our investment policy is designed to enhance net income and return on equity through prudent management of risk  ensure liquidity for cash flow requirements  help manage interest rate risk  ensure collateral is available for public deposits  advances and repurchase agreements and manage asset diversification 
in managing the portfolio  we seek a balance between current income yield and future market value volatility  while simultaneously managing credit and liquidity risks 
the goal of this process is to maximize our longer term profitability as well as the economic performance of the portfolio over the long term 
investments are centrally managed in order to maximize compliance federal laws and regulations place certain restrictions on the amounts and types of investments we may hold and effectiveness of overall investing activities 
the primary goal of our investment policy is to contribute to our overall profitability 
the objective is to purchase and own securities and combinations of securities with good risk reward characteristics 
good risk reward securities are those identified through thorough analysis of the cash flows and potential cash flows as well as market value and potential future market value of the security in question given various interest rate scenarios 
investment strategies are developed in light of a constant view of our overall asset liability position 
as it relates to investment strategies  the focus of our asset liability management committee alco is to determine the impact of interest rate changes on both future income and market value of securities in the portfolio

as of december   we had million of available for sale securities in the investment portfolio as compared to and million at december  and  respectively  based on fair value of the securities on those dates 
in the process of carrying out the portfolio management process objective to purchase securities and combinations of securities with good economic risk reward characteristics  we increased us government agency mortgage backed securities  us government agency securities and state and municipal bonds by million   and million  respectively and decreased cmos and corporate debt securities by and million  respectively 
the million reduction in corporate debt securities during allowed us to better manage our risk based capital ratios as such securities are risk weighted at percent for risk based capital purposes 
given our earnings in the third and fourth quarters  and the forecasted level of future earnings  we increased our holdings of state and municipal bonds by million in order to increase our level of tax exempt income in the future 
in addition to the role state and municipal bonds play in managing our tax position  state and municipal bonds offer an attractive risk reward profile particularly when considered in combination with other securities in the portfolio 
in addition  during  mortgage rates declined to their lowest levels in decades 
this decrease in mortgage rates increased the level of mortgage refinancing and prepayments for us government agency mortgage backed securities and cmos 
the ongoing portfolio management process and individual security risk reward analysis described above led to the sale of individual securities whose forward looking risk reward profiles given the lower interest rate and increased prepayment environment were inferior to other securities available for purchase 
this analysis and ongoing management of the portfolio s forward looking risk reward profile resulted in transactions that generated net realized securities gains of million during we cannot guarantee our ability to generate realized gains in the future such as those recognized during the most recent year given the current absolute low level of interest rates 
in the future  the risk reward management process may require us to recognize net realized losses in order to optimize the forward looking profile of the portfolio 
as part of the strategic shift in the earning asset mix from investment securities to loans in  we decreased our holdings in cmos  corporate bonds and state and municipal bonds by  and million  respectively 
in addition  as a result of basis points of monetary easing over the course of  the yield curve experienced a significant downward shift and increase in slope relative to the ongoing portfolio management process and individual security risk reward analysis described above led to the sale of individual securities whose forward looking risk reward profile given various interest rate scenarios was inferior to other securities available for purchase 
the need to optimize the risk reward profile of the portfolio as a whole in addition to the reduction in the portfolio size as more earning assets were shifted to loans resulted in transactions that generated net realized securities gains of million 
we cannot guarantee our ability to generate realized gains in the future such as those recognized during the most recent two years given the current absolute low level of interest rates 
in the future  the risk reward management process may require us to recognize net realized losses in order to optimize the forward looking profile of the portfolio 
during  we had increased our holdings in cmos  us government agency mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds by  and million  respectively as part of our strategy to increase our earning asset portfolio by purchasing investment securities primarily funded through fhlb borrowings 
the portfolio management process  investment objectives  and risk reward analysis described above led the increase in the investment portfolio to be over weighted toward cmos due to their risk reward characteristics 
in addition  over the course of  principal cash flows were primarily reinvested in cmos because they offered a better risk reward profile due to the structure of the cmo cash flows relative to mortgage backed securities 
at december   we held no securities of any single issuer  other than us government agency securities and agency mortgage backed securities and cmos  that exceeded ten percent of stockholders equity 
a significant portion of our investment securities portfolio approximately percent at december  was pledged as collateral for public deposits and borrowings  including borrowings with the fhlb 
federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock 
our equity securities consisted of million   and  of federal reserve bank frb stock at december   and  respectively and  and million of fhlb stock at december   and  respectively 
our holdings in frb stock have increased due to the amount of capital stock issued by the bank 
our holdings in fhlb stock fluctuate due to the level of fhlb advances outstanding

the increase in is attributable to continued commercial real estate loan growth primarily in the arizona and minnesota markets 
the increase in is attributable to commercial real estate loan volume generated out of the arizona  minnesota and north dakota markets 
c real estate construction loans 
the increase in is attributable to continued commercial real estate construction loan growth primarily in the arizona and minnesota markets 
the increase in is also attributable to real estate construction loans generated primarily in the arizona and minnesota markets 
d net loans 
during  we increased net loans million or percent 
we were able to fund these loans primarily due to deposit growth originating from the arizona and minnesota markets 
during  we increased our net loans million or percent as part of a strategic shift in the earning asset mix from investment securities to loans  primarily commercial real estate and construction loans 
while prospects for continued loan growth appear favorable in some of our markets  future loan growth potential is subject to volatility 
our loan portfolio is concentrated in commercial  industrial and real estate loans and we have credit concentrations in certain industries see concentrations of credit and certain geographical concentrations that relate to our primary market areas 
a downturn in certain sectors of the economy could adversely impact our borrowers 
this could  in turn  reduce the demand for loans and impact the borrowers abilities to repay their loans  while also decreasing our net interest margin 
taking a conservative posture relative to credit underwriting  we believe  is a prudent course of action  especially during slowing economic times 
we believe it is in our best interest and in the interest of our shareholders to focus attention on our quality customer relationships and to avoid growth in other than high quality credit during these uncertain times 
we cannot predict with any degree of certainty the full impact of current or future economic conditions on our ability to generate loan volume or the ultimate impact of economic conditions on our currently existing portfolio of loans 
see factors that may affect future results of operations included under item of part i 
credit policy  underwriting  approval and review procedures 
we follow a uniform credit policy that sets forth underwriting and loan administration criteria 
the board of directors the board establishes our loan policy  including lending guidelines for the various types of credit we offer based upon the recommendations of senior lending management 
credit committees may be established at either the bank or corporate level 
our loan policy is reviewed and reaffirmed by the board at least annually 
we delegate lending decision authority among various lending officers and the credit committees based on the size of the customer s credit relationship with bnc 
all loans and commitments approved in excess of  are presented to the board on a quarterly basis for summary review 
any exceptions to loan policies and guidelines  to the extent the credit relationship amount exceeds individual loan officer lending authorities  are subject to special approval by the bank s chief credit officer or the appropriate credit committee 
underwriting criteria are based upon the risks associated with each type of credit offered  the related borrowers and types of collateral 
in underwriting commercial loans  we emphasize the borrower s earnings history  capitalization and secondary sources of repayment 
in most instances  we require third party guarantees or highly liquid collateral 
our credit administration function includes an internal loan review department that reviews established levels of our loan portfolio on a continuous basis 
loan review personnel are not involved in any way in the credit underwriting or approval process 
additionally  our lenders  loan review staff  chief credit officer  loan committees and various management team members review credit related information monthly 
such information includes  but may not be limited to  delinquencies  classified and nonperforming assets  and other information  in order to evaluate credit risk within our credit portfolio and to review and establish the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
loan participations 
pursuant to our lending policy  loans may not exceed percent of the bank s legal lending limit except to the extent collateralized by us treasury securities or bank deposits and  accordingly  excluded from the bank s legal lending limit 
to accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed lending limits and internal loan restrictions relating primarily to industry concentration  the bank sells loan participations to outside participants without recourse 
loan participations sold on a nonrecourse basis to outside financial institutions were as follows as of the dates indicated loan participations sold december  in thousands from continuing operations for all periods presented 
the bank generally retains the right to service the loans as well as the right to receive a portion of the interest income on the loans 
many of the loans sold by the bank are commercial lines of credit for which balances and related payment streams cannot be reasonably estimated in order to determine the fair value of the servicing rights and or future interest income retained by the bank 
we cannot reliably predict our ability to continue to generate or sell loan participations in future periods or the terms of any such sales 
concentrations of credit 
our credit policies emphasize diversification of risk among industries  geographic areas and borrowers 
for purposes of the analysis of concentrations of credit as of december  the total outstanding loans as well as all outstanding loan commitments were included 
as of december   we identified three concentrations of loans exceeding ten percent of total loans and loan commitments outstanding 
these concentrations were in real estate  construction and lodging places  which represented  and percent  respectively  of total loans and loan commitments outstanding 
the real estate loans and commitments were extended to customers who are diversified across our market areas and who can be generally categorized as indicated below percent of total outstanding number of loans and loan customers commitments non residential and apartment building operators  developers and lessors of real property real estate holding companies total loans and commitments in the construction category were extended to customers who are located primarily in minnesota  iowa  north dakota and south dakota and who can be generally categorized as indicated below percent of total outstanding number of loans and loan customers commitments general building contractors heavy construction  excluding building 
special trade contractors total the contractors are involved in various aspects of the construction industry  including highway and street construction  water sewer drilling  plumbing  heating and air conditioning  commercial painting  electrical  concrete and excavating and foundation contractors 
loans in this category are secured  in many cases  by construction equipment 
the lodging loans and commitments were extended to customers whose properties are located throughout the united states 
loans in this category are made primarily to borrowers that have seasoned hotel portfolios and that are well diversified by location  property type and chain 
we continually monitor industry and other credit concentrations as part of our credit risk management strategies 
in cases where significant concentrations exist without sufficient diversification and other mitigating factors  we generally sell loans without recourse to outside financial institutions see loan participations 
agricultural loans 
our agricultural loan portfolio totals approximately million  or percent of total loans 
within the portfolio  loans are diversified by type and include loans to grain and or livestock producers  agricultural real estate loans  machinery and equipment and other types of loans 
the majority of our agricultural loans are extended to borrowers located in north dakota  and are diversified over several counties 
as of december   there were no agricultural loans classified as nonperforming 
loan maturities 
the following table sets forth the remaining maturities of loans in each major category of our portfolio as of december  actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications maturities of loans over year through years over years one year fixed floating fixed floating or less rate rate rate rate total in thousands commercial and industrial      real estate mortgage       real estate construction

floating rate loans include loans that would reprice prior to maturity if base rates change 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for further discussion regarding repricing of loans and other assets 
interest rate caps and floors 
from time to time we may use off balance sheet instruments  principally interest rate caps and floors  to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of on balance sheet items  including loans 
at january   we had an interest rate floor contract that qualified as a cash flow hedge of interest rate risk associated with floating rate commercial loans under sfas the floor contract was sold during see liquidity  market and credit risk  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for further discussion about accounting policies applicable to derivative financial instruments and currently outstanding instruments 
nonperforming loans and assets 
nonperforming loans consists of loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest  nonaccrual and restructured loans 
other nonperforming assets includes other real estate owned and repossessed assets 
our lending personnel are responsible for continuous monitoring of the quality of the loan portfolio 
officers are expected to maintain loan quality and deal with credit issues in a timely and proactive manner 
loan officers are responsible for regular reviews of past due loans in their respective portfolios 
the loan portfolio is also monitored regularly and examined by our loan review personnel 
loans demonstrating weaknesses are downgraded in a timely fashion and the board receives a listing of all such loans on a quarterly basis 
the following table sets forth  as of the dates indicated  the amounts of nonperforming loans and other assets  the allowance for credit losses and certain related ratios nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonperforming loans loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest  nonaccrual loans     restructured loans total nonperforming loans     other real estate owned and repossessed assets   total nonperforming assets     allowance for credit losses      ratio of total nonperforming loans to total loans 


ratio of total nonperforming assets to total assets 


ratio of allowance to nonperforming loans from continuing operations for all periods presented 
if the company s nonaccrual and restructured loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  we would have recognized additional interest income of     and  for the years ended december     and  respectively 
the interest income on nonaccrual and restructured loans actually included in our net income was     and  for the years ended december     and  respectively 
loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest include loans over days past due which we believe  based on our specific analysis of the loans  do not present doubt about the collection of interest and principal in accordance with the loan contract 
loans in this category must be well secured and in the process of collection 
our lending and management personnel monitor these loans closely 
included in this category at december  was a million loan which was past due days and still accruing interest 
see further discussion of this credit below 
nonaccrual loans include loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
accrual of interest is discontinued when we believe  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  accrued but uncollected interest income applicable to the current reporting period is reversed against interest income of the current period 
accrued but uncollected interest income applicable to previous reporting periods is charged against the allowance for credit losses 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan which may necessitate additional charges to earnings 
of the million of loans included in the nonaccrual loan category at december   million relates to two commercial customers 
one of these relationships  with total outstanding loans of  is partially guaranteed by the small business administration 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including a reduction of the interest rate or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
we had no restructured loans in our portfolio at december  other real estate owned and repossessed assets represents properties and other assets acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure 
such properties and assets are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
they are initially recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition establishing a new cost basis 
write downs to fair value at the time of acquisition are charged to the allowance for credit losses 
after foreclosure  we perform valuations periodically and the real estate or assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
write downs  revenues and expenses incurred subsequent to foreclosure are charged to operations as recognized incurred 
our ratios of total nonperforming loans to total loans and total nonperforming assets to total assets increased between december  and december  the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans decreased between december  and december  this ratio at december  was percent as compared to percent at december  this decrease and the increase in the other asset quality ratios mentioned above is primarily attributable to the million commercial credit in the category loans past due days and still accruing interest at december  subsequent to december   this loan was placed on nonaccrual  however  at december   and currently  based on the most current appraisal of the property  the loan appears to be sufficiently collateralized 
based on appraised value combined with additional guarantor support  we expect to collect the full principal balance outstanding 
on april   the company expects to take title of the property and will thereafter begin the process of selling the property 
allowing for timing required for full resolution of the credit  we feel that the amount of the allowance for credit losses allocated to this loan is sufficient given the facts and circumstances surrounding the status of the credit both at december  and at present 
without this credit in the nonperforming category  the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans at december  would have been percent 
potential problem loans 
in accordance with accounting standards  we identify loans considered impaired and the valuation allowance attributable to these loans 
impaired loans generally include loans on which we believe  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and which are analyzed for a specific reserve allowance 
we generally consider all loans risk graded substandard and doubtful as well as nonaccrual and restructured loans as impaired 
impaired loans at december   not including the past due  nonaccrual and restructured loans reported above  totaled million 
a significant portion of these loans are not in default but may have characteristics such as recent adverse operating cash flows or general risk characteristics that the loan officer feels might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments 
the ultimate resolution of these credits is subject to changes in economic conditions and other factors 
these loans are closely monitored to ensure that our position as creditor is protected to the fullest extent possible 
allowance for credit losses 
credit risk is the risk of loss from a customer default 
we have in place a process to identify and manage our credit risk 
the process includes initial credit review and approval  periodic monitoring to measure compliance with credit agreements and internal credit policies  internal credit review  monitoring changes in the risk ratings of loans and leases  identification of problem loans and leases and special procedures for collection of problem loans and leases 
the risk of loss is difficult to quantify and is subject to fluctuations in values and general economic conditions and other factors 
as discussed previously  the determination of the allowance for credit losses is a critical accounting policy  which involves estimates and our judgment on a number of factors such as net charge offs  delinquencies in the loan and lease portfolio and general and economic conditions 
we consider the allowance for credit losses of million adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of december  however  no assurance can be given that we will not  in any particular period  sustain loan and lease losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio  in light of factors then prevailing  including economic conditions and our ongoing credit review process  will not require significant increases in the allowance for credit losses 
a protracted economic slowdown and or a decline in commercial  industrial or real estate segments may have an adverse impact on the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses by increasing credit risk and the risk of potential loss 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item and critical accounting policies for further information concerning accounting policies associated with the allowance for credit losses 
we maintain our allowance for credit losses at a level considered adequate to provide for an estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses in the remaining loan and lease portfolio that have been incurred as of each balance sheet date 
the loan and lease portfolio and other credit exposures are reviewed regularly to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in determining the level of the allowance  we evaluate the allowance necessary for specific nonperforming loans and also estimate losses in other credit exposures 
the resultant three allowance components are specific reserves  reserves for homogeneous loan pools and a qualitative reserve 
these components are fully described under critical accounting policies 
continuous credit monitoring processes and the analysis of loss components is the principal method we rely upon to ensure that changes in estimated credit loss levels are reflected in our allowance for credit losses on a timely basis 
we also consider experience of peer institutions and regulatory guidance in addition to our own experience 
loans  leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the amount of the allowance for credit losses is highly dependent upon our estimates of variables affecting valuation  appraisals of collateral  evaluations of performance and status  and the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans 
such estimates  appraisals  evaluations and cash flows may be subject to frequent adjustments due to changing economic prospects of borrowers  lessees or properties 
these estimates are reviewed periodically 
actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision may be either greater than or less than actual net charge offs 
the related provision for credit losses  which is charged to income  is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance to the level determined appropriate through the application of the above processes and those discussed below in the critical accounting policies section 
at year end  our total allowance was million which equates to approximately and times the average charge offs for the last three and five years  respectively  and and times the average net charge offs for the same three and five year periods  respectively 
because historical charge offs are not necessarily indicative of future charge off levels  we also give consideration to other risk indicators when determining the appropriate allowance level 
those risk factors have been summarized above 
our charge off policy is generally consistent with regulatory standards 
our chief credit officer and vice president internal audit credit review have the primary responsibility of affirming our systematic allowance methodology  performing credit loss migration analyses and assessing the allowance components in relation to estimated and actual charge off trends 
this analysis is presented to members of management who are responsible for assessing and reporting on the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses as well as recommending revisions to our methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance as they become necessary 
concentrations of credit risk are discussed under concentrations of credit 
concentrations exist in real estate  construction and lodging places loans and commitments 
additionally  a geographic concentration of credit risk also arises because we have historically operated primarily in the upper midwest with percent of loans outstanding as of december  having been extended to customers in minnesota  north dakota and south dakota 
as of december   percent of our loans had been extended to customers in arizona 
other groups of credit risk may not constitute a significant concentration  but are analyzed based on other evident risk factors for the purpose of determining an adequate allowance level 
nonperforming and potential problem loans are defined and discussed under nonperforming loans and assets and potential problem loans 
many of these loans are specifically analyzed for purposes of determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
estimating the risk and amount of loss on any loan is subjective and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates 
although we believe that the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual credit losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  activity in the allowance for credit losses  including amounts of loans charged off  amounts of recoveries  additions to the allowance charged to operating expense  the ratio of net charge offs to average total loans  the ratio of the allowance to total loans at the end of each period and the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans analysis of allowance for credit losses for the years ended december  dollars in thousands balance of allowance for credit losses  beginning of period      charge offs commercial and industrial   real estate mortgage agricultural consumer other lease financing total charge offs    recoveries commercial and industrial real estate mortgage agricultural consumer other lease financing total recoveries net charge offs   provision for credit losses charged to operations      balance of allowance for credit losses  end of period      ratio of net charge offs to average loans

at times earning asset growth can outpace core deposit growth resulting in the use of brokered and out of market certificates of deposit and other borrowed funds

interest rate caps and floors 
from time to time we may use off balance sheet instruments  principally interest rate caps and floors  to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of on balance sheet items  including borrowings 
during may and june  we purchased  for million  interest rate cap contracts with notional amounts totaling million to mitigate interest rate risk in rising rate scenarios 
the referenced interest rate is three month libor with million of percent contracts having three year original maturities and million of percent contracts having five year original maturities

guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in company s subordinated debentures 
in july  we established a special purpose trust for the purpose of issuing million of fixed rate subordinated debentures 
the subordinated debentures qualify as tier capital up to certain limits with the balance qualifying as tier capital up to certain limits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item for a complete description of the fixed rate subordinated debentures 
in july  we established an additional special purpose trust for the purpose of issuing million of floating rate subordinated debentures 
the subordinated debentures qualify as tier capital up to certain limits with the balance qualifying as tier capital up to certain limits 
we used million of the proceeds from the subordinated debentures issued in to retire the remaining million of our percent subordinated notes due may  through the exercise of the call option on the notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item for a complete description of the floating rate subordinated debentures 
capital resources and expenditures 
we actively monitor compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  including risk based and leverage capital measures 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet  and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
note to the consolidated financial statements included under item includes a summary of the risk based and leverage capital ratios of bnccorp and its subsidiary banks as of december  and  including the capital ratios and capital amounts necessary to be considered well capitalized under prompt corrective action regulatory provisions and adequately capitalized for capital adequacy purposes 
as of each of those dates  bnccorp and the bank s exceeded capital adequacy requirements and the bank s were considered well capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions 
the capital ratios of the company and the bank s were as follows as of those dates tier total risk risk tier based based leverage as of december  ratio ratio ratio bnccorp  consolidated bnc national bank as of december  bnccorp  consolidated bnc national bank bnc national bank of arizona 
our consolidated capital ratios declined from december  to december  largely due to the intangible assets acquired in the milne scali acquisition 
intangible assets are direct deductions from tier capital 
our equity capital increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase was attributable to the issuance of million of common stock in the milne scali acquisition  the issuance of million of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and earnings of million 
additionally  as tier capital increases  a larger proportion of our subordinated debentures qualify for tier capital million at december  and million at december  
the remaining subordinated debentures qualify as tier capital 
the increase in equity capital and the resultant increase in tier capital was more than offset by the increase in intangible assets of million between december  and december  in spite of this increase in intangible assets  our consolidated and bank capital ratios at december  met all regulatory requirements 
during  the company initiated construction of an office building at north scottsdale road  scottsdale  arizona 
total cost for the building  including furniture and equipment is estimated at million 
we expect construction to be completed during and the project is being funded through cash generated from operations 
the company also plans to purchase the milne scali building at east glendale avenue  phoenix  arizona for its appraised price of million during the first quarter of the purchase will be funded through cash generated from operations 
there are no other major capital expenditures anticipated during the remainder of as we expect our current facilities  along with the construction of the facility in scottsdale  to be sufficient for operating purposes 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of business  we are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  primarily to meet the needs of our customers as well as to manage our interest rate risk 
these instruments  which we issue for purposes other than trading  carry varying degrees of credit  interest rate or liquidity risk in excess of the amount reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
we also have entered into certain guarantee arrangements that are also not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item of part ii include a summary of our off balance sheet arrangements and guarantees 
contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments 
as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item  we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts 
at december   the aggregate contractual obligations excluding bank deposits and commercial commitments were as follows in thousands payments due by period less contractual obligations than to to after year years years years total total borrowings     annual rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases      a total      amount of commitment expiration by period less other commercial commitments than to to after year years years years total commitments to lend     standby and commercial letters of credit    total     a if the milne scali building is purchased during the first quarter of as anticipated  the amounts presented in this line item would be reduced by  for the less than year column   for the to year column   for the to year column and million for the after year column 
liquidity  market and credit risk our business activities generate  in addition to other risks  significant liquidity  market and credit risks 
liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet all present and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices and represents the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will have a negative impact on our earnings or value 
our principal market risk is interest rate risk 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion about interest rate risk and its impact on net interest income 
credit risk is the possibility of loss from the failure of a customer to perform according to the terms of a contract 
we are a party to transactions involving financial instruments that create risks that may or may not be reflected on a traditional balance sheet 
these financial instruments can be subdivided into three categories cash financial instruments  generally characterized as on balance sheet items  include investments  loans  mortgage backed securities  deposits and debt obligations 
credit related financial instruments  generally characterized as off balance sheet items  include such instruments as commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit and performance and financial standby letters of credit 
derivative financial instruments  on balance sheet items as of january   include such instruments as interest rate  foreign exchange  commodity price and equity price contracts  including forwards  swaps and options 
our risk management policies are intended to monitor and limit exposure to liquidity  market and credit risks that arise from each of these financial instruments 
see loan portfolio for a discussion of our credit risk management strategies 
liquidity risk management 
liquidity risk management encompasses our ability to meet all present and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
the objectives of liquidity management policies are to maintain adequate liquid assets  liability diversification among instruments  maturities and customers and a presence in both the wholesale purchased funds market and the retail deposit market 
the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements included under item of part ii present data on cash and cash equivalents provided by and used in operating  investing and financing activities 
in addition to liquidity from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments  we utilize brokered deposits  sell securities under agreements to repurchase and borrow overnight federal funds 
the bank is a member of the fhlb  which affords it the opportunity to borrow funds in terms ranging from overnight to ten years and beyond 
borrowings from the fhlb are generally collateralized by the bank s mortgage loans and various investment securities 
see investment securities and note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of part ii 
we have also obtained funding through the issuance of subordinated notes  subordinated debentures and long term borrowings 
see borrowed funds  guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in company s subordinated debentures and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item of part ii for further information on these instruments 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a summary of our major sources and uses of funds 
this summary information is derived from the consolidated statements of cash flows included under item of part ii major sources and uses of funds for the years ended december  in thousands proceeds from sales of investment securities    proceeds from maturities of investment securities    net increase decrease in short term borrowings 
   net increase in deposits    net increase decrease in long term borrowings    proceeds from issuance of preferred stock  proceeds from issuance of subordinated debentures   proceeds from fhlb advances  purchases of investment securities    net increase in loans    repayments of fhlb advances   cash paid for acquisition of insurance subsidiary  disposition of discontinued fargo branch  our liquidity is measured by our ability to raise cash when we need it at a reasonable cost and with a minimum of loss 
given the uncertain nature of our customers demands as well as our desire to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities  we must have adequate sources of on and off balance sheet funds that can be acquired in time of need 
accordingly  in addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cash flows  liquidity is supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines with the fhlb  credit lines with correspondent banks for federal funds  wholesale and retail repurchase agreements  brokered certificates of deposit and direct non brokered national certificates of deposit through national deposit networks 
we measure our liquidity position on a monthly basis 
key factors that determine our liquidity are the reliability or stability of our deposit base  the pledged non pledged status of our investments and potential loan demand 
our liquidity management system divides the balance sheet into liquid assets  and short term liabilities that are assumed to be vulnerable to non replacement under abnormally stringent conditions 
the excess of liquid assets over short term liabilities is measured over a day planning horizon 
assumptions for short term liabilities vulnerable to non replacement under abnormally stringent conditions are based on a historical analysis of the month to month percentage changes in deposits 
the excess of liquid assets over short term liabilities and other key factors such as expected loan demand as well as access to other sources of liquidity such as lines with the fhlb  federal funds and those other supplemental sources listed above are tied together to provide a measure of our liquidity 
we have a targeted range and manage our operations such that these targets can be achieved 
we believe that our prudent management policies and guidelines will ensure adequate levels of liquidity to fund anticipated needs of on and off balance sheet items 
in addition  a contingency funding policy statement identifies actions to be taken in response to an adverse liquidity event 
as of december   we had established two revolving lines of credit with banks totaling million that were not drawn on 
the lines  if drawn upon  mature daily with interest rates that float at the federal funds rate 
at december   we also had the ability to draw additional fhlb advances of million based upon the mortgage loans and securities that were then pledged  subject to a requirement to purchase additional fhlb stock 
forward looking statements statements included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical in nature are intended to be  and are hereby identified as forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provided by section a of the securities act  as amended and section e of the exchange act  as amended 
we caution readers that these forward looking statements  including without limitation  those relating to our future business prospects  revenues  working capital  liquidity  capital needs  interest costs and income  are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements due to several important factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to risks of loans and investments  including dependence on local and regional economic conditions  competition for our customers from other providers of financial services  possible adverse effects of changes in interest rates including the effects of such changes on derivative contracts and associated accounting consequences  risks associated with our acquisition and growth strategies  and other risks which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
for a discussion of some of the additional factors that might cause such differences  see item of part i  factors that may affect future results of operations 
effects of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  banking organizations do not necessarily gain or lose due to the effects of inflation 
changes in interest rates  which are a major determinant of a financial service organization s profitability  do not necessarily correspond to changes in the prices of goods and services  however  interest rates may change in response to changes in expectations of future inflation 
an analysis of a banking organization s asset and liability structure provides the best indication of how the organization is positioned to respond to changing interest rates and maintain profitability 
the financial statements and supplementary financial data have been prepared  primarily  on a historical basis  which is mandated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
fluctuations in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements note to the consolidated financial statements included under item includes a summary of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements and their related or anticipated impact on the company 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are dependent on estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change and include the determination of the allowance for credit losses and income taxes 
the following have been identified as critical accounting policies 
allowance for credit losses 
we maintain our allowance for credit losses at a level considered adequate to provide for an estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses in the remaining loan and lease portfolio that have been incurred as of each balance sheet date 
the loan and lease portfolio and other credit exposures are reviewed regularly to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
in determining the level of the allowance  we evaluate the allowance necessary for specific nonperforming loans and also estimate losses in other credit exposures 
the resultant three allowance components are as follows specific reserves 
the amount of specific reserves is determined through a loan by loan analysis of problem loans over a minimum size that considers expected future cash flows  the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to make payments when due 
included in this group are those nonaccrual or renegotiated loans that meet the criteria as being impaired under the definition in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  sfas 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
problem loans also include those credits that have been internally classified as credits requiring management s attention due to underlying problems in the borrower s business or collateral concerns 
under sfas  any allowance on impaired loans is generally based on one of three methods 
it requires that impaired loans be measured at either the present value of expected cash flows at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral of the loan 
reserves for homogeneous loan pools 
we make a significant number of loans and leases that  due to their underlying similar characteristics  are assessed for loss as homogeneous pools 
included in the homogeneous pools are consumer loans and commercial loans under a certain size  which have been excluded from the specific reserve allocation previously discussed 
we segment the pools by type of loan or lease and using historical loss information estimate a loss reserve for each pool 
qualitative reserve 
our senior lending management also allocates reserves for special situations  which are unique to the measurement period 
these include  among other things  prevailing and anticipated economic trends  such as economic conditions in certain geographical or industry segments of the portfolio and economic trends in the retail lending sector  management s assessment of credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  delinquency trends  historical loss experience  peer group loss history and other factors 
continuous credit monitoring processes and the analysis of loss components is the principal method we rely upon to ensure that changes in estimated credit loss levels are reflected in our allowance for credit losses on a timely basis 
we also consider experience of peer institutions and regulatory guidance in addition to our own experience 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for credit losses 
such agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination 
loans  leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the amount of the allowance for credit losses is highly dependent upon our estimates of variables affecting valuation  appraisals of collateral  evaluations of performance and status  and the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans 
such estimates  appraisals  evaluations and cash flows may be subject to frequent adjustments due to changing economic prospects of borrowers  lessees or properties 
these estimates are reviewed periodically 
actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision may be either greater than or less than actual net charge offs 
the related provision for credit losses  which is charged to income  is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance to the level determined appropriate through application of the above processes 
as indicated above  we employ a systematic methodology for determining our allowance for credit losses that includes an ongoing review process and quarterly adjustment of the allowance 
our process includes periodic loan by loan review for loans that are individually evaluated for impairment as well as detailed reviews of other loans either individually or in pools 
this includes an assessment of known problem loans  potential problem loans and other loans that exhibit indicators of deterioration 
our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for credit losses that we believe is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in non performing loans and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements and borrowers sensitivity to quantifiable external factors including commodity and finished goods prices as well as acts of nature violent weather  fires  etc 
that occur in a particular period 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets and  in particular  the state of certain industries in our market areas 
size and complexity of individual credits in relation to lending officers background and experience levels  loan structure  extent and nature of waivers of existing loan policies and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in our methodology 
our methodology is  and has been  consistently applied 
however  as we add new products  increase in complexity and expand our geographical coverage  we will enhance our methodology to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan and lease portfolio 
in this regard  we may  if deemed appropriate  engage outside firms to independently assess our methodology 
on an ongoing basis we perform independent credit reviews of our loan portfolio 
we believe that our systematic methodology continues to be appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
while our methodology utilizes historical and other objective information  the establishment of the allowance for credit losses and the classification of loans is  to some extent  based on our judgment and experience 
we believe that the allowance for credit losses is adequate as of december  to cover known and inherent risks in the loan and lease portfolio 
however  future changes in circumstances  economic conditions or other factors could cause us to increase or decrease the allowance for credit losses as necessary 
income taxes 
we file consolidated federal and state income tax returns 
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
such differences can relate to differences in accounting for credit losses  depreciation timing differences  unrealized gains and losses on investment securities  deferred compensation and leases  which are treated as operating leases for tax purposes and loans for financial statement purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the determination of current and deferred income taxes is based on complex analyses of many factors including interpretation of federal and state income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities temporary differences  estimates of amounts due or owed such as the timing of reversals of temporary differences and current financial accounting standards 
actual results could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and commodity prices and equity prices and represents the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will have a negative impact on our earnings or value 
our principal market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk arises from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk can result from re pricing risk timing differences in the maturity re pricing of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts  options risk the effect of embedded options  such as loan prepayments  interest rate caps floors  and deposit withdrawals  basis risk risk resulting from unexpected changes in the spread between two or more different rates of similar maturity  and the resulting impact on the behavior of lending and funding rates  and yield curve risk risk resulting from unexpected changes in the spread between two or more rates of different maturities from the same type of instrument 
we have risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
to date we have not conducted trading activities as a means of managing interest rate risk 
our asset liability management process is utilized to manage our interest rate risk 
the measurement of interest rate risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
our interest rate risk exposure is actively managed with the objective of managing the level and potential volatility of net interest income in addition to the long term growth of equity  bearing in mind that we will always be in the business of taking on rate risk and that rate risk immunization is not entirely possible 
also  it is recognized that as exposure to interest rate risk is reduced  so too may the overall level of net interest income and equity 
in general  the assets and liabilities generated through ordinary business activities do not naturally create offsetting positions with respect to repricing or maturity characteristics 
access to the derivatives market can be an important element in maintaining our interest rate risk position within policy guidelines 
using derivative instruments  principally interest rate floors and caps  the interest rate sensitivity of specific transactions  as well as pools of assets or liabilities  is adjusted to maintain the desired interest rate risk profile 
see loan portfolio interest rate caps and floors borrowings interest rate caps and floors and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for a summary of our accounting policies pertaining to such instruments 
our primary tool in measuring and managing interest rate risk is net interest income simulation 
this exercise includes our assumptions regarding the level of interest rate or balance changes on indeterminate maturity deposit products savings  interest checking  money market and demand deposits for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior 
interest rate caps and floors are included to the extent that they are exercised in the month simulation period 
additionally  changes in prepayment behavior of the residential mortgage  cmos  and mortgage backed securities portfolios in each rate environment are captured using industry estimates of prepayment speeds for various coupon segments of the portfolio 
for purposes of this simulation  projected month end balances of the various balance sheet planning accounts are held constant at their december  levels 
cash flows from a given planning account are reinvested back into the same planning account so as to keep the month end balance constant 
the static balance sheet assumption is made so as to project the interest rate risk to net interest income embedded in the existing balance sheet 
with knowledge of the balance sheet s existing net interest income profile  more informed strategies and tactics may be developed as it relates to the structure mix of growth 
we monitor the results of net interest income simulation on a quarterly basis at regularly scheduled alco meetings 
each quarter net interest income is generally simulated for the upcoming month horizon in seven interest scenarios 
the scenarios generally modeled are parallel interest ramps of bp  bp  and bp along with a rates unchanged scenario 
the parallel movement of interest rates means all projected market interest rates move up or down by the same amount 
a ramp in interest rates means that the projected change in market interest rates occurs over the month horizon projected 
for example  in the bp scenario  the projected prime rate will decrease from its starting point at december  of percent to percent months later 
the prime rate in this example will decrease th of the overall decrease of basis points each month 
given the historically low absolute level of market interest rates as of december   the declining rate scenario analysis was limited to bp for the summary table presented below and a bp scenario was added 
the net interest income simulation result for the twelve month horizon that covers the calendar year of is shown below 
the impact of each interest rate scenario on projected net interest income is displayed before and after the impact of the million cumulative notional original year interest rate cap positions on month libor with a percent strike and the million cumulative notional original year interest rate cap positions on month libor with a percent strike 
the impact of the cap positions is calculated by determining the fair value of the contracts at the end of the month horizon using an interest rate option valuation model 
the change in fair value plus any expected cash flow in the various rate scenarios is summed to determine the total net benefit cost of the portfolio of interest rate cap contracts 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item of part ii for further discussion related to our interest rate caps and accounting policies related to these derivative instruments 
net interest income simulation amounts in thousands movement in interest rates bp unchanged bp bp bp bp projected month net interest income       dollar change from rates unchanged scenario    percentage change from rates unchanged scenario net benefit cost of cumulative million interest rate caps total net interest income impact with caps       dollar change from unchanged w caps     percentage change from unchanged w caps policy guidelines decline limited to in may and june  we purchased four interest rate cap contracts on month libor with strikes at percent each in the amount of million notional with original terms of three years for total notional of million 
we also purchased four interest rate cap contracts on month libor with strikes at percent each in the amount of million notional with original terms of five years for total notional of million 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial investments 
our rate sensitivity position over the projected twelve month horizon is asset sensitive 
this is evidenced by the projected increase in net interest income in the rising interest rate scenarios  and the decrease in net interest income in falling rate scenarios 
because one of the objectives of asset liability management is to manage net interest income over a one year planning horizon  policy guidelines are stated in terms of maximum potential reduction in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates over the twelve month period 
it is no less important  however  to give attention to the absolute dollar level of projected net interest income over the twelve month period 
for example  even though in the bp scenario  net interest income declines million  or percent  from the unchanged scenario  the level of net interest income of million is only percent below the million of net interest income recorded for the year ended december  our general policy is to limit the percentage decrease in projected net interest income to   and percent from the rates unchanged scenario for the bp  bp  bp and bp interest rate ramp scenarios  respectively 
if the projected dollars of net interest income over the next twelve month period are in excess of the board and alco established targets  then the above percentages decline do not apply 
however  if the projected percentage declines are within the above guidelines but the projected dollars of net interest income are less than the board and alco established targets  then the alco will consider tactics to increase the projected level of dollars of net interest income 
a targeted level of net interest income is established and approved by the board and alco 
this target is reevaluated and reset at each quarterly alco meeting 
the methodology used in the above net interest income simulation has changed from that we used in for the simulation presented at december   the projected net interest income in the various interest rate scenarios included planned growth assumptions applied to the various balance sheet planning accounts 
the above simulation does not include planned growth assumptions but  rather  assumes a static balance sheet so as to project the interest rate risk to net interest income embedded in the balance sheet existing at december  net interest income under the various interest rate scenarios  if presented with planned growth assumptions for applied to the various balance sheet planning accounts the methodology presented at december   would result in the following net interest income simulation amounts in thousands movement in interest rates bp unchanged bp bp bp bp projected month net interest income       dollar change from rates unchanged scenario    percentage change from rates unchanged scenario net benefit cost of cumulative million interest rate caps total net interest income impact with caps       dollar change from unchanged w caps    percentage change from unchanged w caps policy guidelines decline limited to in may and june  we purchased four interest rate cap contracts on month libor with strikes at percent each in the amount of million notional with original terms of three years for total notional of million 
we also purchased four interest rate cap contracts on month libor with strikes at percent each in the amount of million notional with original terms of five years for total notional of million 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial investments 
static gap analysis is another tool that may be used for interest rate risk measurement 
the net differences between the amount of assets  liabilities  equity and off balance sheet instruments repricing within a cumulative calendar period is typically referred to as the rate sensitivity position or gap position 
the following table sets forth our rate sensitivity position as of december  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest possible repricing date or maturity  whichever occurs first interest sensitivity gap analysis estimated maturity or repricing at december  over months months years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets interest bearing deposits with banks investment securities      frb and fhlb stock   fixed rate loans      floating rate loans    total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities interest checking and money market accounts   savings   time deposits under      time deposits  and over     borrowings      total interest bearing liabilities      interest rate gap cumulative interest rate gap at december      cumulative interest rate gap to total assets investment securities are generally reported in the timeframe representing the earliest of repricing date  call date for callable securities  estimated life or maturity date 
estimated lives of mortgage backed securities and cmos are based on published industry prepayment estimates for securities with comparable weighted average interest rates and contractual maturities 
loans are stated gross of the allowance for credit losses and are placed in the earliest timeframe in which maturity or repricing may occur 
the table assumes that all savings and interest bearing demand deposits reprice in the earliest period presented  however  we believe a significant portion of these accounts constitute a core component and are generally not rate sensitive 
our position is supported by the fact that aggressive reductions in interest rates paid on these deposits historically have not caused notable reductions in balances 
the table does not necessarily indicate the future impact of general interest rate movements on our net interest income because the repricing of certain assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other pressures 
as a result  assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
static gap analysis does not fully capture the impact of embedded options  lagged interest rate changes  administered interest rate products  or certain off balance sheet sensitivities to interest rate movements 
therefore  this tool generally cannot be used in isolation to determine the level of interest rate risk exposure in banking institutions 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  these analyses are not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of changes in market interest rates such as those indicated above on the company 
further  these analyses are based on our assets and liabilities as of december  without forward adjustments for planned growth and anticipated business activities and do not contemplate any actions we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates
