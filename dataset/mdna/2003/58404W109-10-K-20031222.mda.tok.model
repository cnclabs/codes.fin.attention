item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies general and professional liability risk 
due to unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the general and professional liability insurance markets  the cost of commercial professional and general liability insurance coverage has risen significantly in recent years 
as a result  we expect our total insurance premiums  including professional and general liability  property  business  auto  directors and officers  workers compensation and other coverages to increase approximately million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  we expect to assume a greater portion of the risk  through self insured retention and higher deductibles  under our new commercial insurance policies during fiscal than in prior fiscal years 
as we open new hospitals and diagnostic and therapeutic centers  we expect to incur additional premium costs and self insured retention costs to reflect the additional risk exposure 
lastly  we cannot be assured that our professional liability and general liability insurance  nor our recorded reserves for self insured retention  will cover all claims against us or continue to be available at reasonable costs for us to maintain adequate levels of insurance in the future 
competition in executing our business strategy  we compete primarily with other cardiovascular care providers  principally for profit and not for profit general acute care hospitals 
we also compete with other companies pursuing strategies similar to ours  and with not for profit general acute care hospitals that may elect to develop a hospital 
in some of our markets  such as sioux falls  south dakota  we may have only one competitor 
in other markets  such as phoenix  arizona  our hospitals compete for patients with the heart programs of numerous other hospitals in the same market 
in most of our markets we compete for market share of cardiovascular procedures with three to six hospitals 
some of the hospitals that compete with our hospitals are owned by governmental agencies or not for profit corporations supported by endowments and charitable contributions and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax exempt basis 
some of our competitors are larger  are more established  have greater geographic coverage  offer a wider range of services or have more capital or other resources than we do 
if our competitors are able to finance capital improvements  recruit physicians  expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities  we may experience a decline in market share 
in operating our hospitals  particularly in performing outpatient procedures  we compete with free standing diagnostic and therapeutic facilities located in the same markets

medicare is a federal program that provides hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age and over  some disabled persons and persons with end stage renal disease 
under the medicare program  we are paid for certain inpatient and outpatient services performed by our hospitals and also for services provided at our diagnostic and therapeutic facilities 
medicare payments for inpatient acute services are generally made pursuant to a prospective payment system 
under this system  hospitals are paid a prospectively determined fixed amount for each hospital discharge based on the patient s diagnosis 
specifically  each discharge is assigned to a diagnosis related group drg 
based upon the patient s condition and treatment during the relevant inpatient stay  each drg is assigned a fixed payment rate that is prospectively set using national average costs per case for treating a patient for a particular diagnosis 
such payments do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing a particular inpatient service  however  drg payments are adjusted by a predetermined geographic adjustment factor assigned to the geographic area in which the hospital is located 
while hospitals generally do not receive direct payments in addition to a drg payment  hospitals may qualify for an outlier payment when the relevant patient s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified threshold 
the drg rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year  which begins on october the update factor is determined  in part  by the projected increase in the cost of goods and services that are purchased by hospitals  referred to as the market basket index 
outlier payments  which were established by congress as part of the drg prospective payment system  are additional payments made to hospitals for treating patients who are costlier to treat than the average patient 
in general  a hospital receives outlier payments when its costs  as determined by using gross charges adjusted by the hospital s cost to charge ratio  exceed a certain threshold established annually by cms 
outlier payments are currently subject to multiple factors including but not limited to the hospital s estimated operating costs based on its historical ratio of costs to gross charges  the patient s case acuity  the cms established threshold  and  the hospital s geographic location 
cms is required by law to limit total outlier payments to between and percent of total drg payments 
cms periodically changes the threshold in order to bring expected outlier payments within the mandated limit 
an increase to the cost threshold reduces total outlier payments by reducing the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments  and reducing the dollar amount hospitals receive for those cases that qualify 
cms historically has used a hospital s most recently settled cost report to set the hospital s cost to charge ratios 
those cost reports are typically two to three years old 
additionally  if a hospital s cost to charge ratio fell below a threshold derived from the cost to charge ratios for all hospitals nationwide  then the cost to charge ratios used to calculate medicare outlier payments defaults to the statewide average  which could be considerably higher 
the statewide average was also used when settled cost reports were not available  such as with newly acquired or opened hospitals 
cms has announced that payment rates for inpatient services will rise in  resulting in higher medicare payments for most hospitals 
as part of the increase  which went into effect on october   cms expects to pay approximately billion to  acute care hospitals in  a billion increase over this year s payments 
the cms rules for fiscal also include  among other things reducing the threshold for outlier payments from  to  requiring the use of the latest of either the most recently submitted or most recently settled cost report to calculate a hospital s cost to charge ratio  eliminating the use of statewide average cost to charge ratios to determine a hospital s cost when the hospital s own cost to charge ratio falls below established parameters  and adjusting the medicare wage index for several states where we have operations 
for a discussion of the expected impact of outlier and other reimbursement changes on our net revenue in fiscal  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue sources  trends and uncertainties revenues trends and uncertainties 
outpatient services are also subject to a prospective payment system 
services provided at our freestanding diagnostic facilities are typically reimbursed on the basis of the physician fee schedule  which is revised periodically  and bases payment on various factors including resource based practice expense relative value units and geographic practice cost indices 
the medicare modernization act reduces the prospective payment update by in fiscal years   or for hospitals that fail to furnish certain quality data to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
other provisions will  among other things  increase payments to hospitals for indirect medical education  improve the treatment of new technologies under the inpatient prospective payment system  establish a commuting wage adjustment  allow hospitals to appeal their wage index classification  and temporarily increase disproportionate share hospital allotments 
many of these provisions will be clarified and implemented through the subsequent issuance of regulations 
therefore  we cannot predict with certainty how implementation of the reimbursement provisions of the medicare modernization act will impact our operations at this time 
future legislation may modify medicare reimbursement for inpatient and outpatient services provided at our hospitals or services provided at our diagnostic and therapeutic facilities  but we are not able to predict the method or amount of any such reimbursement changes or the effect that such changes will have on us 
prior to  medicare reimbursed hospitals for a portion of their actual capital costs using a formula based on the proportion of hospital days spent treating medicare beneficiaries 
in  medicare implemented a prospective payment system that established a standard amount to be paid for each discharge to cover capital costs directly related to inpatient hospital care 
the standard rate is adjusted for such factors as the hospital s particular mix of cases  its geographic location  and a disproportionate number of low income patients 
the regulations contained a year transition period that established different reimbursement methodologies for existing hospitals and new hospitals  as defined in the regulations 
a new hospital is paid of its allowable actual medicare capital related costs through the cost reporting periods ending at least two years after the hospital accepts its first patient 
for the third year through the remainder of the ten year transition period  such hospitals are paid based on either a fully prospective methodology or a hold harmless payment methodology  whichever is higher 
if a hospital qualifies as a hold harmless facility  the facility is reimbursed for the third and subsequent years a declining percentage of its historical capital cost until such time that the hold harmless cost is less than would be paid under a full federal methodology or until the transition period ends  whichever occurs first 
for discussion of a pending dispute between the company and cms regarding the capital cost reimbursement methodology applicable to four of our hospitals  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue sources and trends revenue trends and uncertainties 
medicaid 
medicaid is a state administered program for low income individuals  which is funded jointly by the federal and individual state governments 
most state medicaid payments for hospitals are made under a prospective payment system or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals 
medicaid reimbursement is often less than a hospital s cost of services 
states periodically consider significantly reducing medicaid funding  while at the same time in some cases expanding medicaid benefits 
this could adversely affect future levels of medicaid payments received by our hospitals 
we are unable to predict what impact  if any  future medicaid managed care systems might have on our operations 
the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  retroactive and prospective rate adjustments  administrative rulings  court decisions  executive orders and freezes and funding reductions  all of which may adversely affect our business 
there can be no assurance that payments for hospital services and cardiac diagnostic and other procedures under the medicare and medicaid programs will continue to be based on current methodologies or remain comparable to present levels 
in this regard  we may be subject to rate reductions as a result of federal budgetary or other legislation related to the medicare and medicaid programs 
in addition  various state medicaid programs periodically experience budgetary shortfalls  which may result in medicaid payment reductions and delays in payment to us 
utilization review 
federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to medicare and medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards and are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed 
these provisions include a requirement that a sampling of admissions of medicare and medicaid patients be reviewed by quality improvement organizations that analyze the appropriateness of medicare and medicaid patient admissions and discharges  quality of care provided  validity of drg classifications and appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay or cost 
quality improvement organizations may deny payment for services provided  assess fines and recommend to the department of health and human services that a provider not in substantial compliance with the standards of the quality improvement organization be excluded from participation in the medicare program 
most non governmental managed care organizations also require utilization review 
annual cost reports 
hospitals participating in the medicare and some medicaid programs  whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a prospective payment system  are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements 
federal and  where applicable  state regulations require submission of annual cost reports identifying medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to medicare beneficiaries and medicaid recipients 
annual cost reports required under the medicare and some medicaid programs are subject to routine governmental audits 
these audits may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs and result in a recoupment of monies paid 
finalization of these audits and determination of amounts earned under these programs often takes several years 
providers can appeal any final determination made in connection with an audit 
program adjustments 
the medicare  medicaid and other federal health care programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations  and requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions  all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payment to facilities 
the final determination of amounts earned under the programs often requires many years  because of audits by the program representatives  providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions 
management believes that the company has made adequate provision for such adjustments 
until final adjustment  however  previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required 
managed care 
the percentage of admissions and net revenue attributable at our hospitals and other facilities to managed care plans has increased as a result of pressures to control the cost of healthcare services 
we expect that the trend toward increasing percentages related to managed care plans will continue in the future 
generally  we receive lower payments from managed care plans than from traditional commercial indemnity insurers  however  as part of our business strategy  we intend to take steps to improve our managed care position 
commercial insurance 
our hospitals provide services to individuals covered by private healthcare insurance 
private insurance carriers pay our hospitals or in some cases reimburse their policyholders based upon the hospital s established charges and the coverage provided in the insurance policy 
commercial insurers are trying to limit the costs of hospital services by negotiating discounts  and including the use of prospective payment systems  which would reduce payments by commercial insurers to our hospitals 
reductions in payments for services provided by our hospitals to individuals covered by commercial insurers could adversely affect us 
we cannot predict whether or how payment by third party payors for the services provided by all hospitals and other facilities may change 
modifications in methodology or reductions in payment could adversely affect us 
regulation overview 
the healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive government regulation at the federal  state  and local levels 
under these laws and regulations  hospitals must meet requirements to be licensed under state law and be certified to participate in government programs  including the medicare and medicaid programs 
these requirements relate to matters such as the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel  operating policies and procedures  emergency medical care  maintenance of records  relationships with physicians  cost reporting and claim submission  rate setting  compliance with building codes  and environmental protection 
there are also extensive government regulations that apply to our owned and managed diagnostic facilities and the physician practices that we manage 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions  our hospitals and other facilities could lose their licenses  and their ability to participate in the medicare  medicaid and other federal and state health care programs 
in addition  government laws and regulations  or the interpretation of such laws and regulations  may change 
if that happens  we may have to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services or business structures so that our hospitals and other healthcare facilities remain qualified to participate in these programs 
we believe that our hospitals and other health care facilities are in substantial compliance with current federal  state  and local regulations and standards 
the medicare modernization act and other healthcare reform initiatives the recently enacted medicare modernization act makes significant changes to the medicare program  particularly with respect to the coverage of prescription drugs 
these modifications also include provisions affecting medicare coverage and reimbursement to general acute care hospitals  as well as other types of providers 
in addition  the medicare modernization act contains provisions that restrict reliance upon an exception to the federal physician self referral law for an month period that will have a significant impact on our development activities 
see fraud and abuse laws physician self referral law 
the healthcare industry continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that  like the medicare modernization act  would effect major changes in the healthcare system 
proposals that have been considered include changes in medicare  medicaid  and other state and federal programs  cost controls on hospitals and mandatory health insurance coverage for employees 
we cannot predict the course of future healthcare legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental healthcare programs and the effect that any legislation  interpretation  or change may have on us 
licensure and certification licensure and accreditation 
our hospitals are subject to state and local licensing requirements 
in order to verify compliance with these requirements  our hospitals are subject to periodic inspection by state and local authorities 
all of our majority owned hospitals are licensed as general acute care hospitals under applicable state law 
in addition  our hospitals are accredited by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations  a nationwide commission which establishes standards relating to physical plant  administration  quality of patient care and operation of hospital medical staffs 
certification 
in order to participate in the medicare program  each provider must meet applicable regulations of the department of health and human services relating to  among other things  the type of facility  equipment  personnel  standards of medical care and compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
all hospitals and our diagnostic and therapeutic facilities are certified to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs 
emergency medical treatment and active labor act 
the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala imposes requirements as to the care that must be provided to anyone who seeks care at facilities providing emergency medical services 
in addition  cms has issued final regulations clarifying those areas within a hospital system that must provide emergency treatment  procedures to meet on call requirements  as well as other requirements under emtala 
sanctions for failing to fulfill these requirements include exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs and civil money penalties 
in addition  the law creates private civil remedies that enable an individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a violation of the law to sue the offending hospital for damages and equitable relief 
a hospital that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another participating hospital s violation of the law also has a similar right 
although we believe that our emergency care practices are in compliance with the law and applicable regulations  we cannot assure you that governmental officials responsible for enforcing the law or others will not assert that we are in violation of these laws nor what obligations may be imposed by regulations to be issued in the future 
certificate of need laws 
in some states  the construction of new facilities  the acquisition of existing facilities or the addition of new beds or services may be subject to review by state regulatory agencies under a certificate of need program 
these laws generally require appropriate state agency determination of public need and approval prior to the addition of beds or services 
currently  we do not operate any hospitals in states that have adopted certificate of need laws 
however  these laws may limit our ability to acquire or develop new facilities in states that have such laws 
we operate diagnostic facilities in some states with certificate of need laws and we believe they are operated in compliance with applicable requirements or are exempt from such requirements 
however  we cannot assure you that government officials will agree with our interpretation of these laws 
professional licensure 
healthcare professionals who perform services at our hospitals and diagnostic and therapeutic facilities are required to be individually licensed or certified under applicable state law 
our facilities are required to have by laws relating to the credentialing process  or otherwise document appropriate medical staff credentialing 
we take steps to ensure that our employees and agents and physicians on each hospital s medical staff have all necessary licenses and certifications  and we believe that the medical staff members  as well as our employees and agents comply with all applicable state licensure laws as well as any hospital by laws applicable to credentialing activities 
however  we cannot assure you that government officials will agree with our position 
corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting 
some states have laws that prohibit unlicensed persons or business entities  including corporations  from employing physicians 
some states also have adopted laws that prohibit direct or indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between physicians and unlicensed persons or business entities 
possible sanctions for violations of these restrictions include loss of a physician s license  civil and criminal penalties  and rescission of the business arrangements 
these laws vary from state to state  are often vague  and in most states have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies 
we have attempted to structure our arrangements with healthcare providers to comply with the relevant state law 
however  we cannot assure you that governmental officials charged with responsibility for enforcing these laws will not assert that we  or the transactions in which we are involved  are in violation of these laws 
these laws may also be interpreted by the courts in a manner inconsistent with our interpretations 
fraud and abuse laws overview 
various federal and state laws govern financial and other arrangements among healthcare providers and prohibit the submission of false or fraudulent claims to the medicare  medicaid and other government healthcare programs 
penalties for violation of these laws include civil and criminal fines  imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hippa broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several civil and criminal statutes that apply to all healthcare services  whether or not they are reimbursed under a federal healthcare program 
among other things  hippa established civil monetary penalties for certain conduct  including upcoding and billing for medically unnecessary goods or services 
in addition  the federal false claims act allows an individual to bring a lawsuit on behalf of the government  in what are known as qui tam or whistleblower actions  alleging false medicare or medicaid claims or other violations of the statute 
the use of these private enforcement actions against healthcare providers has increased dramatically in the recent past  in part because the individual filing the initial complaint may be entitled to share in a portion of any settlement or judgment 
anti kickback statute 
the federal anti kickback statute prohibits providers of healthcare and others from soliciting  receiving  offering  or paying  directly or indirectly  any type of remuneration in connection with the referral of patients covered by the federal healthcare programs 
violations of the anti kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to  or imprisonment for each violation  civil fines of up to  damages of up to three times the total dollar amount involved  and exclusion from federal healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid 
as authorized by congress  the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services the oig has published safe harbor regulations that describe activities and business relationships that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti kickback statute 
however  the failure of a particular activity to comply with the safe harbor regulations does not mean that the activity violates the anti kickback statute 
there are safe harbors for various types of arrangements  including those for personal services and management contracts and others for investment interests  such as stock ownership in companies with more than million in undepreciated net tangible assets related to healthcare items and services 
this publicly traded company safe harbor contains additional criteria  including that the stock must be obtained on terms and at a price equally available to the public when trading on a registered securities exchange 
the oig is primarily responsible for enforcing the anti kickback statute and generally for identifying fraud and abuse activities affecting government programs 
in order to fulfill its duties  the oig performs audits and investigations 
in addition  the agency provides guidance to healthcare providers by issuing special fraud alerts and bulletins that identify types of activities that could violate the anti kickback statute and other fraud and abuse laws 
the oig has identified the following arrangements with physicians as potential violations of the statute payment of any incentive by the hospital each time a physician refers a patient to the hospital  use of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment for physicians  provision of free or significantly discounted billing  nursing  or other staff services  free training for a physician s office staff including management and laboratory techniques  guarantees which provide that if the physician s income fails to reach a predetermined level  the hospital will pay any portion of the remainder  low interest or interest free loans  or loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital  payment of the costs of a physician s travel and expenses for conferences  payment of services which require few  if any  substantive duties by the physician  or payment for services in excess of the fair market value of the services rendered  or purchasing goods or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value 
we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our hospitals and our other facilities 
physicians own interests in each of our hospitals and some of our cardiac catheterization laboratories 
physicians may also own our stock 
we also have contracts with physicians providing for a variety of financial arrangements  including leases  management agreements  independent contractor agreements  right of first refusal agreements  and professional service agreements 
although we believe that our arrangements with physicians have been structured to comply with the current law and available interpretations  some of our arrangements do not expressly meet the requirements for safe harbor protection 
we cannot assure you that regulatory authorities will not determine that these arrangements violate the anti kickback statute or other applicable laws 
also  most of the states in which we operate have adopted anti kickback laws  some of which apply more broadly to all payors  not just to federal health care programs 
many of these state laws do not have safe harbor regulations comparable to the federal anti kickback law and have only rarely been interpreted by the courts or other government agencies 
if our arrangements were found to violate any of these anti kickback laws we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and or possible exclusion from participating in medicare  medicaid  or other governmental healthcare programs 
physician self referral law 
section of the social security act  commonly known as the stark law  prohibits physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients for certain designated health services to entities in which they or any of their immediate family members have a direct or indirect ownership or compensation arrangement unless an exception applies 
the initial stark law applied only to referrals of clinical laboratory services 
the statute was expanded in stark ii to apply to ten additional designated health services  including inpatient and outpatient hospital services  and some radiology services 
sanctions for violating the stark law include civil monetary penalties  including up to  for each improper claim and  for any circumvention scheme  and exclusion from the medicare or medicaid programs 
there are various ownership and compensation arrangement exceptions to the self referral prohibition  including an exception for a physician s ownership in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department if the physician is authorized to perform services at the hospital 
this exception is commonly referred to as the whole hospital exception 
there is also an exception for ownership of publicly traded securities in a company that has stockholder equity exceeding million at the end of its most recent fiscal year or on average during the three previous fiscal years  as long as the physician acquired the securities on terms generally available to the public and the securities are traded on one of the major exchanges 
exceptions are also provided for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers  including employment contracts  personal service arrangements  isolated financial transactions  payments by physicians  leases  and recruitment agreements  as long as these arrangements meet certain conditions 
the medicare modernization act contains a provision that restricts reliance upon the whole hospital exception for an month period by new specialty hospitals 
in addition  the medicare modernization act prohibits an existing specialty hospital from increasing the number of physician investors existing as of november   changing or increasing its area of specialization  expanding beyond its main campus or increasing the total number of beds more than above the number of beds as of november  the medicare modernization act defines the term specialty hospital as a hospital primarily or exclusively engaged in the care and treatment of certain specified patients  including those with a cardiac condition  and directs the secretary of the department of health and human services  hhs  to issue regulations interpreting this and other provisions of the medicare modernization act 
although we do not yet know how the hhs regulations will interpret the definition of specialty hospital  it is likely that most if not all of our hospitals will fall within the final definition 
however  the limitations imposed by the medicare modernization act on the whole hospital exception do not apply to specialty hospitals that were in operation or under development on november  thus  even if our hospitals are categorized as specialty hospitals for purposes of the medicare modernization act  we do not believe the law will restrict the operations  as they currently exist  of our eleven hospitals in operation nor the opening and operation of our hospitals under development in san antonio  texas and lafayette  louisiana 
assuming each of our hospitals in operation or under development at november  is categorized as a specialty hospital  the moratorium imposed by the medicare modernization act will prohibit us from increasing the number of physician investors in any hospital  increasing by more than the number of beds in any hospital  or changing or adding to the areas of specialization of any hospital 
during the moratorium period  the medicare payment advisory commission  medpac  in consultation with the comptroller general of the united states  and the secretary of hhs are to conduct studies and develop recommendations addressing various aspects of specialty hospital operations and their relationship to full service community hospitals 
absent further congressional action  the limitations on use of the whole hospital exception and the limitations on the operation of specialty hospitals in existence or under development on november  will lapse automatically on june  the reports on specialty hospitals to be issued by medpac and hhs may contain findings  which will influence future legislative and regulatory developments 
moreover  the regulations to be promulgated by hhs that will interpret the medicare modernization act  amendments to the medicare modernization act  the stark law or other legislation including  but not limited to  an expansion or extension of the month moratorium  could require us to modify the manner in which we establish relationships with physicians and operate or develop our hospitals 
phase i of the final stark regulations was issued in january  and largely went into effect on january   except for one provision interpreting the requirement in many stark law exceptions that a physician s compensation must be set in advance 
the anticipated release date for the interpretation of this term in the phase i regulations  which would have precluded certain percentage compensation arrangements from qualifying for these exceptions  has now been extended  and  therefore  the effective date of that portion of phase i has been extended to january  cms has not yet finalized the balance of the regulations 
phase ii is expected to be published in and will address those exceptions not addressed in phase i  application of the law under the medicaid program  and issues under phase i regulations that have arisen since the issuance of the phase i regulation 
until the phase ii regulations are issued  the government has indicated that it will accept any reasonable interpretation of the statutory language 
there have been few enforcement actions taken and relatively few cases interpreting the stark law to date  although one case struck down an aspect of the phase i regulations relating to the stark law s applicability to certain types of services 
as a result  there is little indication as to how courts will interpret and apply the stark law  however  enforcement is expected to increase 
we believe we have structured our financial arrangements with physicians to comply with the statutory exceptions included in the stark law and the regulatory exceptions in phase i of the final regulations 
in particular  we believe that our physician ownership arrangements meet the whole hospital exception 
in addition  we expect to meet the exception for publicly traded securities 
the diagnostic and other facilities that we own do not furnish any designated health services as defined under the phase i regulations  and thus referrals to them are not subject to the stark law s prohibitions 
we cannot predict the final form that such regulations will take or the effect those regulations will have on us or our arrangements with physicians 
states in which we operate periodically consider adopting physician self referral laws  which may prohibit certain physician referrals or require certain disclosures 
some of these state laws would apply regardless of the source of payment for care 
these statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure and may have broader prohibitions than the stark law or more limited exceptions 
while there is little precedent for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws  we believe we have structured our financial relationships with physicians and others to comply with applicable state laws 
in addition  existing state self referral laws may be amended 
we cannot predict whether new state self referral laws or amendments to existing laws will be enacted or  once enacted  their effect on us  and we have not researched pending legislation in all the states in which our hospitals are located 
civil monetary penalties 
the social security act contains provisions imposing civil monetary penalties for various fraudulent and or abusive practices  including  among others  hospitals which knowingly make payments to a physician as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary care or services provided to medicare or medicaid beneficiaries 
in july  the oig issued a special advisory bulletin on gainsharing arrangements 
the bulletin warns that clinical joint ventures between hospitals and physicians may implicate these provisions as well as the anti kickback statute  and specifically refers to specialty hospitals  which are marketed to physicians in a position to refer patients to the hospital  and structured to take advantage of the whole hospital exception 
hospitals specializing in heart  orthopedic  and maternity care are mentioned  and the bulletin states that these hospitals may induce investor physicians to reduce services to patients through participation in profits generated by cost savings  in violation of a civil monetary penalty provision 
despite this initial broad interpretation of this civil monetary penalty law  in february  the oig issued an advisory opinion which declined to sanction a particular gainsharing arrangement under this civil monetary penalty provision  or the anti kickback statute  because of the specific circumstances and safeguards built into the arrangement 
we believe that the ownership distributions paid to physicians by our hospitals do not constitute payments made to physicians under gainsharing arrangements 
we cannot assure you  however  that government officials will agree with our interpretation of applicable law 
false claims prohibitions 
false claims are prohibited by various federal criminal and civil statutes 
in addition  the federal false claims act prohibits the submission of false or fraudulent claims to the medicare  medicaid  and other government healthcare programs 
penalties for violation of the false claims act include substantial civil and criminal fines  including treble damages  imprisonment  and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs 
in addition  the false claims act allows an individual to bring lawsuits on behalf of the government  in what are known as qui tam or whistleblower actions  alleging false medicare or medicaid claims or other violations of the statute 
a number of states  including states in which we operate  have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court 
healthcare industry investigations the federal government  private insurers  and various state enforcement agencies have increased their scrutiny of providers business arrangements and claims in an effort to identify and prosecute fraudulent and abusive practices 
there are ongoing federal and state investigations in the healthcare industry regarding multiple issues including cost reporting  billing and charge setting practices  unnecessary utilization  physician recruitment practices  physician ownership of healthcare providers  and joint ventures with hospitals 
certain of these investigations have targeted hospitals and physicians 
we have substantial medicare  medicaid  and other governmental billings  which could result in heightened scrutiny of our operations 
we continue to monitor these and all other aspects of our business and have developed a compliance program to assist us in gaining comfort that our business practices are consistent with both legal requirements and current industry standards 
however  because the federal and state fraud and abuse laws are complex and constantly evolving  we cannot assure you that government investigations will not result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices  including ours 
evolving interpretations of current  or the adoption of new  federal  or state laws or regulations could affect many of the arrangements entered into by each of our hospitals 
in public statements surrounding current investigations  governmental authorities have taken positions on a number of issues  including some for which little official interpretation previously has been available  that appear to be inconsistent with practices that have been common within the industry and that previously have not been challenged in this manner 
in some instances  government investigations that in the past have been conducted under the civil provisions of federal law may now be conducted as criminal investigations 
a number of healthcare investigations are national initiatives in which federal agencies target an entire segment of the healthcare industry 
one example involved the federal government s initiative regarding hospitals improper requests for separate payments for services rendered to a patient on an outpatient basis within three days prior to the patient s admission to the hospital  where reimbursement for such services is included as part of the reimbursement for services furnished during an inpatient stay 
the government targeted all hospital providers to ensure conformity with this reimbursement rule 
further  the federal government continues to investigate medicare overpayments to prospective payment system hospitals that incorrectly report transfers of patients to other prospective payment system hospitals as discharges 
law enforcement authorities  including the oig and the united states department of justice doj  are also increasing scrutiny of various types of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources  including so called contractual joint ventures  to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to exchange remuneration for patient care referrals and business opportunities 
investigators have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources 
recently  the oig has also begun to investigate certain hospitals with a particularly high proportion of medicare reimbursement resulting from outlier payments 
the oig s workplan has indicated its intention to review hospital privileging activities within the context of medicare conditions of participation 
it is possible that governmental or regulatory authorities could initiate investigations on these or other subjects in the future at our facilities and that such investigations could result in significant costs in responding to such investigations and penalties to us  as well as adverse publicity  declines in stock value and lawsuits brought by shareholders 
it is also possible that our executives  managers  and hospital board members  many of whom have worked at other healthcare companies that are or may become the subject of federal and state investigations and private litigation  could be included in governmental investigations or named as defendants in private litigation 
we are not aware of any material governmental investigations involving any of our facilities  our executives  managers or hospital board members 
the positions taken by authorities in any future investigations of us  our executives  managers  hospital board members or other healthcare providers  and the liabilities or penalties that may be imposed could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
clinical trials at hospitals our hospitals serve as research sites for physician clinical trials sponsored by pharmaceutical and device manufacturers and therefore may perform services on patients enrolled in those studies  including implantation of experimental devices 
only physicians who are members of the medical staff of the hospital may participate in such studies at the hospital 
all trials are approved by an institutional review board irb  which has the responsibility to review and monitor each study pursuant to applicable law and regulations 
such clinical trials are subject to numerous regulatory requirements 
the industry standard for conducting preclinical testing is embodied in the investigational new drug regulations administered by the federal food and drug administration the fda 
research conducted at institutions supported by funds from the national institutes of health must also comply with multiple project assurance agreements and with regulations and guidelines governing the conduct of clinical research that are administered by the national institutes of health  the hhs office of research integrity  and the office of human research protection 
research funded by the national institutes of health must also comply with the federal financial reporting and record keeping requirements incorporated into any grant contract awarded 
the requirements for facilities engaging in clinical trials are set forth in the code of federal regulations and published guidelines 
regulations related to good clinical practices and investigational new drugs have been mandated by the fda and have been adopted by similar regulatory authorities in other countries 
these regulations contain requirements for research  sponsors  investigators  irbs  and personnel engaged in the conduct of studies to which these regulations apply 
the regulations require that written protocols and standard operating procedures are followed during the conduct of studies and for the recording  reporting  and retention of study data and records 
cms also imposes certain requirements for billing of services provided in connection with clinical trials 
the fda and other regulatory authorities require that study results and data submitted to such authorities are based on studies conducted in accordance with the provisions related to good clinical practices and investigational new drugs 
these provisions include complying with specific regulations governing the selection of qualified investigators  obtaining specific written commitments from the investigators  disclosure of financial conflicts of interest  verifying that patient informed consent is obtained  instructing investigators to maintain records and reports  verifying drug or device safety and efficacy  and permitting appropriate governmental authorities access to data for their review 
records for clinical studies must be maintained for specific periods for inspection by the fda or other authorities during audits 
non compliance with the good clinical practices or investigational new drug requirements can result in the disqualification of data collected during the clinical trial 
it may also lead to debarment of an investigator or institution or false claims act allegations if fraud or substantial non compliance is detected  and subject a hospital to a recoupment of payments for services that are not covered by federal health care programs 
finally  non compliance could lead to revocation or non renewal of government research grants 
although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal  state  and international clinical trial laws  such laws may be modified  interpreted  or enforced differently in the future 
failure to comply with new or revised existing laws and regulations could subject us and physician investigators to loss of the right to conduct research  civil fines  criminal penalties  and other enforcement actions 
finally  new final rules have been adopted by hhs related to the responsibilities of healthcare entities to maintain the privacy of patient identifiable medical information 
see privacy and security requirements 
we have implemented new policies in an attempt to comply with these rules as they apply to clinical research  including procedures to obtain all required patient authorizations 
however  there is little or no guidance available as to how these rules will be enforced 
privacy and security requirements the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hippa  requires the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
these provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry 
on august   hhs published final regulations establishing electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically 
compliance with these regulations was required by october  for our healthcare facilities 
we believe we have complied with the electronic data transmission standards 
hippa also requires hhs to adopt standards to protect the security and privacy of health related information 
hhs released final regulations containing privacy standards on december  these privacy regulations were effective april   but compliance with these regulations was not required until april  the government issued further modifications to these regulations on august  the privacy regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health related information 
we have taken extensive measures to comply with the final privacy regulations  but since there is little guidance about how these regulations will be enforced by the government  we cannot predict whether the government will agree that our healthcare facilities are in compliance 
hhs issued regulations adopting security standards on february  and final regulations on february  these security regulations require healthcare providers to implement organizational and technical practices to protect the security of electronically maintained or transmitted health related information and will be enforced as to our healthcare facilities on and after april  at this time  we cannot predict the full impact that the security regulations will have on our operations 
violations of the administrative simplification provisions of hippa could result in civil penalties of up to  per type of violation in each calendar year and criminal penalties of up to  per violation 
in addition  our facilities will continue to remain subject to state laws that may be more restrictive than the regulations issued under hippa 
these statutes vary by state and could impose additional penalties 
compliance program the oig has issued guidelines to promote voluntarily developed and implemented compliance programs for the healthcare industry 
in february  the oig issued compliance program guidance for hospitals 
in response to the original guidelines  we adopted a code of ethics  designated compliance officers at the parent company level and individual hospitals  established a toll free compliance line  which permits anonymous reporting  implemented various compliance training programs  and developed a process for screening all employees through applicable federal and state databases 
we have established a reporting system  auditing and monitoring programs  and a disciplinary system to enforce the code of ethics  and other compliance policies 
auditing and monitoring activities include claims preparation and submission  and cover numerous issues such as coding  billing  cost reporting  and financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources 
these areas are also the focus of training programs 
our policy is to require our officers and employees to participate in compliance training programs 
the board of directors has established a compliance committee  which oversees implementation of the compliance program 
the committee consists of three outside directors  and is chaired by galen powers  a former chief counsel for the health care financing administration now known as cms  where he was responsible for providing legal advice on federal healthcare programs  particularly medicare and medicaid 
the compliance committee of the board meets at least quarterly 
the corporate compliance officer is appointed by the board  and reports to the chief executive officer and to the compliance committee of the board at least quarterly 
the corporate compliance officer is a senior vice president  and has a background in nursing and hospital administration 
each hospital has its own compliance committee that reports to its governing board 
the hospital president serves as the hospital s compliance officer 
the compliance committee of the board of directors assesses each hospital s compliance program at least annually 
the corporate compliance officer annually visits the hospitals for compliance reviews  provides an audit guide to the hospitals to evaluate compliance with our policies and procedures  and serves on the compliance committee of each hospital 
the objective of the program is to ensure that our operations at all levels are conducted in compliance with applicable federal and state laws regarding both public and private healthcare programs 
the oig has announced that it is considering revisions to its compliance guidance for hospitals  and if revisions are published  we will endeavor to modify our compliance program accordingly

the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the high and low sale prices per share of our common stock as reported by the nasdaq national market year ended september  high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year ended september  high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
the terms of our credit agreements also restrict us from paying cash dividends and making other distributions to our stockholders 
we anticipate that we will retain all earnings  if any  to develop and expand our business 
payment of dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition and operating results 
the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering were registered under the securities act of  as amended  on a registration statement on form s file no 
that was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on july  of the net proceeds of approximately million from the offering  we immediately used approximately million to increase our ownership interest in five of our heart hospitals and approximately million to pay all amounts outstanding under a million credit facility 
in october  we used million to increase our ownership interest in the heart hospital of new mexico 
in april  we used  of the net proceeds from the offering to acquire an additional three percent ownership interest in heart hospital of new mexico from its hospital investor partner 
we have also invested approximately million of the net proceeds from the public offering in our hospital development program 
we expect to use the remaining approximate million of net proceeds from the offering for development activities  working capital and other corporate purposes 
although we have identified these intended uses of the remaining proceeds  we have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from the offering 
pending those uses  we are investing the funds  along with our operating cash  in money market funds or similar short term interest bearing  investment grade securities  which are included in cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet

b we use adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda  before pre opening expenses to measure the performance of our various operating entities  to compare actual results to historical and budgeted results  and to make capital allocations 
we provide adjusted ebitda to investors to assist them in performing their analysis of our historical operating results 
further  we believe that many of our investors also invest in or have knowledge of  other healthcare companies that use adjusted ebitda as a financial performance measure 
because adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure  adjusted ebitda  as defined above  and adjusted ebitda  before pre opening expenses  as defined above  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
we provide adjusted ebitda  before pre opening expenses to investors to provide a financial measure of our operations that excludes the effect of the hospitals under development during the reporting period 
included in the tables above is a schedule that reconciles adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda  before pre opening expenses to our net income loss 
c selected operating data includes consolidated hospitals in operation as of the end of period but does not include hospitals  which were accounted for using the equity method in our consolidated financial statements 
d licensed beds represent the number of beds for which the appropriate state agency licenses a facility regardless of whether the beds are actually available for patient use 
e staffed and available beds represent the weighted average number of beds that are readily available for patient use during the period 
f admissions represent the number of patients admitted for inpatient treatment 
g adjusted admissions is a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a healthcare provider primarily focused on the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease 
we design  develop  own  and operate hospitals in partnership with physicians whom we believe have established reputations for clinical excellence 
each of our majority owned hospitals is a freestanding  licensed general acute care hospital that provides a wide range of health services  and the medical staff at each of our hospitals includes qualified physicians in various specialties 
as of september   we owned and operated ten hospitals 
these hospitals have a total of licensed beds  of which were staffed and available  and are located in eight states arizona  arkansas  california  louisiana  new mexico  ohio  south dakota and texas 
in october  we opened our eleventh hospital  which is located in the city of glendale  near milwaukee  wisconsin 
this hospital has licensed beds 
we are currently in the process of developing two hospitals  one in san antonio  texas and the other in lafayette  louisiana 
we expect these to open in january and march  respectively 
these hospitals are designed to accommodate a total of inpatient beds and will initially open with licensed beds 
our hospital division accounted for of our net revenue in fiscal in the discussions below  the results of operations for our hospital division exclude heart hospital of south dakota  as we do not consolidate this hospital s results of operations and financial position 
we own a minority interest in this hospital and do not have substantive control over it  and therefore account for our minority ownership interest as an equity investment 
in addition to our hospitals  we provide cardiovascular care services in diagnostic and therapeutic facilities in various locations and through mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories 
we also provide consulting and management services tailored primarily to cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons 
we completed our initial public offering in july by issuing  new shares of common stock  the offering generated net proceeds of approximately million 
concurrent with the public offering  we completed a series of transactions that we undertook to prepare for the public offering and to increase our ownership interest in some of our hospitals 
first  we established medcath corporation as a new holding company by issuing  shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of our predecessor holding company  medcath holdings  inc second  we completed a series of transactions in which we issued  shares of our common stock valued at the public offering price and paid approximately million cash to acquire additional ownership interests in five hospitals from our physician and other partners in each of those hospitals 
the cash paid in these transactions was financed with a portion of the net proceeds from the public offering 
hospital ownership and capital structure each of our hospitals is organized as either a limited liability company or limited partnership  with one of our wholly owned subsidiaries serving as the manager or general partner and typically holding from to of the ownership interest in the entity 
in most cases  our physician partners own the remaining ownership interests as members or limited partners 
in some instances  local market conditions have made it advantageous for us to organize a hospital with a community hospital investing as a partner in addition to physicians 
in two of our hospitals  there currently are hospital partners that hold ownership interests of and  respectively 
we include in our consolidated financial statements hospitals over which we exercise substantive control  including all hospitals in which we own more than a interest 
we use the equity method of accounting for hospitals in which we hold less than a interest and over which we do not exercise substantive control

we increased our ownership interest in tucson heart hospital from a minority to a majority ownership position in july and obtained substantive control of that hospital and began consolidating in our financial statements the hospital s results of operations and financial position from the date of acquisition 
we had previously been required to use the equity method of accounting for tucson heart hospital  which means that we included in our consolidated statement of operations only a percentage of the hospital s reported net income or loss for each reporting period as equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates 
effective october   we used approximately million of the net proceeds from the public offering to acquire an additional ownership interest in the heart hospital of new mexico from our physician and hospital partners 
the acquisition increased our ownership interest in the heart hospital of new mexico from a minority ownership position to a majority ownership position  and we obtained substantive control of the hospital 
accordingly  we began to consolidate in our financial statements the hospital s results of operations and financial position from october  the first day of our fiscal year 
before acquiring this additional interest  we were required to account for our investment in the heart hospital of new mexico using the equity method of accounting 
we acquired an additional three percent interest in this hospital in april for  in cash 
during fiscal  we were approached with two offers to buy the mcallen heart hospital  in which we owned a interest 
on march   we sold the hospital to an affiliate of universal health services  inc for approximately million 
approximately million of the sale proceeds were used to repay the hospital s long term debt  including intercompany debt 
the majority of the net proceeds from this sale were distributed to the owners of the hospital based on their respective ownership percentages 
the balance of the net proceeds will be distributed on the same basis when all contingent liabilities of the limited partnership that owned the hospital have been paid or eliminated 
hospitals under development are typically capitalized with a mix of debt and equity 
equity represents approximately to of a new hospital s anticipated development costs and pre opening expenses 
development costs include real estate acquisition  construction costs  and equipment purchases with debt accounting for the remainder of the project costs 
commercial banks or real estate investment trusts reits typically provide financing to fund a portion of a hospital s real estate acquisition  construction and related costs  while lenders affiliated with our equipment vendors typically provide debt financing for a hospital s equipment needs 
new hospital development on october   we opened harlingen medical center in harlingen  texas 
this hospital  which represents our ninth hospital in operation  focuses on cardiovascular care as well as orthopedics  neurology  obstetrics and gynecology 
on february   we opened louisiana heart hospital in st 
tammany parish just north of new orleans  louisiana 
on october   we opened the heart hospital of milwaukee 
we currently have two additional hospitals remaining under development 
one of the hospitals is located in san antonio  texas  which we expect to open in january  and the other hospital is located in lafayette  louisiana  which we expect to open in march once the entity that will own a new hospital is formed and the partners have contributed their capital  it typically takes approximately to months to develop the hospital 
as of september  the development costs for our six most recently opened hospitals  including the cost of equipment and capitalized construction period interest  have ranged from million to million depending on the size of the hospital and its location 
these costs were incurred throughout the construction period  with approximately of the costs being incurred in the last six months before opening the hospital 
in addition  we incur pre opening expenses throughout the development process  with the majority of these expenses incurred during the six to eight month period immediately prior to opening the hospital 
pre opening expenses for our six most recently opened hospitals have ranged between million and million per hospital 
approximately of these pre opening expenses were for personnel and for marketing and advertising 
the balance was distributed among several categories including staff recruitment and relocation  office and equipment rentals  travel and meals for the staff and other operating expenses such as property taxes  legal expenses  insurance and utilities 
the united states congress recently passed and president bush signed into law the medicare modernization act  which imposes an month moratorium on the development of new physician owned specialty hospitals  as such hospitals are defined in the statute  and in regulations we expect to be issued by the department of health and human services 
although the medicare modernization act will not affect our ability to open the two hospitals we have under development  it is expected to prohibit our hospital development activities as currently configured through june   the expiration date of the moratorium 
see business regulation fraud and abuse laws physician self referral laws 
management is currently conducting an in depth  strategic review process to determine what changes to the company s new hospital development strategy are appropriate in response to the medicare modernization act and other regulatory and operational developments 
see business overview 
revenue sources  trends and uncertainties revenue sources by division 
the largest percentage of our net revenue is attributable to our hospital division 
based on our continued investment in the development of hospitals  we believe our hospital division s percentage of consolidated net revenue will continue to increase in future periods 
the following table sets forth the percentage contribution of each of our consolidating divisions to consolidated net revenue in the periods indicated below 
year ended september  division hospital diagnostic services corporate and other net revenue fiscal year is provided on a pro forma basis to reflect the sale of our mcallen heart hospital and the consolidation of tucson heart hospital resulting from the transactions discussed above 
sources of revenue by payor 
we receive payments for our services rendered to patients from the medicare and medicaid programs  commercial insurers  health maintenance organizations  and our patients directly 
generally  our net revenue is determined by a number of factors  including the payor mix  the number and nature of procedures performed and the rate of payment for the procedures 
since cardiovascular disease disproportionately affects older people  the proportion of net revenue we derive from the medicare program is higher than that of most general acute care hospitals 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our hospital division s net revenue we earned by category of payor in each of our last three fiscal years 
hospital division year ended september  payor medicare and medicaid commercial and other total hospital division net revenue payments we receive from the medicare and medicaid programs for services rendered to patients also comprise a significant part of our total net revenue 
the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net revenue we earned by category of payor in our last three fiscal years 
consolidated year ended september  payor medicare and medicaid commercial and other total consolidated net revenue we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies  such as fee for service charges and rates based on diagnosis related groups 
we limit the number of per diem contracts we accept from managed care organizations because we believe these contracts do not reimburse us sufficiently for the efficiencies that we achieve in our hospitals 
we do not accept capitation contracts from any payors 
revenue trends and uncertainties 
we expect the net revenue that we receive from the medicare program as a percentage of total consolidated net revenue to remain significant in future periods because the percentage of our total consolidated net revenue generated by our hospital division will continue to increase as we open new hospitals 
the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  retroactive and prospective rate adjustments  administrative rulings  court decisions  executive orders and freezes and funding reductions  all of which may significantly affect our business 
in addition  reimbursement is generally subject to adjustment following audit by third party payors  including the fiscal intermediaries who administer the medicare program for the center for medicare and medicaid services cms 
final determination of amounts due providers under the medicare program often takes several years because of such audits  as well as resulting provider appeals and the application of technical reimbursement provisions 
we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might result from these programs  however  due to the complexity of laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  the manner in which they are interpreted and the other complexities involved in estimating our net revenue  there is a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
see item business reimbursement and regulation 
we expect that the changes in the outlier formula will decrease our outlier payments in fiscal by approximately million to million 
we also expect that the increase in payment rates and revised wage indexes in fiscal will increase our net revenue by approximately million to million 
however  because the regulations are subject to change  and due to the complexity of laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  the manner in which they are interpreted and the other complexities involved in estimating the impact of these announced changes on our net revenue  there is a reasonable possibility that our estimates will change by a material amount in the near future 
medicare reimburses hospitals for capital related costs using one of two alternative methodologies based upon how the hospital is categorized under cms regulations 
we sought and received a written determination from one of our medicare fiscal intermediaries on october  regarding the capital cost reimbursement methodology applicable to four of our hospitals 
the fiscal intermediary s october written determination confirmed the methodology being applied by those hospitals 
we recorded and collected net revenue for services rendered by these hospitals at the estimated net realizable amount determined in accordance with the capital cost reimbursement methodology provided by the fiscal intermediary in its october determination 
on august   we were notified by the fiscal intermediary that it had been directed by cms to change  on a retroactive and prospective basis  the methodology confirmed by the fiscal intermediary in its october determination 
we believe that the position taken by the fiscal intermediary in october was based upon a correct interpretation of applicable cms regulations and intend to vigorously pursue our administrative  judicial and other remedies to reverse any final determination contrary to that position 
if cms does not revert to the determination made by the fiscal intermediary in october  or maintains that it is appropriate to apply the change in methodology on a retroactive basis  we would be required to repay the medicare program for the resulting reduction in previously reimbursed capital costs 
if required  such repayments would be recorded as a change in accounting estimate and could result in a material reduction in our net revenue in the period recorded 
such change in reimbursement methodology could also have a material adverse impact on net revenue in future periods 
in regards to the retroactive component  the fiscal intermediary has not advised us of the amount of reimbursement associated with the change in methodology 
in addition to beginning the administrative process to challenge the august  determination  we have been  and remain  actively involved in negotiations with cms to resolve this matter 
management believes based on the advice of counsel and the status of the negotiations with cms  that we will not be required to repay the retroactive amount of reimbursement associated with the change in methodology 
accordingly  we have not recognized a contingent liability for the retroactive reimbursement in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in regards to the prospective component  the fiscal intermediary began making payments for capital cost reimbursement under the new methodology for all claims submitted after august  the impact of this change for fiscal was a million reduction in our net revenue 
in addition  we estimate the impact of this change in reimbursement will be approximately million in fiscal the impact will diminish rapidly in future years  based on how reimbursement is calculated  and we estimate that the cumulative negative impact for fiscal years through will be from million to million 
while this prospective treatment is subject to our administrative challenges and negotiations with cms  we have not recognized a contingent receivable for the decrease in the prospective reimbursement from august  through september  this accounting treatment is in accordance with sfas no 
 which does not permit contingent gains to be recorded until such amounts are realized 
if we ultimately recover all  or some portion  of the decrease in prospective reimbursement  the amount will be recognized in the future period in which the settlement occurs 
during fiscal and  we owned and managed gaston cardiology services  llc  which generated net revenue of million and million  respectively 
in november  our partner in this venture exercised an option to terminate the arrangement 
consequently  our net revenue and operating results in fiscal will reflect the termination of this venture 
critical accounting policies general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and make changes as experience develops or new information becomes known 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we define critical accounting policies as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine and have the potential to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by governmental programs such as medicare and medicaid and other third party payors such as commercial insurers  health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations are generally less than our established billing rates 
payment arrangements with third party payors may include prospectively determined rates per discharge or per visit  a discount from established charges  per diem payments  reimbursed costs subject to limits and or other similar contractual arrangements 
as a result  net revenue for services rendered to patients is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts as services are rendered 
we account for the difference between the estimated realizable rates under the reimbursement program and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which are accrued on an estimated basis in the period that the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as adjustments become known and final settlements are determined 
estimates of contractual adjustments are made on a payor specific basis and based on the best information available regarding our interpretation of the applicable laws  regulations and contract terms 
we continually review the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to the laws and regulations and any changes in the contractual terms of our programs 
final settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties  which can take several years to determine 
we record adjustments to the estimated billings as contractual adjustments in the periods that such adjustments become known or as the service years are no longer subject to audit  review or investigation 
due to the complexity of laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  the manner in which they are interpreted  and the other complexities involved in estimating our net revenue  there is a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
we also provide care to patients who meet certain criteria under our charity care policy without charge or at amounts less than our established rates 
because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  they are not reported as net revenue 
our managed diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories operate under various contracts where management fee revenue is recognized under fixed rate and percentage of income arrangements as services are rendered 
in addition  certain diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories recognize additional revenue under cost reimbursement and equipment lease arrangements 
net revenue from our owned diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts due from patients  third party payors  and others as services are rendered  including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third party payors 
our consulting and management operations  which are included in our corporate and other division  operate under various contracts where management fee revenue is recognized under various percentage of income and cost reimbursement arrangements and consulting and other revenue under service contractual arrangements as services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients in our hospital division 
the remainder of our accounts receivable principally consist of amounts due from billings to hospitals for various cardiovascular care services performed in our diagnostics division and amounts due under consulting and management contracts in our cardiology consulting and management operations 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
we estimate this allowance based on such factors as payor mix  aging and the historical collection experience and write offs of our respective hospitals and other business units 
within our hospital division  which comprised of our accounts receivable at september  and of our net revenue for fiscal  we rely on periodic detailed reviews of historical collections and write offs at each of our hospitals to estimate this allowance 
adverse changes in business office operations  payor mix  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care reimbursement could affect our collection of accounts receivable 
general and professional liability risk 
on june   our three year combined insurance policy that provided medical malpractice claims coverage on a claims made  first dollar basis  expired and we entered into a new partially self insured coverage program 
at that time  we purchased a tail insurance policy to provide first dollar coverage for claims incurred prior to june   but not reported as of that date under the expired claims made policy 
we recognized the full cost of the tail insurance policy as an operating expense in the third quarter of fiscal as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
from june  through may   we were partially self insured under a claims made policy providing coverage for claim amounts in excess of million of retained liability per claim 
effective june   we entered into a new one year claims made policy providing coverage for claim amounts in excess of million of retained liability per claim  subject to million of retained liability per claim for the first two claims reported during the policy year at one of our hospitals 
because of our self insured retention levels  we are required to recognize an estimated expense liability for the amount of our retained liability applicable to each malpractice claim 
as of september   the total estimated liability for our self insured retention on medical malpractice claims  including an estimated amount for incurred but not reported claims  was approximately million  which is included in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we maintain this reserve based on actuarial estimates prepared by an independent third party  who bases the estimates on our historical experience with claims and assumptions about future events 
in addition to reserves for medical malpractice  we also maintain reserves for our self insured healthcare and dental coverage provided to our employees 
as of september   our total estimated reserve for self insured liabilities on employee health and dental claims was million  which is included in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we maintain this reserve based on our historical experience with claims 
we also maintain commercial stop loss coverage for our health and dental insurance program of  per plan participant 
we continually review our estimates for self insured liabilities and record adjustments as experience develops or new information becomes known 
the changes to the estimated liabilities are included in current operating results 
due to the considerable variability that is inherent in such estimates  including such factors as changes in medical costs and changes in actual experience  there is a reasonable possibility that the recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
also  there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates 
we expect both the premium costs and the self insured retention under our various general and professional liability risk programs will increase our other operating expenses during the next twelve months 
as we open new hospitals and diagnostic and therapeutic centers  we also expect to incur additional premium costs and self insured retention costs to reflect the additional risk exposure 
impairment of long lived assets 
effective october   the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  which superceded sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we assess the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill and other intangible assets  for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset  or related group of assets  may not be recoverable 
we continually consider internal and external factors such as hospital and physician contract changes  local market developments  changes in third party reimbursement methodologies  national health care trends  and other publicly available information 
measurement of the amount of the impairment  if any  may be based on quoted market prices  if available  or an estimate based on valuation techniques available in the circumstances  including discounted cash flows using our cost of capital 
the estimates of these future cash flows are based on assumptions and projections that we believe to be reasonable and supportable 
as considerable judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows and fair values  there is a reasonable possibility that actual results may vary significantly from such estimates 
no impairment charges were recognized for our fiscal years and an impairment charge of  was recognized during our fiscal year goodwill 
goodwill arising from business combinations completed after june  is accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
also effective october   the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted the remaining provisions of sfas no 
accordingly  we do not amortize goodwill  but rather we subject our goodwill to an annual test at september for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we will also test goodwill of our reporting units between annual tests if an event occurs  or circumstances change  that indicate an impairment may exist  in accordance with sfas no 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units principally using discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings valuation methods 
we typically also engage independent third party valuation experts to assist in calculating the fair value of our reporting units  and the fair values of our reporting units tangible and identifiable intangible assets to the extent necessary to determine the amount of any impairment charges 
during fiscal year  we subjected our goodwill to both an interim test in march and an annual test at september  in march  we determined that the decline in our market capitalization  as measured by our common stock price  since september  represented an event requiring an interim goodwill impairment test to be performed 
the results of this test concluded no goodwill impairment existed at march in september  we performed another goodwill impairment test 
this testing date was consistent with both our designated annual testing date under sfas no 
and a new triggering event  which was the preparation of our fiscal financial budget during the fourth quarter of fiscal the results of this test concluded our goodwill was impaired  and based on the hypothetical purchase price methodology required under sfas no 
 we determined the amount of the goodwill impairment to be approximately million at september  the million impairment charge consisted of million related to our hospital division reporting unit  which reduced its remaining goodwill to million at september   and million related to our diagnostics division reporting unit  which reduced its remaining goodwill to at september  earnings allocated to minority interests 
earnings allocated to minority interests represent the allocation of profits and losses to minority owners in our consolidated subsidiaries 
with respect to our consolidated hospitals  each hospital s profits and losses are generally allocated for accounting purposes to us and our minority partners on a pro rata basis in accordance with the respective ownership percentages 
however  if the cumulative losses of a hospital exceed its initial capitalization and committed capital obligations of our partners  then we are required  due to the respective at risk capital positions  by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to recognize a disproportionate share of the hospital s losses that otherwise would be allocated to all owners on a pro rata basis 
in such cases  we will then recognize a disproportionate share of the hospital s future profits to the extent we have previously recognized a disproportionate share of the hospital s losses 
the determination of at risk capital position is based on the specific terms of each hospital s operating agreement  including each partner s contributed capital  obligation to provide working capital loans  to contribute additional capital  or to guarantee the outstanding obligations of the hospital 
during each of our fiscal years  and  our reported earnings allocated to minority interests of million  million  million  respectively  would have been  million and million had we not recognized disproportionate allocations as described above 
therefore  for the fiscal years  and  our reported income loss before income taxes of million  million and million  respectively  would have been million  million and million 
we expect our earnings allocated to minority interests to fluctuate in future periods as we either recognize disproportionate losses and or recoveries thereof through disproportionate profits of our hospitals 
as of september   we had remaining cumulative disproportionate loss allocations of approximately million that we may recover in future periods  or be required to recognize additional disproportionate losses  depending on the results of operations of each of our hospitals 
we could also be required to recognize disproportionate losses at our other hospitals not currently in disproportionate allocation depending on their results of operations in future periods 
income taxes 
income taxes are provided for under the liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or their future deductibility is uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal  our effective income tax rate was  which was below our statutory rate of due primarily to non deductibility for income tax purposes of the million impairment of goodwill 
in future periods we expect our effective income tax rate  and related income tax expense or benefit  to increase and more closely approximate our statutory rate 
in addition  the amount of current income tax liability we will have in future periods may be offset by million and million of gross federal and state  respectively  net operating loss carryforwards from prior periods we have available as of september  results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  information expressed as a percentage of net revenue 
this information has been derived from the audited consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this report 
year ended september  net revenue operating expenses personnel expense medical supplies expense bad debt expense other operating expenses pre opening expenses depreciation amortization loss gain on disposal of property  equipment and other assets loss on debt refinancing gain on sale of hospital impairment of goodwill and long lived assets loss income from operations other income expenses interest expense interest income other income  net equity loss in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates loss income before minority interest and income taxes minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries loss income before income taxes income tax expense net loss income fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenue increased million  or  to million for our fiscal year ended september  from million for our fiscal year ended september  the million increase in net revenue resulted from a million increase generated by our hospital division  offset in part by an million decrease in our diagnostics division and a million decrease in our corporate and other division  which includes our cardiology consulting and management operations 
the million increase in our hospital division s net revenue was primarily attributable to the opening of harlingen medical center on october  and the opening of louisiana heart hospital on february  harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital generated million of the million increase in our hospital division s net revenue during fiscal the million decrease in our diagnostic services division was primarily the result of the million of net revenue arising from management fees that we recognized in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of the favorable settlement of the sun city cardiac center billing dispute 
excluding the effect of this favorable settlement  our diagnostics division generated a million increase in net revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal this million increase was primarily due to the increase in net revenue generated by new diagnostic and therapeutic facilities opened since fiscal  offset in part by a decrease in net revenue in our mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories and in one of our hospital based cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic facilities due to a decline in the number of procedures performed during fiscal compared to fiscal the million decrease in our corporate and other division s net revenue was primarily due to a decrease in our cardiology consulting and management operations and included a million decrease due to the expiration of a management contract during fiscal and a million decrease due to the restructuring of one of our two physician management contracts in the third quarter of fiscal the restructuring of the physician management contracts during the third quarter of fiscal reduced management fee revenue  but more significantly eliminated the cost reimbursement arrangement whereby we were previously reimbursed for costs on a pass through basis 
the change of the reimbursement terms of this contract reduced both net revenue and certain of our operating expenses by corresponding amounts  and therefore had no impact on our consolidated loss from operations or our consolidated net loss for fiscal on a same facility basis in our hospital division  net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for this million increase includes the impact of an additional million of net revenue that was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal by one of our hospitals as a result of a favorable settlement of a billing dispute with a managed care provider 
excluding this million of additional net revenue from the third quarter of fiscal  our hospital division s net revenue increased million 
this increase in net revenue was due to an increase in the number of procedures performed and an increase in billing rates in our same facility hospitals during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase in net revenue was achieved after the impact of a million reduction in our net revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting from an unanticipated change by one of our medicare fiscal intermediaries in their interpretation of how the capital cost reimbursement methodology should be applied at four of our hospitals see revenue sources  trends and uncertainties revenue trends and uncertainties 
on a same facility basis in our hospital division  admissions decreased and adjusted admissions declined 
these operating measures reflect the impact of events at two of our hospitals 
the first was lower patient volume at bakersfield heart hospital during the first six months of fiscal due to the transition associated with the reopening of the hospital s emergency department during the second quarter of fiscal the second was lower inpatient volumes and net revenue in tucson heart hospital during fiscal due to i an increase in emergency room capacity in the market by competitors  ii an increase in the number of patients using the hospital s outpatient services  iii an apparent reduction in the number of winter visitors in the market for healthcare  which we believe is related to the poor economy  and iv a mild flu season in the market 
on a same facility basis excluding the impact of these two hospitals  admissions increased and adjusted admissions increased for fiscal compared to also on a same facility basis  inpatient catheterization procedures increased and inpatient surgical procedures increased for fiscal compared to fiscal average length of stay in our same facility hospitals decreased to days for fiscal compared to days for fiscal a significant portion of our net revenue is derived from federal and state governmental healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid  which represented and of our net revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
see revenue sources  trends and uncertainties revenue trends and uncertainties 
personnel expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the million increase in personnel expense was primarily due to a million increase generated by our hospital division  which included a million increase attributable to the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital during fiscal the remaining million increase in our same facility hospitals was primarily due to higher wage rates and benefit costs  offset in part by a decrease in the use of contract nurses in our same facility hospitals during fiscal compared to fiscal and a decrease in staffing at one of our hospitals related to the decline in admissions and procedures performed in that hospital  primarily related to the closing of the emergency department as previously discussed  during the first six months of fiscal the increase in the hospital division s personnel expense was offset in part by a decrease in our corporate and other division s personnel expense due to the change in the physician management contract in our cardiology consulting and management operations whereby certain reimbursable costs are no longer being passed through our operations  as previously discussed 
as a percentage of net revenue  personnel expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital from fiscal and excluding the million of net revenue resulting from the sun city settlement and the million of net revenue resulting from the settlement of a billing dispute with a managed care provider from fiscal  personnel expense represented of net revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal medical supplies expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal of this million increase in medical supplies expense  our hospital division generated a million increase that included an increase of million attributable to the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital during fiscal the remaining increase of million in our same facility hospitals was primarily due to a increase in surgical procedures and a increase in catheterization procedures performed during fiscal compared to fiscal combined with the increase in costs resulting from the introduction of drug eluting stents in april the increase in surgical procedures during included a significant increase in procedures that use higher cost medical devices and supplies  such as automatic interior cardiac devices aicd and pacemaker procedures 
surgical procedures typically involve higher cost medical devices and supplies than catheterization procedures  and certain surgical procedures such as aicds and pacemaker procedures involve high cost devices  which makes our medical supplies expense sensitive to changes in case mix of procedures at each of our individual hospitals 
in addition  the introduction of drug eluting stents in april contributed to higher supply cost during the last five months of fiscal the remaining million increase in medical supplies expense was incurred by our diagnostics division and was primarily due to the net revenue growth in its operations  a change in procedure mix in one of our diagnostic centers  and the increased costs associated with drug eluting stents during fiscal under the agreements with our hospital customers where we operate cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic centers  we are typically able to pass through most of the increased costs associated with drug eluting stents 
as a percentage of net revenue  medical supplies expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital from fiscal and excluding the million of net revenue resulting from the sun city settlement and the million of net revenue resulting from the settlement of a billing dispute with a managed care provider from fiscal  medical supplies expense represented of net revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal we expect our same facilities medical supplies expense to continue to increase as new technologies are introduced into the cardiovascular care market and as we experience increased utilization of aicd and pacemaker procedures that use high cost devices 
the amount of increase in our medical supplies expense  and the relationship to net revenue  in future periods will depend on many factors such as the introduction  availability  cost and utilization of the specific technology by physicians in providing patient care  as well as any changes in reimbursement amounts we may receive from medicare and other payors 
also as previously discussed  we expect our medical supplies expense in future periods will remain sensitive to changes in case mix of procedures at our hospitals 
bad debt expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase was primarily due to the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital during fiscal  offset in part by a decrease in bad debt expense of our same facility hospitals due to the continued improvement in the receivables collection procedures and the decline in our hospital division s days of net revenue in accounts receivable 
our same facility hospitals days of net revenue in accounts receivable  based on fiscal year net revenue  was days as of september  compared to days as of september  we primarily attribute the decline in days of net revenue in accounts receivable and the decline in bad debt expense in our same facility hospitals to the receivables collection procedures and other processes we implemented in our business offices during fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  bad debt expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital from fiscal and excluding the million of net revenue resulting from the sun city settlement and the million of net revenue resulting from the settlement of a billing dispute with a managed care provider from fiscal  bad debt expense represented of net revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal we expect our bad debt expenses to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in operating activity related to the opening of the hospitals we currently have under development 
other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal other operating expenses include primarily maintenance  rent  property taxes  insurance  utilities  advertising  travel  professional fees  contract services and support services provided to operating divisions by our corporate office 
of the million increase in other operating expenses  our hospital division generated a million increase and our diagnostics division generated a  increase  which were partially offset by a million decrease in our corporate and other division 
the million increase in our hospital division s other operating expenses included a million increase attributable to the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital during fiscal the remaining million increase in our hospital division s other operating expenses was primarily due to an overall increase in our insurance costs  primarily medical malpractice insurance costs  including both premiums and self insured retention  of our same facility hospitals during fiscal compared to fiscal  see critical accounting policies general and professional liability risk and item business insurance and an increase in the maintenance expense at some of our same facility hospitals 
the  increase in our diagnostic services division s other operating expenses was primarily due to the increase in insurance costs and net revenue growth in the division s operations  as previously discussed  offset in part by a decrease in legal expenses during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in the diagnostics division s legal expenses was attributable to an unusually high amount of legal expenses incurred during fiscal relating to the sun city settlement 
the million decrease in other operating expenses of our corporate and other division was primarily due to the expiration of a management contract during fiscal and the change in a physician management contract in the third quarter of fiscal in our cardiology consulting and management operations  as previously discussed 
these decreases in other operating expenses were offset in part by increases resulting from severance costs recognized for certain of our previous executive officers  net of bonuses not paid  and costs associated with an offering of debt securities that we elected to delay during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  other operating expenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital from fiscal and excluding the million of net revenue and the million of legal expense resulting from the sun city settlement and the million of net revenue resulting from the settlement of a billing dispute with a managed care provider from fiscal  other operating expense represented of net revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal pre opening expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal pre opening expenses represent expenses specifically related to projects under development  primarily new hospitals 
as of september   we had three hospitals under development  including the heart hospital of milwaukee  texsan heart hospital and heart hospital of lafayette 
we opened the heart hospital of milwaukee on october  and expect to open texsan heart hospital in january and heart hospital of lafayette in march we expect pre opening expenses for these three hospitals will range from approximately million to million per hospital 
historically  based on our six most recently developed majority owned hospitals  approximately of our pre opening expenses for a new hospital have been for personnel and for marketing and advertising 
the remaining costs have been distributed among several categories including staff recruitment  office and equipment rentals  travel and other operating expenses such as legal expense and utilities 
while we incur pre opening expenses throughout the development process  we expect to incur the majority of these expenses during the six to eight month period immediately prior to the opening of the hospital 
as of september   we had five hospitals under development 
we expect pre opening expenses to decrease for fiscal compared to fiscal as development activity related to our hospitals remaining under development will be completed during the first six months of fiscal in addition  the united states congress recently passed and president bush signed into law the medicare modernization act  which imposes an month moratorium on the development of new physician owned specialty hospitals  as such hospitals are defined in the statute and interpretative regulations we expect to be issued by the department of health and human services 
although the medicare modernization act will not affect our ability to open our two hospitals currently under development  it is expected to prohibit our hospital development activities as currently configured through june   the expiration date of the moratorium 
see business regulation fraud and abuse laws physician self referral laws 
depreciation increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase in depreciation primarily occurred in our hospital division and was due to the depreciation of assets placed in service upon the opening of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital  offset in part by a decrease related to equipment that became fully depreciated since fiscal at some of our older hospitals 
we expect depreciation expense to be higher for fiscal compared to fiscal due to the opening of our two new hospitals during fiscal and the openings of three additional new hospitals during the first six months of fiscal amortization decreased approximately million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the write off of other intangible assets in connection with the settlement and expiration of a management contract during fiscal and a change in the estimated useful life of certain intangible assets related to the change in the physician management contract in our cardiology consulting and management operations during the third quarter of fiscal the decrease was also partially due to other intangible assets that became fully amortized during the fourth quarter of fiscal in our corporate and other division 
during fiscal  we recognized a million gain on the settlement of a management contract in our cardiology consulting and management operations that occurred in december this gain is included in gain on sale of property  equipment and other assets in our consolidated financial statements 
in september  we performed a goodwill impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires that we do not amortize goodwill  but rather subject our goodwill to an impairment test on an annual basis at september under our accounting policies  and between annual dates if an event occurs  or circumstances change  that indicate an impairment may exist 
the results of this test concluded our goodwill was impaired  and based on the hypothetical purchase price methodology required under sfas no 
 we determined the amount of the goodwill impairment to be approximately million at september  after recognizing this impairment  we have remaining goodwill of million related to our hospital division  which will continue to be subject to periodic impairment tests  and could result in material charges if such amounts are determined to be impaired in future periods 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase in interest expense was primarily due to the operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital  offset in part by a decrease in interest expense of our same facility hospitals resulting from a decrease in outstanding debt through scheduled principal payment reductions and lower interest rates on our variable rate debt during fiscal compared to in addition  we capitalized approximately million and million of interest expense as part of the capitalized construction costs of our hospitals under development  which was not included in interest expense recognized for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
interest income decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  which was primarily due to the decline in interest rates and balance of our variable rate short term investments  which are included in cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets 
we expect the total amount of our outstanding indebtedness will increase in future periods as a result of the debt we will incur to finance the development of our hospitals currently under development and any others that we may begin to develop in future periods 
accordingly  we expect our interest expense to increase in future periods consistent with the increase in our indebtedness and changes in market interest rates 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  which was primarily due to improved operating results from our unconsolidated affiliate hospital 
we have only one hospital in which we hold less than a equity interest and over which we do not have substantive control  such that we were required to account for as an equity investment during fiscal and we also continue to hold a small number of additional equity investments in our diagnostic services division  our corporate and other division  and in one of our hospitals 
earnings allocated to minority interests decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal excluding the effect of the million allocated to minority interests during fiscal resulting from the sun city settlement  earnings allocated to minority interests decreased million for fiscal compared to fiscal this million decrease was primarily due to the losses allocated to minority interest in harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital  losses allocated in our hospitals under development resulting from the increase in pre opening expenses at those hospitals  and a decline in the operating results of one of our same facility hospitals during fiscal compared to fiscal these decreases to minority interest were offset in part by an increase in minority interest in the earnings of one of our hospitals in which we recognized a disproportionate share of the profits during fiscal compared to our pro rata share during fiscal during fiscal  our reported earnings allocated to minority interests of million would have been an earnings allocation of  had we not recognized disproportionate allocations at our hospitals 
therefore  our reported loss before income taxes of million would have been a loss of million 
see additional discussion of disproportionate allocations under the caption above critical accounting policies earnings allocated to minority interests 
income tax expense decreased to  for fiscal from million for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal for fiscal  our reported loss before income taxes of million included a million impairment of goodwill  which is non deductible on a permanent basis for tax purposes 
accordingly  our loss before income taxes that was subject to current and deferred taxes was only million  and we recognized income tax expense of  which was comprised of  of current income tax expense offset by  of deferred income tax benefit during fiscal because we continue to have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards available from prior periods to offset our current tax liability  we have no material current cash income tax liability and the majority of our income tax expense is deferred 
in future periods we expect our effective income tax rate  and related income tax expense or benefit  to increase to more closely approximate our statutory rate 
in addition  the amount of current income tax liability we will have in future periods may be offset by million and million of gross federal and state  respectively  net operating loss carryforwards from prior periods we have available as of september  fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenue increased million  or  to million in our fiscal year ended september  from million in our fiscal year ended september  of the million increase in net revenue  our hospital division generated a million increase and our diagnostics division generated an million increase 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in our corporate and other division  which includes our cardiology consulting and management operations 
the million increase in our hospital division s net revenue includes the effect of four events 
in march  we sold our mcallen heart hospital  in july  we began consolidating the financial results of our tucson heart hospital  and on october   we began consolidating the financial results of our heart hospital of new mexico 
these three events in our hospital division combined for a net increase of million in net revenue during fiscal from fiscal lastly  in june  one of our hospitals reached a favorable settlement of a billing dispute with a managed care provider  which resulted in that hospital recognizing an additional million of net revenue for fiscal the remaining million increase in our hospital division s net revenue was primarily attributable to a increase in adjusted admissions and a increase in revenue per adjusted admission 
the million increase in our diagnostics division includes the effect of two events 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we received an arbitration award involving a billing dispute with our hospital joint venture partner in one of our diagnostic and therapeutic centers  which increased net revenue for fiscal by million 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recognized a million increase in net revenue from management fees resulting from the favorable settlement of a billing dispute between one of our managed diagnostic centers  sun city cardiac center  and sun health corporation  which owns and operates the hospital where the center is located 
under the terms of the settlement  sun city cardiac center was awarded total proceeds of million relating to service fees  attorney fees and interest costs owed during the period of the contractual dispute 
we own a interest in sun city cardiac associates  which manages sun city cardiac center and receives management fees for performing such services 
excluding the effect of these two events  our diagnostic services division generated a million increase in net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal this million increase was primarily due to rate increases over the prior year  including those resulting from a new services agreement executed with the sun city cardiac center  an increase in the number of diagnostic procedures over the prior year in several of our diagnostic and therapeutic centers  and to the opening of three new diagnostic and therapeutic centers during the second quarter of fiscal these increases in net revenue were partially offset by a decrease attributable to the curtailment of procedures in one of our diagnostic and therapeutic centers that we elected to close in october due to the center s results of operations not meeting our long term strategic objectives 
the million decrease in our corporate and other division s net revenue was due to the settlement and expiration of one management contract during the third quarter of fiscal and another management contract during the first quarter of fiscal  offset in part by an increase in management fees and consulting fees we received from physicians remaining under management in our cardiology consulting and management operations 
on a same facility basis in our hospital division  which includes tucson heart hospital and excludes heart hospital of new mexico and mcallen heart hospital  net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal admissions decreased and adjusted admission declined 
these operating measures reflect the impact of certain events at two of our hospitals 
the first was our decision to convert the emergency department to a chest pain clinic at bakersfield heart hospital 
the primary reason we converted the emergency department to a chest pain clinic was in response to a payment dispute with a large managed care provider in that market 
as we anticipated at the time of the conversion  the hospital experienced a decline in overall admissions after the conversion 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we reached a favorable settlement with the managed care provider 
as a result of this settlement and other factors  we evaluated whether to reopen the emergency department provided it would not detract us from our primary mission of providing quality cardiovascular care 
in december  bakersfield heart hospital s board of directors approved such a plan to reopen the emergency department  and we reopened the emergency department during the second quarter of fiscal the second event affecting our same facility operating measures was our decision to terminate several managed care relationships  primarily associated with our tucson heart hospital  that we determined no longer met our long term strategic objectives 
the final event impacting our same facility operating measures was a reduction in available beds during the fourth quarter of fiscal at two of our hospitals due to renovations and repairs being performed at these facilities 
these renovations resulted in fewer beds being available at these two hospitals during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal all of these beds were placed back in service by the end of the first quarter of fiscal also on a same facility basis  inpatient catheterization procedures increased while inpatient surgical procedures decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal average length of stay in our same facility hospitals decreased to days for fiscal compared to days for fiscal personnel expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the million increase was primarily incurred by our hospital division and included million that was attributable to the net increase resulting from the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and our heart hospital of new mexico  offset in part by the decrease resulting from the sale of our mcallen heart hospital 
the remaining increase of million was primarily due to higher wage rates and benefit costs at our other hospitals  and an increase in use of contract nurses in certain of our hospitals during fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  personnel expense increased slightly to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the million of net revenue resulting from the bakersfield heart hospital billing dispute settlement  and the million of net revenue resulting from the sun city cardiac center settlement  personnel expense represented of net revenue for fiscal similarly  excluding the million of net revenue from the arbitration award in our diagnostics division  personnel expense represented of net revenue for fiscal medical supplies expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase was primarily incurred by our hospital division  and included a net increase of million resulting from the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and our heart hospital of new mexico  offset in part by the decrease resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital 
the remaining increase of  in our other hospitals was primarily due to the increased number of procedures performed during fiscal compared to fiscal  offset in part by the improved pricing realized from volume purchasing opportunities and vendor consolidation initiatives in our hospital division 
as a percentage of net revenue  medical supplies expense decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the million of net revenue resulting from the bakersfield heart hospital billing dispute settlement  and the million of net revenue resulting from the sun city cardiac center settlement  medical supplies expense represented of net revenue for fiscal similarly  excluding the million of net revenue from the arbitration award in our diagnostic services division  medical supplies expense represented of net revenue for fiscal bad debt expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase in bad debt expense was due to a million net increase resulting from the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and our heart hospital of new mexico  offset in part by the decrease resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital 
this million increase was partially offset by a million decrease in bad debt expense at our other hospitals 
our hospital division s days of net revenue in accounts receivable were days as of september  compared to days as of september  we attribute this decline in days and the decrease in our same facility hospitals bad debt expense to improved receivables collection procedures and other processes we have implemented in our business offices and the decline in aged receivables resulting from the bakersfield heart hospital billing dispute settlement 
as a percentage of net revenue  bad debt expense decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the million of net revenue resulting from the bakersfield heart hospital billing dispute settlement  and the million of net revenue resulting from the sun city cardiac center settlement  bad debt expense represented of net revenue for fiscal similarly  excluding the million of net revenue from the arbitration award in our diagnostic services division  bad debt expense represented of net revenue for fiscal other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal other operating expenses include primarily maintenance  rent  property taxes  insurance  utilities  advertising  travel  professional fees  contract services and support services provided to operating divisions by our corporate office 
of the million increase in other operating expenses  million occurred within our hospital division  of which million was due to the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and our heart hospital of new mexico  offset in part by the decrease resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital 
the remaining million increase in our hospital division s other operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in the medical malpractice insurance costs of our other hospitals resulting from the change in our insurance program during the third quarter of fiscal see critical accounting policies general and professional liability risk 
also contributing to this remaining increase in other operating expense was an increase in maintenance expense in our oldest hospital  an increase in property taxes in certain of our markets  and an increase in unreimbursed costs  primarily legal expense  incurred in connection with the bakersfield heart hospital billing dispute settlement 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease in sales and use and gross receipts taxes in one of our hospitals resulting from a favorable ruling by the state taxing authority in which that hospital operates that this hospital was exempt from the related taxes 
the diagnostics division s other operating expenses increased  due to the combined effect of the increased costs of medical malpractice coverage  as previously discussed  in that division and the net revenue growth in its operations  offset in part by cost reductions from exiting certain low margin services in that division 
the remaining million increase in other operating expenses occurred in our corporate and other division  and was due to an increase in our corporate expenses to support the growth in our operating divisions for fiscal compared to fiscal  offset in part by a decrease in the expenses of our cardiology consulting and management operations consistent with its decline in operations for fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  other operating expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal excluding the million of net revenue resulting from the bakersfield heart hospital billing dispute settlement  and the million of net revenue resulting from the sun city cardiac center settlement  other operating expenses represented of net revenue for fiscal similarly  excluding the million of net revenue from the arbitration award in our diagnostics division  other operating expenses represented of net revenue for fiscal pre opening expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal pre opening expenses represent expenses specifically related to projects under development  primarily new hospitals 
as of september   we had five hospitals under development  including harlingen medical center  louisiana heart hospital  heart hospital of san antonio  the heart hospital of milwaukee and heart hospital of lafayette 
as of september   we had three hospitals under development 
depreciation increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal of this million increase  million was due to the net increase resulting from the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and our heart hospital of new mexico  offset in part by the decrease resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital 
the remaining increase was primarily due to depreciation on capital expenditures related to equipment and information systems made since fiscal amortization decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to our adoption of sfas no 
on october  under the new accounting rules  we were required to discontinue goodwill amortization at the beginning of our fiscal and subject our goodwill to an annual impairment test  which was performed on a transitional basis as of october  and on a recurring annual basis as of september   and which did not result in any impairment losses 
for fiscal  we recognized goodwill amortization of approximately million 
the remaining decrease in amortization occurred in our corporate and other division and was due to the impairment of other intangible assets recognized in the second quarter of fiscal  and the write off of other intangible assets in connection with the settlement and expiration of another management contract in our cardiology consulting and management operations during the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we recognized an approximately million gain on the partial settlement of a cardiology management contract that occurred in december this gain is included in gain on sale of property  equipment and other asserts in our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease in interest expense occurred despite a million net increase in interest expense resulting from the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and heart hospital of new mexico  offset in part by the decrease resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital 
the decrease in interest expense excluding the effect of these three events was due to a general reduction in our variable rate interest costs and a reduction in our average total outstanding indebtedness during fiscal compared to fiscal the debt reduction was primarily due to the use of proceeds from the sale of mcallen heart hospital in march and our initial public offering in july to repay all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
also in july  three of our hospitals reduced their interest expense by refinancing approximately million of their mortgage debt 
interest income decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  which was primarily due to the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and our heart hospital of new mexico 
upon consolidation of each of these hospitals  we were required under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to begin eliminating interest income in our corporate division on working capital advances outstanding to these hospitals 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased million  or  to million for fiscal from a loss of million for fiscal equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates represents our share of the net earnings of hospitals in which we own less than a equity interest and over which we do not exercise substantive control 
in july  we began consolidating the financial results of our tucson heart hospital  and in october  we began consolidating the financial results of our heart hospital of new mexico after completing acquisitions that increased our ownership interests in each of these hospitals to a majority position 
we had previously been required to account for our minority investment in each of these hospitals using the equity method of accounting 
we have only one hospital in which we hold less than a equity interest and over which we do not have substantive control that we were required to account for as an equity investment during fiscal this hospital commenced operations in march we also continue to hold a small number of additional equity investments  primarily in our diagnostics division 
earnings allocated to minority interests decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the million decrease in earnings allocated to minority interests includes the effect of million recognized in the second quarter of fiscal resulting from the sale of mcallen heart hospital  million recognized in the third quarter of fiscal resulting from the amounts we received in the arbitration award involving a billing dispute with our hospital joint venture partner in one of our diagnostic and therapeutic centers  and the million recognized in the second quarter of fiscal resulting from the sun city cardiac settlement 
excluding these three events  earnings allocated to minority interests increased approximately million for fiscal compared to fiscal of this million increase  million was due to the consolidations of the financial results of our tucson heart hospital and heart hospital of new mexico  as previously discussed 
the remaining million increase was due to improved operating results in our other consolidated hospitals and improved operating results in certain joint ventures in our diagnostics division  offset in part by the increase in pre opening expenses for hospitals under development 
income tax expense increased to million for fiscal from  for fiscal during fiscal  we had net deferred tax assets  primarily resulting from net operating loss carryforwards that were fully offset by valuation allowances 
these offset net deferred tax assets also included the deferred tax asset related to our minority equity investment in our one remaining unconsolidated affiliate hospital 
during fiscal  we determined all of our valuation allowances were no longer required and reversed the allowances in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as a result of generating income before income taxes of million during fiscal and the reversal of all of our valuation allowances  we recognized million of deferred income tax expense along with  of current income tax expense during fiscal because we continued to have net operating loss carryforwards available from prior periods  we had no material income tax liability in fiscal selected quarterly results of operations 
the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly consolidated operating results for each of our last five quarters 
we have prepared this information on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements and included all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the data 
these quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
three months ended september  june  march  december  september  statement of operations data net revenue income loss from operations equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates minority interest net income loss cash flow and other data net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities our results of operations historically have fluctuated on a quarterly basis and can be expected to continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations 
cardiovascular procedures can often be scheduled ahead of time  permitting some patients to choose to undergo the procedure at a time and location of their preference 
some of the types of trends that we have experienced in the past and may experience again in the future include the markets where some of our hospitals are located are susceptible to seasonal population changes with part time residents living in the area only during certain months of the year  patients choosing to schedule procedures around significant dates  such as holidays  and physicians in the market where a hospital is located schedule vacation from their practice during the summer months of the year  around holidays and for various professional meetings held throughout the world during the year 
to the extent these types of events occur in the future  as in the past  we expect they will affect the quarterly results of operations of our hospitals 
liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash flow activities 
our consolidated working capital was million at september  and million at september  the decrease of million in working capital resulted primarily from a decrease in cash and cash equivalents combined with increases in accounts payable  accrued compensation and benefits  accrued property taxes  other accrued liabilities and current portion of long term debt  offset in part by increases in accounts receivable  net  medical supplies and current deferred income tax assets combined with decreases in short term borrowings and accrued construction and developments costs 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents primarily resulted from the repayment of a third party working capital loan at one of our hospitals  working capital needs related to harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital  repayments of obligations under capital leases  distributions to minority partners  cash used to acquire an increased ownership interest in one of our hospitals  purchases of common stock for treasury and capital expenditures principally related to harlingen medical center  louisiana heart hospital and our three hospitals under development at september  the capital expenditure for our hospitals under development included million of cash used to fund construction costs at heart hospital of lafayette  which were subsequently funded through mortgage debt borrowings during october these decreases to cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by cash flows provided by operations  net proceeds from borrowings to fund the capital expenditures for harlingen medical center  louisiana heart hospital and our three hospitals under development  as well as a net decrease in investments in and advances to our unconsolidated affiliate hospital 
the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of our payment cycle  which resulted in an increase in unpaid vendor invoices as of september  compared to the number of unpaid vendor invoices as of september   and an increase in activity at the heart hospital of milwaukee during the fourth quarter of fiscal in preparation of its october opening 
the increase in accrued compensation and benefits at september  was primarily due to several factors  including an increase in deferred compensation under nurse retention arrangements at two of our hospitals  an increase in accrued severance for certain of our previous executive officers  net of bonuses not paid  and an increase in accrued salaries and benefits due to higher staffing levels at several of our hospitals 
the increases in staffing included harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital related to the ramp up of these two new hospitals  bakersfield heart hospital related to the reopening of its emergency department and the heart hospital of milwaukee related to its october opening 
the increase in other accrued liabilities primarily resulted from the increase in medical malpractice reserves  the opening of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital and the increase in the level of pre opening activities in our three hospitals under development as of september  the increase in current portion of long term debt during fiscal was primarily due to the reclassifying million of long term debt to current portion of long term debt at bakersfield heart hospital and an increase at harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital  which began making principal payments toward their outstanding debt during fiscal as discussed below  the amended loan terms for bakersfield heart hospital resulted in a principal prepayment of approximately million on december  because this prepayment was due and paid within the twelve month period following september   we are required under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to classify the amount as current in our consolidated balance sheet at september  the increase in accounts receivable  net  resulted from the opening of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital during fiscal and growth in our net revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  offset in part by increased collections in our hospital division due to procedures and processes we have implemented in our business offices 
the increase in medical supplies primarily resulted from the opening of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital and purchases of inventory at the heart hospital of milwaukee during the fourth quarter of fiscal in preparation of its october opening 
the decrease in the short term borrowings at september  compared to september  was due to the repayment of a working capital loan at one of our hospitals during fiscal the decrease in accrued construction and development costs resulted from the financing of equipment purchases that were accrued at september  with borrowings under equipment notes payable during fiscal at harlingen medical center  offset in part by increased construction activity at our three hospitals under development at september  a significant portion of our changes in working capital was due to the opening and subsequent operating activities of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital 
consistent with this trend from september  to september   we expect our working capital to fluctuate as our hospitals under development progress through the development period and ramp up period 
specifically  we expect our working capital to decrease as accounts payable and accrued liabilities increase as each hospital nears its opening and working capital to increase subsequent to each hospital s opening as accounts receivable  net  increase from its operating activities 
our operating activities provided net cash of million for fiscal compared to net cash of million for fiscal the million net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was the result of cash flow provided by our operations and the net changes in our working capital as discussed above 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was primarily the result of cash flow provided by our operations which included the favorable settlement of the sun city cardiac center billing dispute and the favorable settlement of a billing dispute with a managed care company and a net decrease in our working capital 
the decrease in working capital during fiscal resulted primarily from increases in accrued construction and development costs  short term borrowings  accounts payable  accrued compensation and benefits and current portion of long term debt  offset in part by increases in cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  net  medical supplies  deferred tax assets and prepaid expenses and other current assets combined with a decrease in accrued property taxes and other accrued liabilities 
our investing activities used net cash of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the million of net cash used by investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to our capital expenditures  which were principally for harlingen medical center  louisiana heart hospital and our three hospitals under development as of september  the million of net cash used by investing activities for fiscal was primarily due to our capital expenditures principally related to our hospitals under development  our acquisition of the increased ownership in heart hospital of new mexico and our acquisition of a management contract  offset in part by a net decrease in investments in and advances to our unconsolidated affiliate hospital and proceeds from the settlement of a management contract 
we expect to continue to invest cash in our hospital under development in fiscal our financing activities provided net cash of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the million of net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  net of loan acquisition costs  of million  offset in part by repayments of short term borrowings  long term debt and capital lease obligations of million  distributions to  net of investments by  minority partners of million and purchases of common stock for treasury of  the million of net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of short term borrowings and long term debt  net of loan acquisition costs of million offset in part by repayments of long term debt and capital lease obligations of million and distributions to  net of investments by  minority partners of million 
we expect to continue to obtain capital principally through proceeds from issuance of long term debt related to our hospitals under development 
capital expenditures 
expenditures for property and equipment for fiscal years and were million and million  respectively 
included in the million of capital expenditures for fiscal were capital expenditures of million for harlingen medical center  louisiana heart hospital and our hospitals under development 
included in the million of capital expenditures for fiscal were capital expenditures of million for harlingen medical center  louisiana heart hospital and our hospitals under development at that time 
in addition  we incurred million and million of capital lease obligations during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we also accrued million and million of capital expenditures for construction and development costs related to our hospitals under development at september  and we expect our capital expenditures for our hospitals under development will decrease for fiscal compared to fiscal due to the anticipated completion of our remaining hospitals under development during the first six months of fiscal future capital expenditures will depend upon the level of development activity we engage in and the level of replacement of existing property and equipment required in future periods 
obligations  commitments and availability of financing 
as described more fully in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we had certain cash obligations at september   which are due as follows in thousands thereafter total long term debt obligations under capital leases total debt other long term obligations  excluding interest rate swaps operating leases  net of rental income total other long term obligations  excluding interest rate swaps  consists of non current portion of deferred compensation under nurse retention arrangements at two of our hospitals and a working capital note due to a hospital investor partner at one of our hospitals 
the working capital note obligation is due as funds are available and therefore is included in the thereafter category in the above table 
at september   we had million of outstanding debt  million of which was classified as current 
of the million of outstanding debt  million was outstanding to lenders to our hospitals and included million outstanding under capital leases 
the remaining million of debt was outstanding to lenders to our diagnostic services and corporate and other divisions under capital leases and other miscellaneous indebtedness  primarily equipment notes payable and capital leases 
no amounts were outstanding to lenders under our million revolving credit facility at september  at the same date  however  we had letters of credit outstanding of million  which reduced our availability under this facility to million 
in addition to the million of outstanding debt at september   we had a million working capital note due to a hospital investor partner at one of our hospitals that will be repaid as funds are available and is included in other long term obligations 
in addition to the debt described above and our cash obligations under operating leases  we expect to incur additional indebtedness during fiscal as we anticipate completing the development of our new hospitals 
the development and construction of the hospitals we had under development at september  in texas  louisiana and wisconsin will require us to incur additional long term debt of between million and million during the next months 
we expect approximately million of this additional long term debt will be mortgage debt  all of which is available from designated  but unused  commitments and remaining undesignated borrowings available under the master credit facility as of september  we expect the remaining approximately million of additional long term debt will be equipment debt primarily financed through a combination of debt and capital leases provided by lenders affiliated with the equipment vendors 
we became a party to a new million master credit facility in july in connection with our initial public offering 
in addition to providing a source of capital to refinance approximately million of the indebtedness of three of our existing hospitals  the master credit facility provided us with million to finance the construction and development of new hospitals under our hospital development program 
in march  the master credit facility was amended to increase borrowings by million thereby providing a total of million of available debt to finance our hospital development program 
as of september   million of the initial million had been designated  of which million had been borrowed to finance the development of harlingen medical center  louisiana heart hospital  texsan heart hospital and the heart hospital of milwaukee 
in october  million of the million available for this purpose was designated for use in funding the development of heart hospital of lafayette 
as of october   million of the million remains available to finance other hospital projects that we may begin in future periods 
the master credit facility matures on july  and borrowings bear interest at libor plus a margin that ranges from to 
we are required to pay an unused commitment fee each month at a rate of 
the master credit facility includes covenants that require maintenance of certain financial ratios regarding leverage levels and debt service coverage as well as various restrictive covenants 
in may  harlingen medical center obtained a debt commitment of up to million to finance its equipment 
amounts funded under the loan accrue interest at a fixed rate of interest equal to a specific treasury note yield  plus a margin 
upon the conversion of the loan to a fixed rate of interest  the principal amount outstanding will be repaid over a time period equal to either five or seven years  depending on the type and manufacturer of equipment originally purchased under the facility 
as of september   harlingen medical center had borrowed million of the million available and the remaining  unused portion of the commitment expired 
in december  louisiana heart hospital  which opened february   obtained a debt commitment to finance its equipment that allows the hospital to borrow up to million 
until december  interest on borrowings made under this commitment will accrue at day libor plus 
after such date  amounts funded under the loan shall accrue interest at either a fixed rate equal to a specific treasury note yield  plus a margin  or day libor  plus a margin  depending on the manufacturer of the equipment originally purchased under the facility 
beginning in december  the principal amount of the loan will be repaid over a six year period 
as of september   louisiana heart hospital had borrowed million of the million available 
in october  louisiana heart hospital borrowed an additional million of the million commitment and the remaining million unused portion of the commitment expired 
in july  texsan heart hospital obtained a debt commitment of up to million to finance its equipment purchases 
until march  interest on borrowings made under this commitment shall accrue at prime  plus a margin 
beginning in march  borrowings shall bear interest at a fixed rate of interest equal to a specific treasury note yield  plus a margin 
principal shall be payable in months beginning in september as of september   no borrowings were outstanding under the commitment 
in november  milwaukee heart hospital obtained a million debt commitment to finance equipment purchases 
amounts borrowed under this commitment shall accrue at a base rate  plus a margin  or libor  plus a margin 
principal amount borrowed under this commitment are due march as of september   the three hospitals under development and louisiana heart hospital were committed and had paid and accrued amounts under their construction contracts as set forth in the table below in millions amount amount amount committed paid accrued louisiana heart hospital texsan heart hospital the heart hospital of milwaukee heart hospital of lafayette separate from our master credit facility as discussed above  our revolving credit facility provides million in availability  million of which is designated for short term borrowings and million of which is available to issue letters of credit 
as of september   we had used million of this availability to issue letters of credit and consequently had availability for additional borrowings of million under the revolving credit facility  of which million is available for additional letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility matures on january  and borrowings under the facility bear interest at either the libor or the prime rate plus various applicable margins that are based upon financial covenant ratio tests 
we are required to pay a quarterly unused commitment fee at a rate of for available  but unused  long term borrowings and for available  but unused  short term borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility includes various restrictive covenants  including restrictions on certain types of additional indebtedness  investments  asset sales  capital expenditures  dividends  sale and leasebacks  contingent obliga tions  transactions with affiliates  changes in our corporate structure  and fundamental changes 
the covenants also require maintenance of various ratios regarding leverage levels and debt service coverage 
at september   we were in violation of certain financial ratio covenants related to the real estate mortgage loans at arizona heart hospital  tucson heart hospital and heart hospital of austin 
we were also not in compliance with certain guarantor financial ratio covenants related to the real estate loans at heart hospital of austin and heart hospital of new mexico 
we received waivers of the covenant breaches from each lender 
in addition  the lender at tucson heart hospital agreed to waive compliance with certain of its financial covenants through  and including  march   and the lender at arizona heart hospital agreed to modify the terms of its financing to accommodate the hospital s anticipated future operating performance 
also  at december   bakersfield heart hospital was not in compliance with one of its financial ratio covenants 
the mortgage lender granted a waiver for the breach at december  and agreed to amend the terms of the loan to replace the financial ratio covenant with a minimum financial performance covenant at june  and september  under the amended loan terms  the financial ratio covenant would have become effective again december  and would have determined the amount of a potential prepayment of the loan s principal balance 
in november  the mortgage lender agreed to further amend the terms of the loan to accommodate a potential change in capital reimbursement at the hospital 
under the terms of the november amendment  the mortgage lender agreed to amend both the financial ratio covenants and the minimum financial performance covenants 
in consideration of the amendment  we remitted a prepayment of approximately million on december  accordingly  we have classified this amount of bakersfield heart hospital s mortgage debt as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at september  except as noted above  we were in compliance with all other covenants in the instruments governing our outstanding debt at september  we guarantee either all or a portion of the obligations of our subsidiary hospitals for bank mortgage loans 
we also guarantee a portion of the obligations of our subsidiary hospitals for equipment and other notes payable 
we provide these guarantees in accordance with the related hospital operating agreements  and we receive a fee for providing these guarantees from the hospitals or the physician investors 
we also guarantee approximately of the real estate and of the equipment debt of heart hospital of south dakota  the one hospital in which we owned a minority interest at september   and therefore do not consolidate the hospital s results of operation and financial position 
we provide such guarantee in exchange for a fee from the hospital 
we believe that internally generated cash flows and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million  together with the remaining net proceeds of our initial public offering of million  borrowings available under the master credit facility not yet designated for a development hospital of million  borrowings available under equipment debt commitments of million  cash balances in our development hospitals of million  and other long term debt and capital leases we expect to incur will be sufficient to finance our hospital development program  other capital expenditures and our working capital requirements for the next to months 
while we believe the aforementioned capital resources are sufficient to fund our hospital development program  other capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the specified period  we periodically may evaluate and pursue other financing alternatives  including amending or replacing our bank debt or issuing additional equity or debt securities  to supplement or replace our current sources of capital 
intercompany financing arrangements 
medcath corporation uses intercompany financing arrangements to provide cash support to individual hospitals for their working capital and other corporate needs  including the needs of our new hospitals during the ramp up period and any periodic or ongoing needs of our other hospitals 
we provide these working capital loans pursuant to the terms of the operating agreements between our physician and hospital investor partners and us at each of our hospitals 
these intercompany loans are evidenced by promissory notes that establish borrowing limits and provide for a market rate of interest to be paid to medcath corporation on outstanding balances 
these intercompany loans are subordinated to each hospital s mortgage and equipment debt outstanding  but are senior to our equity interests and those of our partners in the hospital 
they are secured in each instance by a junior lien on the borrowing hospital s accounts receivable 
as of september  and  we held a total of million and million  respectively  of these intercompany notes 
because these intercompany notes receivable and related interest income are eliminated with the corresponding notes payable and interest expense at our consolidating hospitals in the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the amounts outstanding under these notes do not appear in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes 
information about the aggregate amount of these notes outstanding from time to time may be helpful  however  in understanding the amount of our total investment in our hospitals 
in addition  we believe investors and others will benefit from a greater understanding of the significance of the priority rights we have under these intercompany notes receivable to distributions of cash by our hospitals as funds are generated from future operations  a potential sale of a hospital  or other sources 
because these notes receivable are senior to the equity interests of medcath and our partners in each hospital  in the event of a sale of a hospital  the hospital would be required first to pay to us any balance outstanding under its intercompany note prior to distributing any of the net proceeds of the sale to any of the hospital s equity investors as a return on their investment based on their pro rata ownership interests 
also  appropriate payments to us to amortize principal balances outstanding and to pay interest due under these notes are generally made to us from a hospital s available cash flows prior to any pro rata distributions of a hospital s earnings to the equity investors in the hospitals 
the aggregate amount of these intercompany loans outstanding fluctuates from time to time depending upon our hospitals needs for capital resources 
we have during fiscal  and will continue in future periods  provided information on a quarterly basis about the aggregate amount of these intercompany loans outstanding to assist investors in better understanding the total amount of our investment in our hospitals  our claim to the future cash flows of our hospitals  and our capital structure 
reimbursement  legislative and regulatory changes legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing changes in reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs that will continue to limit payments we receive under these programs 
within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to legislative and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations  and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs  and the federal and state governments may  in the future  reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of our hospitals or require other changes in our operations 
additionally  there may be a continued rise in managed care programs and future restructuring of the financing and delivery of healthcare in the united states 
these events could have an adverse effect on our future financial results 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages  such as the growing nationwide shortage of qualified nurses  occur in the marketplace 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have implemented cost control measures  including our case and resource management program  to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
we have to date offset increases in operating costs by increasing reimbursement for services and expanding services 
however  we cannot predict our ability to cover  or offset  future cost increases 
recent and proposed accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the objective of fin is to record the fair value of a guarantee at inception and require disclosure of all such guarantees in interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and initial fair value measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  our adoption and application of fin did not have any material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations as of and for the year ended september  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for disclosures regarding our guarantees as required by fin in december  the fasb issued sfas no

in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either i does not have equity investors with voting rights  the obligation to absorb expected losses  and the right to receive expected residual returns  or ii has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the expected losses or residual returns from the variable interest entity s activities or both 
since issuing fin  the fasb has proposed various amendments to the interpretation and has twice deferred the effective dates 
most recently on december   the fasb approved a partial deferral of fin and announced that it expects to release the revised version of fin hereinafter  fin r before december  this partial deferral established the effective dates for public entities to apply fin and fin r based on the nature of the variable interest entity and the date upon which the public company became involved with the variable interest entity 
in general  the deferral provides that i for variable interest entities created after february   a public entity must apply fin r at the end of the first interim or annual period ending after march   and may be required to apply fin at the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  if the variable interest entity is a special purpose entity  and ii for variable interest entities created after january   a public company must apply fin at the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december   as previously required  and then apply fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  as of september   we did not have any variable interest entities created after january  we are currently in the process of applying fin to our entities created before february  to determine which  if any  are variable interest entities and the impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain a policy for managing risk related to exposure to variability in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rates and prices which includes considering entering into derivative instruments or contracts or instruments containing features or terms that behave in a manner similar to derivative instruments in order to mitigate our risks 
in addition  we may be required to hedge some or all of our market risk exposure  especially to interest rates  by creditors who provide debt funding to us 
to date  we have only entered into the fixed interest rate swaps as discussed below 
as required by their mortgage loans  three of our consolidated heart hospitals entered into fixed interest rate swaps during the fourth quarter of fiscal year these fixed interest rate swaps effectively fixed the interest rate on the hedged portion of the related debt at plus the applicable margin for two of the hospitals and at plus the applicable margin for the other hospital

our debt obligations at september  included approximately million of variable rate debt at an approximate average interest rate of 
a one hundred basis point change in interest rates on our variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million   and million for the years ended september   and  respectively
