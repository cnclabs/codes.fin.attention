item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the results of operations of napro biotherapeutics  inc you should read this discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  referred to as the reform act 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
general we are a pharmaceutical company focused in three distinct areas the production and sale of paclitaxel  an approved cancer drug  the development of targeted oncology products  and the development of novel genomic technologies  primarily in the area of gene editing for applications in human therapeutics  diagnostics  agribiotechnology and pharmacogenomics 
our first and only commercialized product is paclitaxel  a naturally occurring chemotherapeutic anti cancer agent found in certain species of yew  or taxus trees 
in addition to our efforts with paclitaxel and genomics  we are also working on several types of compounds that we believe have promising activity as anti cancer agents 
we believe some of these agents function by novel mechanisms  which may increase their likelihood of success as new chemotherapeutics 
we are also actively engaged in evaluating the in licensing or purchase of potential new products and or technologies  whether or not those products or technologies are derived from natural products 
our evaluation of new products and technologies may involve the examination of individual molecules  classes of compounds  or platform technologies  in both cancer and other therapeutic areas 
acquisitions of new products or technologies may involve the purchase of such products or technologies  or the acquisition of  or merger with  other companies 
we continue to incur substantial research and development expense related to the development of novel  targeted anti cancer agents  and the development of novel genomic technologies  primarily in the area of gene editing  for applications in human therapeutics  diagnostics  agribiotechnology and pharmacogenomics  as well as the improvement of our paclitaxel yield  the reduction of our long term cost of product and the development of our semisynthesis process 
accordingly  we have incurred significant losses  including losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our accumulated deficit was million as of december  we anticipate that losses may continue until such time  if ever  as we are able to generate sufficient sales to support our development operations  including the research and development activity mentioned above 
our ability to generate sufficient sales to support our operations currently depends primarily upon the successful commercialization of our worldwide paclitaxel program 
our strategy for that program has been to form strategic alliances through long term exclusive agreements with established pharmaceutical companies 
in  we entered into an exclusive collaborative agreement of up to years covering the us and canada with abbott laboratories abbott to develop and commercialize one or more formulations of paclitaxel for the treatment of a variety of cancers 
under our agreement with abbott  we are responsible for supply of bulk drug  development activity is conducted jointly 
abbott is responsible for finishing  regulatory filings  marketing  and sale of the finished drug product 
most primary decisions related to the paclitaxel development program are made by a joint abbott napro development committee 
in march  we and abbott filed an anda with the fda for paclitaxel 
the fda granted approval 
table of contents of this anda on may  we received an approval for a second anda on august   which provides for greater manufacturing flexibility for the generic paclitaxel product 
in connection with the abbott agreement  we may receive total funding of up to million in the form of up to million in development milestones  up to million in marketing milestones  million in secured debt  and million in equity investments 
marketing milestones are based upon certain annual sales levels  the majority of which are unlikely to be achieved given the current pricing of paclitaxel 
through december   and excluding product sales  we received million under the agreement  including million in equity investments in exchange for  shares of our common stock  million in development milestones  and million in secured debt 
of the million of potential development related milestone payments  we received million upon execution of our agreement with abbott in july with the approval of our anda  and upon commencement of commercial sales  we received an million payment in may thus  million in possible development milestones remain 
additional development milestones will only be available should napro or abbott undertake and successfully complete new development work  which is not currently anticipated 
we have received million of secured debt from abbott 
the debt bears a primary interest rate of and is due in full on the earlier of i the second anniversary of the first sale of finished product by abbott to a wholesaler or end user customer following approval of finished product by the fda may   ii the termination of the abbott agreement  or iii january  the debt is limited to a borrowing base of collateralized assets  recomputed monthly 
the majority of our paclitaxel inventories  and specific assets which relate to the manufacture of paclitaxel  are collateralized as security for the debt 
abbott s only recourse in the event of our default on the debt is to these specific assets 
contingent upon achieving certain commercial sales thresholds for all approved formulations of paclitaxel over several years  we may receive marketing milestone payments from abbott of up to million 
given the current pricing of paclitaxel  we believe that the majority of these annual sales thresholds are unlikely to be achieved 
under terms of the agreement  abbott purchases bulk drug from us 
abbott may terminate the agreement at any time with or without cause 
should abbott terminate without cause  it is obligated to make certain payments to us and to give us twelve months prior written notice 
since the approval of generic paclitaxel in mid  the selling price of paclitaxel has fallen significantly  and may continue to do so 
we receive a fixed price payment of per gram  upon delivery of paclitaxel to abbott  plus a quarterly royalty payment  if any 
the royalty payment is a percentage of sales recorded by abbott less any product payment already paid to us 
the percentage of sales varies each year based upon total sales in that year recorded by abbott 
we do not anticipate receiving significant royalty payments given the current price of the drug 
in  we entered into a year exclusive agreement with fh faulding co  ltd 
faulding  a large australian pharmaceutical company  for the clinical development  sale  marketing and distribution of paclitaxel 
in october  faulding was acquired by mayne nickless limited  an australian based health care provider and logistics operator 
as a result  faulding is now known as mayne pharma 
mayne pharma actively markets anti cancer pharmaceuticals and other health care products in europe  australia  asia  south america  and other regions throughout the world 
in  we amended the mayne pharma agreement to  among other things  add additional countries to mayne pharma s exclusive territory 
in 
table of contents  we entered into a separate agreement with mayne pharma covering development and sale of paclitaxel in europe 
we cannot assure that we will receive regulatory approval in any of the major markets in europe 
should we receive approval  mayne pharma will then market and sell our paclitaxel in europe 
we and mayne pharma will share equally the net sales of the product in europe 
including the new agreement for europe  the mayne pharma territory includes substantially all of the world other than the us  canada  japan  israel  the former soviet union and parts of africa 
mayne pharma has received marketing approval for  and is selling paclitaxel as anzatax in more than countries 
in july  the european patent office  opposition division  ruled that napro s currently issued paclitaxel formulation patent in the european patent convention is invalid 
we have appealed this ruling and expect the appeal to be heard within the next months 
we do not believe this decision will have any effect outside of the jurisdiction of the european patent office  nor will it affect our ability to enter the market in europe as regulatory approvals are received 
we also do not believe this patent decision will affect our revenues or earnings through calendar year in january  we received approval in israel to sell paclitaxel under the trade name biotax 
we have established an exclusive supply and distribution agreement with tzamal pharma tzamal for the development and distribution of paclitaxel in israel 
the israeli ministry of health has approved biotax for use in treating a variety of cancers 
in june  we and jcr pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
jcr entered into a mutually exclusive development  supply and distribution agreement for paclitaxel in japan 
under the agreement  we will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying the finished drug 
we and jcr will jointly be responsible for the clinical and regulatory program necessary for seeking approval to market paclitaxel in japan 
jcr will be responsible for the sales and distribution of the product in japan upon its approval 
we cannot assure  however  that we will receive regulatory approval of paclitaxel in japan  or that we and our strategic partner will successfully market it 
research and development research and development are major activities for us 
we discussed the nature and status of our research and development in depth in this form k annual report in item business  in the general  paclitaxel  paclitaxel strategic alliances  biomass  paclitaxel manufacturing  targeted oncology  genomics  patents and proprietary technology  government regulation and product approvals  competition and research and development sections  and in the general section of this management s discussion and analysis 
we have incurred the following expense on research and development projects  including process improvements in our paclitaxel business in thousands oncology genomics research and development is expected to remain a significant expense of our business 
our research and development activity is subject to change as we develop a better understanding of our projects and their prospects 
we currently expect to concentrate on the development of novel  targeted anti cancer agents  
table of contents and the development of novel genomic technologies  primarily in the area of gene editing  for applications in human therapeutics  diagnostics  agribiotechnology and pharmacogenomics 
we anticipate bringing our targeted oncology program to the clinic during the first half of our sickle cell disease and huntington s disease programs are expected to go into the clinic during or the beginning of however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve the timing of these programs 
we also cannot estimate the cost of the effort necessary to complete the programs or the timing of commencement of material net cash inflows from these programs 
continued development of these programs is dependent upon additional capital 
we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain such capital on terms  which are acceptable to us 
we have included a number of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development on schedule in the special note regarding forward looking statements  below 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  product sales 
product sales for were million  an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase during was primarily attributable to shipments to abbott as a result of our fda approval on may  sales to abbott for the current year were million  an increase of million from sales to mayne pharma for the current year were million  a decrease of  from the prior year 
sales to tzamal for the current year were million  a decrease of  from the prior year 
future sales are difficult to predict and are expected to vary from year to year depending upon numerous demand and competitive factors 
among these factors are the relationship of competitors with their customers  the relationship of abbott  mayne pharma and tzamal with its customers and the amount of competitor product in the distribution channel 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for was million  an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volume produced  which was partially offset by a decrease in unit production cost due to improved yields and increased productivity 
as a result  the gross margin increased to in from a negative in the prior year 
we continue to look for improvements and cost saving measures to improve our gross margin in future periods 
research and development expense 
research and development expense for was million  an increase of million from genomics research and development increased million from  while oncology research and development decreased  from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to increased staffing million  legal costs associated with patent development million and occupancy costs associated with development facilities 
these amounts were partially offset by a reduction in supplies expenses  as well as a one time charge for development costs  which we incurred in the prior year 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for was million  an increase of million from the increase was primarily due to increased staffing million  general legal expenses  insurance  and services provided by third parties 
these amounts were partially offset by reductions in a number of areas  including supplies and recruiting expenses 
license fee income 
license fee income for was million  an increase of million from the increase was attributable to our receipt of a one time milestone payment of million from abbott upon commencement of commercial sales in the united states 

table of contents interest income 
interest income for was  a decrease of  from the prior year 
the decrease was attributable to lower average balances of interest bearing investments  as well as lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense for was million  an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of million in convertible debt during the first quarter of  including amortization of the discount attributable to the conversion feature 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  product sales 
product sales for were million  an increase of million from the prior year 
sales to abbott for were million  an increase of million from sales to mayne pharma for were million  a decrease of  from sales to tzamal for were million  an increase of million from cost of sales 
cost of sales for was million  an increase of million from the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in volume million and an increase in unit production cost million 
the unit production cost increased as we rapidly expanded capacity by modifying equipment for increased volume and by adding shifts  resulting in training and other start up cost 
research and development expense 
research and development expense for was million  an increase of million from genomics research and development increased million from  while oncology research and development increased million from the prior year 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense for was million  an increase of million from the increase is primarily attributable to increased staffing million and increased consulting expense 
asset writedowns 
asset writedowns for were million  a decrease of  from in we recorded a million writedown of production equipment in the boulder extraction facility related to operations that we transferred to a lower cost third party vendor 
we expensed preliminary engineering and design cost of a considered new production facility when we determined that we could expand capacity in our existing facilities sufficiently to meet near term demand 
the amount was attributable to prior construction cost that was not applicable in the redesign of the manufacturing facilities in boulder  colorado 
license fee income 
license fee income for was million 
there was no similar amount in although license fees and milestone payments are unusual and may be non recurring  million was received under the mayne pharma european agreement and million under the jcr japanese agreement 
the income represents amortization of these payments 
interest income 
interest income for was  an increase of  from the increase was primarily attributable to higher overall balances of interest bearing investments 
interest expense 
interest expense for was million  an increase of  from the increase was primarily attributable to a higher balance on the abbott loan 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements have been  and will continue to be  significant 
as of december   we had a working capital balance of million compared to a working capital balance of million as of december  to date  we have funded our capital requirements primarily with the net proceeds of public offerings of common stock of approximately million  with private placements of equity securities of approximately million  with the exercise of warrants and options of million and with net borrowing of million 
in february  we sold privately million of common stock issued at per share and million principal of five year debentures convertible into common stock at per share to tl ventures v  lp and one of its affiliated funds 
no placement agent was involved in the transaction 
the net proceeds were million 
as part of this transaction  we recorded a discount attributable to the conversion feature of the convertible debentures in the amount of million  which is being amortized over the term of the debentures 
during the first quarter of  we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to register the resale of the common stock  common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures and common stock issuable in lieu of cash interest on the debentures under the securities act of in july  the registration statement was declared effective by the sec 
napro may pay the debenture interest in cash or common stock at its option 
the debentures automatically convert into common stock during the first two years if the average price of the common stock for trading days exceeds  and during the last three years if the average price for trading days exceeds if we have insufficient funds to repay the debentures in full at maturity or upon acceleration  the holders of the debentures may elect to convert the outstanding principal balance and any unpaid accrued interest on the debentures into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to the then current day average trading price of the common stock 
the conversion price of the common stock in such a circumstance could be materially below the price at which we otherwise would be willing to issue our common stock 
issuance of common stock at such a price could result in substantial dilution to our other stockholders and could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in december  we acquired the genomics business of pangene corporation for million in cash and assumption of debt obligations totaling approximately  the acquisition consisted primarily of patents and intellectual property relating to pangene s homologous recombination technology and gene isolation and service business  physical assets  instrumentation  software  customer relationships and third party licenses 
the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets totaling  fixed assets and software of  and other current assets of  in process research and development of  was expensed at the time of the acquisition 
we will amortize intangible assets over to years  and fixed assets and software over years 
in connection with this agreement  we acquired additional patents in january in the amount of  in november  we entered into a year gene editing technology license with the university of delaware and thomas jefferson university relating to the use of proprietary oligonucleotides dna fragments designed to precisely alter genes in humans  animals  plants  viruses and microbes 
the license provides for research and patent funding commitments and payments in common stock 
to date  we have issued  shares under the license agreement 
assuming we do not cancel the license  we will issue an additional  shares in  share per year increments on the license anniversaries 
we may  at our option  accelerate the issuance dates 
certain milestones may also accelerate the issuance dates 
the license is terminable at napro s option 
if terminated  no further shares would be issued 
we have committed to fund at least  in research under this agreement during 
table of contents we believe existing capital and projected sales  as well as the conversion of current inventory and accounts receivable  will provide adequate capital to fund our operations and capital expenditures in however  pharmaceutical development is a costly and time consuming process 
we may in license or purchase new products or technologies 
the cost of acquiring and developing such resources  and related capital expenditures  may be very large 
as a result  we may seek additional capital 
we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain such capital on terms  which are acceptable to us 
working capital and cash flow cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million at december  during  net cash used in operating activities of million and in investing activities of million was partially offset with net cash provided by financing activities of million 
inventory was million at december   of which million is classified as non current 
non current inventory consists of raw materials which are not expected to be utilized during  due to the timing of biomass harvests and anticipated future changes to our production process 
the amount of inventory is dependent on a number of factors  including the shipping requirements of our strategic partners  our production planning for meeting those needs  and the timing of seasonal biomass harvests 
inventory balances may vary significantly during product development  launch periods and during seasonal harvests 
accounts receivable was million at december  we anticipate that the level of our accounts receivable will decrease significantly during capital expenditures we spent million during for capital projects 
these expenditures primarily included manufacturing capacity expansion  plantation cost and laboratory equipment purchases 
the amount and timing of future capital expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including the development of new products  the acquisition of new products or technologies  the cost of manufacturing resources for new products  the nature of our relationship with our strategic partners  the progress of our research and development programs  changes in manufacturing processes  the magnitude and scope of these activities  competing technological and marketing developments  and changes in or terminations of existing strategic relationships 
we anticipate a significant reduction of capital expenditures during the primary focus of capital spending during is expected to be in our research and development areas 
although we may seek additional long term financing to fund capital expenditures  we cannot assure that we can obtain such financing on terms  which are acceptable to us 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
tax law provides limits on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards if there has been a change of ownership as described in section of 
table of contents the internal revenue code 
such a change of ownership may limit our utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards  and could be triggered by sales of securities by us or our stockholders 
business development activities in the normal course of our business  we investigate  evaluate  and discuss licensing relationships  acquisitions  and other business combination opportunities in the pharmaceutical and genomics businesses 
in the event we enter into any such relationships or transactions  we may consider using available cash  issuing equity securities or increasing our debt 
such transactions could materially affect our capital structure 
critical accounting policies we have identified certain accounting policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout this item where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates policy the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
inventory policy we state inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
inventory  which is not expected to be utilized during  has been classified as a non current asset 
we periodically review the composition of our inventory for slow moving and obsolete items 
if deemed appropriate  we record a reserve against those inventory items 
plantation cost policy we have determined the cultivation of renewable sources of biomass to be used in the manufacture of paclitaxel is a technically feasible business strategy 
paclitaxel is a naturally occurring cancer fighting compound found in certain species of yew taxus trees 
we capitalize plantation expenditures incurred prior to the first commercial harvest on each planting of trees 
plantation expenditures include the acquisition cost of trees and the related cost of planting and growing 
we deplete such cost using estimated units of production over the expected number of annual harvests 
the number and timing of harvests can vary depending on product demand 
long lived assets policy in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  we review the carrying amount of long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest they may be impaired 
if this review indicates long lived assets will not be recoverable as determined based on the undiscounted cash flow estimated to be generated by these assets  we reduce the carrying amount of these long lived assets to estimated fair value or discounted cash flow  as appropriate 
comment on inventory  plantation cost and other long lived assets policies we have invested substantial amounts of capital in these assets 
our accurate measurement and evaluation of these assets is important to the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines regarding capitalization of cost  market valuation  and potential impairment of these assets  and provide any necessary allowances as required

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during  we sold a significant amount of paclitaxel to mayne pharma 
under the mayne pharma agreement  mayne pharma pays us a fixed percentage of their sales price for paclitaxel 
each year  mayne 
table of contents pharma estimates the sales price it will receive in the upcoming year  and  based upon that estimate  we determine the price we will charge mayne pharma 
we recognize the corresponding sales at the time of shipment to mayne pharma 
however  mayne pharma s actual selling price may differ from that estimated 
pursuant to the agreement  mayne pharma is obligated to provide us with their calculation of the actual sales price for sales made during the preceding year  and an adjustment is calculated that may increase or decrease our sales of products to mayne pharma during that year 
mayne pharma s sales are made in the currencies of each of the countries in which it sells paclitaxel 
as a result  our sales are affected by fluctuations in the value of these various foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
in the past  currency fluctuations were a significant factor in reductions in the price we charged mayne pharma 
if changes in foreign currency markets continue to cause a decrease in the price per gram we receive from mayne pharma  there could be a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow 
we currently record a reserve for potential mayne pharma pricing adjustments based upon historical experience and periodic reporting provided by mayne pharma 
our sales to jcr  if and when they occur  will be subject to the same risk
