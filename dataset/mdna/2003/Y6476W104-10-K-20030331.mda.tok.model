item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of omi corporation s omi or the company financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the information in this management discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this document contains certain forward looking statements  which reflect the current view of the company with respect to future events and financial performance 
wherever used  the words believes  estimates  expects  plan anticipates and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
any such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results of the company s results of operations to differ materially from historical results or current expectations 
the company does not publicly update its forward looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized 
general consolidated results omi s net income was million or basic and diluted earnings per share eps for the year ended december  compared to net income of million or basic and diluted eps for the year ended december  consistent with industry practice  we use time charter equivalent tce revenue voyage revenues less voyage expenses or tce rate calculations as a measure of analyzing fluctuations in voyage revenue between financial periods and as a method of equating revenue generated from a voyage charter to time charter revenue 
tce revenue also serves as an industry standard for measuring revenue and comparing results between geographical regions and among competitors 
a time charter involves the placing of a vessel at the charterer s disposal for a set period of time during which the charterer may use the vessel in return for the payment by the charterer of a specified daily or monthly hire rate 
under a voyage charter  the owner of a vessel agrees to provide the vessel for the transport of specific goods between specific ports in return for the payment of an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo or  alternatively  for a specified total amount 
all operating costs are for the owner s account 
the company earned tce revenues of million for the year ended december  tce revenue comprises time charter revenue tc revenue and voyage revenue less voyage expenses from vessels operating in the spot market 
tc revenue is revenue earned by vessels under contract for a specific period in time with duration usually greater than one year 
for the year ended december   percent or million of tce revenue was generated by time charters million by the clean fleet and million by the crude oil fleet and million was generated by voyage charters million by the clean fleet  million by the crude oil fleet 
our business strategy blends long term contract revenue at attractive rates with the ability to capture earnings upswings in rising spot markets with the suezmax tanker fleet  certain of our product carriers  panamaxes  ultra large crude carrier ulcc and from profit sharing arrangements for five of the product carriers on time charter 
currently  vessels of our vessels operate on time charters 
however  the majority of our tonnage  including all of our suezmaxes  operates in the spot market  giving us the ability to take advantage of increases in rates while protecting our downside 
five long term contracts have profit sharing arrangements long term contracts that have a floor rate and profit sharing without a cap 
in  three product carrier newbuildings will commence five year time charters with profit sharing arrangements upon delivery 
these profit sharing arrangements enable us to take advantage of upturns in the markets 
the contracted time charter revenue scheduled below does not include any profit sharing in the future periods for the vessels eligible for profit sharing  however  profit sharing of million earned by the five vessels for the year ended december  is included 
projected requirements for off hire relating to drydock are included 
the following reflects our contracted tc revenue through

note tc revenue is the amount contracted to date in the table above and does not include projections other than for expected delivery dates of newbuildings and offhire relating to drydock 
we intend to time charter the nine vessels  that expire beginning in at opportunistic times when attractive rates are available 
omi s fleet omi s fleet currently comprises vessels including two product carriers delivered in january and march aggregating approximately million dwt  consisting of suezmaxes  panamaxes carrying crude oil  handysize and handymax product carriers and a ulcc as follows number of vessels dwt crude oil fleet built suezmax vessels suezmax vessels chartered in built crude tankers s built panamax vessels built ulcc total crude oil fleet product carrier clean fleet built handymax product built handymax product chartered in built handysize product built handysize product total product carrier fleet during march  we agreed to sell two single hull product carriers with expected delivery dates of april and may our company objective is to operate a high quality  well maintained  modern fleet of vessels concentrated in the crude oil and product carrier markets 
large fleets of modern uniform sized vessels offer many advantages our customers prefer chartering modern vessels due to their increased sensitivities to environmental risks 
modern vessels are particularly important to customers entering into long term charters 
an increasing number of countries are excluding single hulled vessels from their ports and territorial waters  which increases demand for modern  double hulled vessels 
a young fleet has lower operating expenses 
younger  well maintained fleets generally have higher utilization 
maintaining a modern fleet is central to our strategy of seeking long term charters to provide cash flow stability 
in recent years while seeking to modernize and increase the size of our fleet  in addition to ordering vessels directly from the shipyard  we took opportunities to purchase rights from other shipowners to obtain vessels upon delivery from shipyards 
by doing so  we obtained earlier access to the vessels than we would have if we ordered them from the shipyards  and increased the size of our fleet without increasing the supply of tonnage 
omi has the following double hulled vessels under construction after the delivery of two handymax product carriers in january and march date to be charter name of vessel type of vessel delivered dwt expiration ottawa panamax tamar panamax loire handysize garonne handysize to be named handysize during march  five year time charters were negotiated with a major oil company 
during march  we exercised our option for this newbuilding 
activities during  the company completed the following transactions during september and october  we took delivery of two suezmax newbuildings 
during october  we chartered in a handymax product carrier for one year 
in june  we exercised our option to reacquire the columbia and simultaneously sold the vessel to an unrelated party for million 
the vessel  renamed oliver jacob  has been time chartered back for a period of eight years excluding options and has been accounted for as an operating lease 
the gain on the sale of approximately million is being amortized over the charter period 
in june  we agreed to time charter two panamax vessels to a major oil company for a period of five years from their delivery dates in in april  we sold a built product carrier for million and paid down related debt of million 
in january and march  we took delivery of three built product carriers two  dwt and one  dwt 
each vessel began a three year time charter upon delivery 
comparative versus vessel activities we have increased the size of our fleet from vessels at the beginning of to vessels at the end of there were acquisitions including vessels chartered in  which make up more than percent of the current fleet  and seven dispositions 
the net increase in operating days for the fleet was  of which  was an increase in operating days for the clean fleet and for the crude oil fleet for the year ended december  compared to the same period in date charter acquired delivered type type somjin jan

market overview suezmax tanker overview after a difficult tanker market in the first three quarters of  tces for crude carriers recovered sharply and average suezmax tanker tces in the fourth quarter were more than double those of the preceding quarter and higher than the same quarter a year ago 
freight rates in the crude tanker market have remained strong thus far in the crude tanker market improvement has been the result of higher world oil demand due to some improvement in world economic activity  colder than normal weather this winter at a time of very low oil inventory levels  problems in japan s nuclear power plants and a substantial increase in ton miles resulting from the substitution of long haul middle east opec production for loss of short haul venezuela oil production due to a general strike 
in addition  the tanker fleet increased by a relatively small amount of tonnage in at a time when the sinking of the old aframax tanker prestige off spain last october has resulted in increased demand for modern tonnage

note as at source clarkson research studies  london 
pira energy group the average opec crude oil production in the fourth quarter totaled about million barrels per day b d  down by million b d compared to the same period last year  as a result of the substantial reduction of oil production in venezuela due to a workers strike 
at the same time  the average crude oil output by the long haul middle east opec producers totaled million b d  up by million b d compared to the same time a year ago 
this was due to middle east opec member s effort to produce more oil to replace the lost venezuelan oil  alleviate the related effect of reduced venezuelan production on oil prices and prevent consuming countries from releasing strategic oil stocks 
the long haul opec countries have indicated that they will continue to produce more oil in the foreseeable future  affecting positively the demand for tankers  as oil production in venezuela is recovering slowly to its previous level of about million b d 
crude oil production in the united states of america totaled about million b d in and is expected to remain at about the same level in world oil demand in  for the third year in a row  increased marginally year on year due to slow world economic growth 
world oil demand is expected to increase by about million b d  or by in  mainly reflecting expected improvement in world economic activity and substitution of distillates for natural gas in north america due to the tight natural gas market 
at the end of february  estimated commercial crude oil inventories in the three major consuming areas the united states  western europe and japan were about million barrels or below year ago levels  and were at their lowest level in at least the last ten years with the entire decrease in the atlantic basin 

cxxjpg 
the world tanker fleet totaled million dwt at the end of  up by million dwt or from the year end level 
the tanker orderbook totaled million dwt  or of the existing fleet at the end of approximately million dwt are for delivery in  million dwt in and most of the balance in the tanker orderbook includes suezmaxes of about million dwt or of the existing internationally trading suezmax tanker fleet 
at the end of approximately million dwt or of the total tanker fleet was or more years old  including million dwt or of the fleet which was or more years old 
furthermore  suezmaxes were or more years old  including which were or more years old 
as a result of the low tanker freight environment through early october  tanker sales for scrap and for floating production storage offloading conversion for the year were relatively high reaching about million dwt 
high freight rates thus far in have reduced sales of tankers for scrap and fpso conversion to about million dwt  including three suezmaxes and three vlccs 
however  tanker scrappings are likely to be high in the next few years given the age profile of the tanker fleet and stricter regulations 
as a result of the recent sinking off spain of the year old aframax tanker prestige and the extensive pollution of a substantial portion of the spanish coast  the commission of the european communities the commission has urged its member states to ban from european ports single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil  heavy crude oil  bitumen and tar 
furthermore  the commission has proposed measures which would accelerate the phase out of single hull tankers  prior to the timetable set forth in the april imo regulation 
at the end of  there were million dwt single hull tankers or of the total tanker fleet  which would be affected if the proposed accelerated phase out measures are adopted 
finally  the commission has proposed that all single hull tankers shall comply with the condition assessment scheme cas from the age of years  beginning in the cas will be carried out every two and a half years through stringent inspections specifically developed to detect structural weaknesses of tankers 
the commission has urged its member states to approve these measures by the end of march and adopt them early in the summer this year 
product tanker overview the product tanker market weakness which began more than a year ago continued through october  when tces for handysize product tankers in the caribbean fell to the lowest level in the last three years 
this was due to slow world economic growth resulting in fewer cargo movements 
tces for product tankers increased in the last two months of and thus far in mainly due to colder than normal winter and increased movements of heating oil as well as the need to replace short haul product imports to the united states with long haul imports due to political problems in venezuela 
the world product tanker fleet totaled about million dwt at the end of  up by about from year end level 
the product tanker orderbook totals about million dwt  or about of the existing product tanker fleet at the end of approximately million dwt are for delivery in  million dwt in and most of the balance in at the end of  million dwt or of the existing fleet is or more years old 
it is likely that the product tanker fleet will grow substantially  given the high orderbook for delivery in the next two years  unless scrappings accelerate 
at the end of february  total estimated commercial inventories for all oil products in the united states  western europe and japan were million barrels or lower than the same time a year ago  with distillates down by and gasoline down by 
this has been the result of the cold winter in the northern hemisphere  high refinery maintenance in the united states in the first quarter and very tight north american natural gas markets which have resulted in substitution of distillates for natural gas 

cxxjpg 
with low gasoline stocks in the atlantic basin and seasonal gasoline demand gains as the driving season approaches  the gasoline market is expected to support the product tanker market in the foreseeable future 
in the longer term  improvement in world economic activity  the shortage of refinery capacity in north america  western europe and asia and expansion of refinery capacity in the middle east and latin america should increase demand for product tankers 
the tanker market is expected to be good for shipowners in the short term as a result of higher oil production by the long haul middle east opec producers to offset the loss of short haul venezuelan oil production  low crude oil and petroleum products inventories  and from uncertainty in the oil markets due to increased political instability in the middle east 
for the balance of  given the high tanker orderbook for delivery this year  the level of tanker rates will depend on the level of world economic activity and oil demand growth as well as tanker scrappings 
critical accounting estimates the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding omi s financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include revenue expense recognition for voyage charters  vessel impairments  depreciation expense  drydock amortization  and carrying value of investments 
below  we discuss these estimates further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policy for revenue recognition for profit sharing for time charters  however  this policy does not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because it does not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
the following policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by omi s audit committee 
revenue recognition revenue generated by voyage charters net of voyage expenses for the year ended december   was of our consolidated tce revenues 
when spot rates are higher  which they have been historically  more than of consolidated tce revenues may be generated by voyage charters 
under a voyage charter  the owner of a vessel agrees to provide the vessel for the transport of specific goods between specific ports in return for the payment of an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo or  alternatively  for a specified total amount 
all operating costs are for the owner s account 
voyage expenses  such as fuel and port charges  are recognized ratably over the duration of the voyage 
omi recognizes voyage revenues and voyage expenses on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method is the most prevalent method of accounting for voyage revenues and expenses 
estimated losses under a voyage charter are provided for in full at the time such losses become evident 
vessels in the spot market may also spend time idle or laid up as they await business 
revenue recognition for voyage charters may be calculated on either a load to load basis or on a discharge to discharge basis 
as of january  omi s accounting policy for recognition of voyage freight for vessels operating on voyage charters is on the discharge to discharge basis 
under this method  voyage revenue is recognized evenly over the period from the departure of a vessel from its prior discharge port to departure from the next discharge port 
management believes that the discharge to discharge method is preferable because it eliminates the uncertainty associated with the location of the next load port 
the method is the predominant one used by shipowners 
management uses judgment to estimate the number of days to the vessels next discharge port to compute the amount of revenue and expense to recognize for voyages in progress at the end of each month using the percentage of completion method on a discharge to discharge basis 
management uses assumptions to determine these estimates that are supported by historical trends  more specifically about the operating capacity of the vessel speed and fuel consumption and about the trading route and port 
actual results could differ from accruals that are included in the consolidated balance sheets as traffic receivables  prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued voyage and vessel liabilities  and as  revenues and voyage expense categories included in the consolidated statements of income that are estimates in a period 
vessel impairments and depreciation expense vessels and construction in progress cip payments are recorded at cost 
expenditures for maintenance  repairs and minor renewals are expensed 
major replacements and renewals are capitalized 
at december   the company s carrying amount of vessels and cip was million 
the carrying values of the company s vessels and cips may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings 
management reviews vessels for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that their value may have declined 
in order to evaluate impairment of the vessels  assumptions about the future condition of the vessel and its operations are made 
these assumptions are applied in a model in which we estimate the projected future cash flows associated with the vessel and comparisons to the vessel s carrying value to determine if a write down to fair value is required 
this evaluation process involves subjective assumptions about future events and discount factors to be applied to projected cash flows 
estimated values can be affected by many factors beyond the company s control such as the overall market and economic trends  government regulation  and other changes 
management believes that the assumptions made to evaluate the vessels impairment are appropriate and reasonable 
however  changes in circumstances or conditions affecting these assumptions could result in impairment charges in future periods that may be material 
salvage value is based upon a vessel s lightweight tonnage lwt multiplied by a scrap rate 
omi uses a scrap rate of per lwt to compute each vessel s salvage value 
the estimated scrap value is used in the computation of depreciation expense and recoverability of the carrying value of each vessel when evaluating for impairment of vessels 
management s estimates for salvage values may differ from actual results 
depreciation for financial reporting purposes is provided on the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets up to the assets estimated salvage value 
we estimate the useful lives of the vessels to range from to years 
in the shipping industry  use of a year life has become the standard 
management s judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate the annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation 
it is anticipated that the commission will require stricter requirements for single hull vessels that could result in accelerated depreciation expense for three of omi s older vessels 
if such proposals were enacted into law in  omi may be required to record additional expense of approximately million reducing eps by in drydock amortization drydock costs and special surveys are capitalized and are amortized over the period between drydocks and special surveys  which is generally a two to three year period 
the drydock amortization expense was million in and is included in depreciation and amortization expense 
in  the company changed its method of accounting for special survey and drydock expenses from the accrual method to the prepaid method 
special survey and drydock expenses had been accrued and charged to operating expenses over the vessel s survey cycle 
under the prepaid method  survey and drydock expenses are capitalized and amortized over two to three year period until the next cycle 
management believes the prepaid method better matches costs with revenues and minimizes any significant changes in estimates associated with the accrual method  including the disposal of a vessel before a drydock  which has been accrued for  is performed 
management uses judgment when estimating the period between drydocks or surveys performed  which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock expense 
if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock  the remaining balance in prepaid drydock is written off to gain loss on disposal of vessels in the period when contracted 
impairment of investments in equity securities we had investments in equity securities currently in two companies  one of which was publicly traded on a foreign exchange 
we reviewed these investments and others previously that have been disposed of  each quarter to evaluate our ability to recover our investments 
we record an impairment charge if the fair value of the investment has declined below our carrying value  and that decline is viewed to be other than temporary 
for publicly traded companies  the fair value of the equity securities is determined by multiplying the number of shares we own by the stock price 
for companies that are not publicly traded  we prepare discounted cash flow analyses to compute an estimate of the fair value of the investment 
since we generally do not have access to internal projections of those companies  we prepare projections based on information that is publicly available 
we use judgment in computing the fair value based on our evaluation of the investee and establishing an appropriate discount rate and terminal value to apply in the calculations 
in selecting these and other assumptions  we consider the investee s ability to execute their business plan successfully  including their ability to obtain required funding  general market conditions  and industry considerations specific to their business 
it is likely that we could compute a materially different fair value for an investment if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change 
during  as part of the ongoing evaluation of our ability to recover our investments  we calculated the current fair value based on the publicly traded stock price for one company  considered the other public information available and assessed the business plan of the other investment not publicly traded 
we then made an assessment as to whether the decline in the value of these investments was other than temporary 
we also assessed future business prospects for the companies and reviewed information regarding market and industry trends for their businesses 
we concluded  based on our assumptions and best judgments an impairment charge was required and we recorded a loss on such investments of million 
results of operations results of operations include operating activities of our vessels 
the following discussion explains our vessel operating results by fleet in terms of tce revenue  defined previously  less vessel expenses  charter hire expense and depreciation and amortization expense 
in recent years  omi has been securing certain vessels on long term time charter contracts 
currently  of omi s vessels are performing on time charters greater than one year 
this represents half of the operating days of the fleet 
the crude oil fleet  however  operates primarily in the spot market  with the exception of two crude oil carriers acquired in june with time charters 
in the discussion that follows  total operating days are net of offhire days  which are any days that the vessel is not generating revenue due to drydock  special surveys  repairs and initial positioning of the vessel 
vessel expenses include operating expenses such as crew wages and other related costs  stores  routine maintenance and repairs  insurance and miscellaneous 
these expenses are a function of the fleet size  utilization levels for certain expenses  requirements under laws  and by charterer and our standards 
insurance expense varies with overall insurance market conditions as well as the insured s loss record  level of insurance and desired coverage 
we locked in rates with modest increases for most of our hull and machinery coverage ie  asset insurance  and protection and indemnity coverage liability insurance provided by p i clubs with multi year contracts in  which also cover the new vessels that we have on order 
however  one of omi s p i clubs  which is a mutual indemnity provider  assessed its members additional amounts for several past years due to their current financial needs resulting from the current poor investment markets and an increased level of claims 
certain other insurances  such as war risk  a portion of which are passed on to charterers  also increased 
as a result insurance expense increased in compared to omi s vessels are technically managed excluding insurance provided for vessels  which is managed directly by omi by a wholly owned subsidiary  omi marine services llc oms  located at offices in stamford  connecticut and houston  texas 
oms subcontracts several of the day to day operations to omi crewing services ltd 
omci  located in mumbai  india not a related party to omi or any of its subsidiaries 
omci is primarily responsible for the crewing  general maintenance and repairs  and the stocking of supplies on vessels 
under the direction of oms  omci purchases stores and spares for all vessels that they manage omci manages all of omi s owned vessels with the exception of the two handysize crude oil tankers 
oms is also responsible for the drydocking of the vessels  including scheduling the drydocks and obtaining bids 
omi is kept apprised of all drydocking schedules and approves all related costs 
omi advances funds to omci for expenditures including crew wages  benefits  training  crew travel and airfare  salary  office and other expense of the technical staff of omci  allotments  union payments  and other expenditures covered under the process of advances to masters which includes cash reserve on board  cash for bonded stores and provisions purchases and other items 
for the year ended december  versus december  results of operations of our vessels tce revenue of million for the year ended december  decreased by million  from million in vessel expenses and charter hire expenses increased an aggregate of million and depreciation and amortization increased million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended decreases in tce revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  were attributed primarily to decreases in a the suezmax fleet by million and panamax fleet by million resulting from a significant decline in rates during compared to rates began to decline during the second half of and continued throughout most of toward the end of the fourth quarter of  rates began to improve again 
additionally  although there were eight suezmax vessels at december  compared to six at december   there were fewer operating days in compared to there were more operating days in aggregate for the vessels sold or redelivered in than there were in for the vessels delivered in the second half of the year 
b the product carriers operating in the spot market which declined by million because of lower rates earned by the older single hull vessels during compared to coupled with fewer operating days in fewer days due to the sale of a vessel earlier in  fewer days due to a vessel that went on a time charter in mid  more offhire days for drydock in offset by days for the vessel chartered in october and days for the second hand vessels delivered during february and march 
c the ulcc tce revenues by million because of unemployment of the vessel for a significant portion of the year and a decline in spot rates for most of compared to during october  the vessel began a profitable time charter that currently expires in april decreases in tce revenue during the year ended december  were partially offset by increases of million from product carriers operating on time charters for  more operating days in three vessels were acquired in more days in  and there were  more days in attributed to seven vessels acquired during and more days for a vessel previously operating in the spot market in which began a time charter mid year additionally  tce revenue increased by million for the two handysize crude oil carriers acquired in june  which operated for more days during vessel expenses and charter hire expense increased million for the twelve months ended december  vessel expenses increased approximately million primarily from additional vessel costs for the vessels acquired and increased charter hire expense of million during compared to for two vessels chartered in  one in december  and the other in october depreciation and amortization expense increased million for the year ended december  because of the acquisition of vessels and increased amortization for drydock expense for drydocks performed in and other operating expenses the company s operating expenses  other than voyage  vessel  charter hire and depreciation and amortization  consist of g a expenses and loss gain on disposal write down of assets net 
for the year ended december   other operating expenses increased by million primarily from gains on disposals of million in versus a loss on disposals in of million  in addition to million increase in g a expense in the loss gain on disposal write down of assets net for the year ended december  of million was primarily from the sale of a product carrier in april the gain on disposal in of million resulted from the sale of two vessels 
the sale of a suezmax vessel resulted in a gain of million while the sale of a product carrier resulted in a gain of million 
there was also a gain of million from the early termination of two time charters 
other expense income other expense income consists of loss on disposal write down of investments  interest expense  interest income and other net 
net other expense increased by million from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  loss on disposal write down of investments of million for the year ended december  related primarily to the write down of two investments aggregating approximately million offset partially by the gain from the sale of a marketable security 
loss on disposal write down of investments was approximately million for the year ended december  the loss relates to the reserve for a loss on investment during the winding down of a joint venture 
interest expense of million for the year ended december   increased million from million for the year ended december  the net increase was primarily due to interest expense on the financing for vessel acquisitions 
the average outstanding debt in was higher than due to additional borrowings for acquisitions which exceeded repayments from the disposal of vessels 
interest income of million for the year ended december   decreased million from million for the year ended december  because average cash balances were lower in compared to  interest rates were lower  and the balances in interest earning long term notes receivable were less in other net decreased million for the year ended december  the balance in was primarily the result of insurance settlements of claims on various vessels during the year ended december  income tax benefit the income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  represents a reversal of an accrual for taxes provided for at the time of the spin off in all tax years through the time of the spin off of the company in have been closed 
omi is a marshall islands corporation 
pursuant to various tax treaties and the current united states internal revenue code  the company s international shipping income prospectively is not subject to federal income taxes in the united states of america 
equity in operations of joint ventures equity in operations of joint ventures decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the reduction was from the winding down of a joint venture in prior years 
detailed operating results by market segments the following discussion details the results of our vessels operations by our two segments  the crude oil tanker fleet and product carrier fleet 
vessel operating income by segment is defined as  tce revenue less vessel expenses  charter hire expense and depreciation and amortization expense 
crude oil tanker fleet breakdown by fleet for the years ended december  in thousands  except daily rates expenses  number of vessels and operating days suezmaxes tce revenue vessel expenses charter hire expense depreciation and amortization vessel operating income average daily tce spot average daily tce time charter out average daily operating expense number of vessels owned end of period number of vessels chartered in end of period number of operating days spot number of operating days time charter out ulcc tce revenue vessel expenses depreciation and amortization vessel operating loss income average daily tce average daily operating expense number of vessels owned end of period number of operating days panamaxes tce revenue vessel expenses depreciation and amortization vessel operating income average daily tce average daily operating expense number of vessels owned end of period number of operating days handysize product carriers on time charter tce revenue vessel expenses depreciation and amortization vessel operating income average daily tce average daily operating expense number of vessels owned end of period number of operating days total crude fleet vessel operating income note average daily operating expenses are computed using the number of days in the period which omi owned or bareboat chartered the vessel 
number of operating days used to compute average daily tce includes waiting days and is reduced only for the days the vessels are in drydock 
in september and october  two suezmax newbuildings were delivered 
in june  a suezmax vessel was sold 
during january  a suezmax newbuilding was delivered 
in december  a vessel was sold and leased back 
in january and march  omi redelivered two chartered in vessels 
in june  two handysize crude oil tankers were acquired with time charters 
fluctuations in each of the crude oil tanker groups were as follows suezmaxes the decrease in vessel operating income of million and million in tce revenues for this group was primarily the result of declines in charter rates for suezmaxes see market overview coupled with waiting slow steaming days and less operating days during due to the sale of a suezmax vessel in june and vessels redelivered in charter hire expense increased million for the year ended december  related to the sale and leaseback of two vessels  one in december and one in june subsequent to the sale of vessels  vessel expense and depreciation expense declined in the suezmax fleet 
depreciation and amortization increased for the two vessels acquired in the second half of ulcc the decrease of million in vessel operating income and million in tce revenues resulted from a decline in charter rates coupled with the unemployment of the ulcc vessel for a significant part of the year

during  omi recognized profit sharing of approximately million for the year ended december  during  seven handysize product carriers were acquired 
in january and march  two handymax product carriers and one handysize product carrier were acquired 
a vessel operating on spot during the first quarter began a time charter in july fluctuations in each of the product carrier groups were as follows products on spot this group had a decrease of million in vessel operating income  consisting of a decrease of million in tce revenues and a million decrease in vessel expenses 
decreases in revenues resulted from the sale of one vessel and the decline in spot rates for these single hull vessels in products on time charter vessel operating income increased million tce revenues increased million and vessel expenses increased million which was attributable to the acquisition of ten vessels seven in and three in  all of which began time charters upon delivery  coupled with increased profit sharing earned in by five vessels  three of which were acquired in vessel expenses and depreciation expense also increased as a result of the acquisition of vessels 
the five vessels with long term time charters have flat time charter rates with profit sharing agreements profit sharing above the flat rate 
for the year ended december  an aggregate of million in profit sharing was recognized 
balance sheet during the year ended december   omi sold marketable securities and received net proceeds of approximately million 
the sales resulted in a net gain of million 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss was increased by million to reflect the fair value of interest rate swaps and future rate agreements fras to million see financing activities 
during the year ended december   changes in vessels and other property net were as follows vessels and other property increased a net of million  construction in progress decreased a net of million accumulated depreciation increased a net of million from the balances at december  depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  was million including million for amortization of drydock expense 
during january  march  september and october  omi took delivery of five vessels  two new handymax product carriers  one handysize product carrier and two suezmax vessels which resulted in the following fluctuations 
vessels increased an aggregate of million for the capitalized costs of the five vessels  million was reclassified from construction in progress  million cash was paid to the respective shipyards in related to these capitalized costs 
million of the payments were financed during the year ended december  see cash flow section and financing activities 
increases to vessels and other property were partially offset by the sale of the product carrier in april  decreasing vessels by million and accumulated depreciation decreased by million 
additionally  a charge was recorded to reflect the loss on disposal of the vessel of million 
other increases  not including vessels delivered in  in construction in progress of million  during the year ended december  related to vessels to be delivered in and in june  the company exercised its option to reacquire the columbia using approximately million in cash  million of cash in an escrow account and million of proceeds from an associated note receivable and simultaneously sold the vessel to an unrelated party for million 
the vessel  renamed oliver jacob  has been time chartered back for a period of eight years plus two years at either party s option and has been accounted for as an operating lease 
the gain on the sale of approximately million will be amortized over the charter period of eight years 
the company used million of the sales proceeds to pay down a line of credit 
during december  we issued million shares of common stock pursuant to an equity agreement 
net proceeds received were approximately million 
capital expenditures drydocks we anticipate drydocking approximately vessels in for an estimated aggregate cost of million and will incur approximately off hire days

payments in the first quarter relating to the two vessels delivered and one construction installment payment were approximately million 
construction payments for the remainder of and will be million and million  respectively 
as of december   financing of million had been arranged for construction payments 
the two panamax vessels scheduled to be delivered in can also carry both clean and crude oil products 
they will begin five year time charters upon delivery 
during march and january  and december  we ordered three  dwt product carriers to be delivered in april  july and october the vessels will begin five year time charters upon delivery 
when appropriate  we may also look to make other strategic vessel acquisitions 
the delivery of vessels on order and potential acquisitions of vessels may be funded by operating cash  issuance of stock  debt financing  and proceeds from the disposal of vessels 
in march  omi agreed to sell two of its built single hull product carriers for an aggregate of approximately million 
the sale will result in a loss of approximately million in the first quarter currently  the vessels are scheduled to be delivered in april and may for the year ended december  versus december  results of operations of our vessels net income was million or basic and diluted eps for the year ended december  compared to net income of million or basic and diluted eps for the year ended december  tce revenues of million for the year ended december  increased by million from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   vessel expenses increased million and charter hire expense decreased million 
the net increase in our results in were primarily due to additional earnings from the acquisition of vessels  which were offset by a decline in earnings in the suezmax and panamax fleets 
the following were changes in the composition of omi s fleet from january  to december  that are reflected in operating results for the periods reported sold four handysize product carriers  three in may and one in august acquired two suezmax newbuildings in march and may acquired a joint venture partners share of a ulcc vessel previously owned percent in june acquired two handymax product carriers in september and november originally time chartered until  extended until during

acquired three handysize product tankers in october  november and december two have been time chartered for three years and one for five years 
sold a suezmax vessel in december  which is being chartered back from the purchaser for a period of five years not including options for a gain of approximately million 
the gain is being amortized over the five year term of the charter 
the net increase in tce revenue  operating expenses and depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  over the comparable period in was attributable primarily to increases in the product carrier fleet due to higher daily tce rates for the vessels in the spot market and the acquisition of nine vessels since september that operated on time charters 
increases in earnings in the crude oil fleet were due to an increase in the average tce revenue for panamax vessels earnings in for three suezmaxes  two delivered during the second quarter and one in january revenue earned by the ulcc purchased by omi on june  and increased earnings from two handysize crude oil carriers acquired in june that are continuing on long term time charters until mid  not including options 
the net increase in tce revenue was offset in part by decreases due to a decline in charter rates coupled with increased waiting days for suezmax and ulcc vessels  fewer operating days due to the early termination of two vessels chartered in and redelivered during the first quarter and an additional offhire days related to drydock in compared to depreciation and amortization increased million due to depreciation not being recorded for the five vessels classified as vessels to be disposed of in and the acquisition of sixteen new vessels since april other operating expenses the company s operating expenses  other than vessel  voyage and charter hire expenses  depreciation and amortization  consists of g a expenses and loss gain on disposal write down of assets net 
for the year ended december   these expenses decreased by million primarily from the decrease in loss gain on disposal of assets net which was a loss of million for the year ended compared to a gain of million for the year ended general administrative g a increased million due to an increase in expenses  as a result of a larger fleet 
loss gain on disposal write down of assets net the loss gain on disposal write down of assets net  changed by million from a loss of million for the year ended december  to a gain of million in the gain on disposal in of million resulted from the sale of two vessels 
the sale of a suezmax vessel resulted in a gain of million while the sale of a product carrier resulted in a gain of million 
there was also a gain of million from the early termination of two time charters 
the loss on disposal write down of assets in of million relates to the disposals of four vessels and the write down of two vessels in adjustments for three vessels previously classified as assets to be disposed of at december  resulted in additional losses on the sale dates aggregating million 
two similar vessels net realizable values  which were also classified as assets to be disposed of at december   were adjusted during the first quarter by an aggregate of million 
a vessel sold in may resulted in a loss on disposal of million 
losses in were offset in part by the gain recorded of million from the early termination of two time charters  one part of this gain was from the accelerated amortization of the provision for loss on a lease obligation 
the gain on early termination of the second charter resulted from accelerated amortization on the deferred gain 
other expense income other expense income consists of loss on disposal write down of investments  interest expense  interest income and other net 
net other expense decreased by million from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  loss on disposal write down of investments was approximately million for the year ended december  the loss relates to the reserve for a loss on investment during the winding down of the ipc joint venture 
the loss on disposal of investments of approximately million resulted from the sale of a joint venture and the write down of a long term investment 
interest expense decreased million for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  the decrease is due to reduced interest margin  increased capitalized interest related to the construction of newbuildings and reduced libor  offset by financing for vessel acquisitions 
other net of million primarily represents insurance settlements of claims on various vessels during the year ended december  during the same period in an aggregate of approximately million for insurance settlements was recorded 
equity in operations of joint ventures equity in operations of joint ventures decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the reduction was from the winding down of the joint ventures in prior years 
detailed operating results by market segments the following discussion details the results of our vessels operations by our two segments in terms of vessel operating income  as defined  for the crude oil tanker fleet and product carrier fleet segments 
crude oil tanker fleet at december   we operated crude carriers  including two chartered in suezmax vessels 
in we took delivery of a suezmax newbuilding  which began its first voyage in january  sold a suezmax vessel in june which we took delivery of in march and entered into a sale lease back agreement for a suezmax vessel in december  which was delivered in may in  we sold an aframax vessel in march  took delivery of a suezmax newbuilding  which began its first voyage in early april  took delivery of another new suezmax vessel in may which began its first voyage in early june and acquired one ulcc vessel  which was purchased in june from our joint venture partner the company previously owned percent

during  two panamax vessels were in drydock for days days in the third quarter and days in the fourth quarter 
in june  two handysize crude oil tankers were acquired with time charters 
in march  an aframax vessel was delivered to new owners 
fluctuations in each of the crude oil fleet vessel types were as follows suezmaxes the decrease in vessel operating income of million and million in tce revenues for this group was the largest impact on the crude fleet 
included in this group is a decrease due to the early termination during the first quarter of two vessels chartered in 
a decrease in revenues and expenses was attributable to the sale of one vessel in june other decreases were due to a decline in charter rates coupled with increased waiting days  offset by the delivery of one vessel in january ulcc the increase of million in tce revenues and increase in operating expenses of million resulted from more operating days in compared to the vessel was acquired june 
additional expenses relating to the vessel drydock and amortization of drydock included with depreciation and amortization are reflected in the expenses 
panamaxes the decrease of million in tce revenues is attributable to fewer operating days in due to an additional off hire days for drydock in comparison to year ended other crude the increase of million in tce revenues  million increase in operating expenses and million increase in depreciation expense is from the two built crude oil carriers that were delivered in june the increases are net of expenses relating to the s built aframax vessel sold in march product carrier fleet at december   we owned product carriers  seven handysize vessels on the spot market and twelve handymax and handysize vessels on time charter 
during  we acquired three second hand handysize product carriers in february and march  sold one product carrier in may that was purchased in march  acquired three handysize product tankers in september  acquired three handysize product tankers in october  november and december and reacquired six vessels from the ipc pool during march and april into our fleet management

during february and march three vessels were acquired two built in and one in  one was sold may one vessel was sold in august  and three vessels were sold in the second quarter during  seven handysize product carriers were acquired one in april  october  november and december and three in september 
the results include two handymax vessels delivered on september  and november  fluctuations in each of the product carrier groups were as follows products on spot this group had an increase of million in tce revenues and million in operating expenses 
increases in revenues associated with the purchase of vessels in were offset by decreases from the sale of vessels in other increases in revenue were attributable to higher spot market rates  offset by fewer operating days due to drydock 
products on time charter the increase of million in tce revenues and million in operating expenses were attributable to the purchase of seven vessels in and two vessels in liquidity and capital resources cash flows cash and cash equivalents of million at december  increased million from cash and cash equivalents of million at december  the company s working capital increased by million between december  and december   and was million at december  at december   we had time charters under which we receive one month s advance charter hire at the start of each month  which increased the working capital at the beginning of january at december   current assets increased million and current liabilities decreased million 
cash increased primarily because of proceeds from the issuance of debt and the sale of two vessels and marketable securities  which exceeded the payments to acquire vessels 
increases in current assets were offset partially by decreases in current restricted cash  primarily from the return of escrow million as a result of the purchase of the columbia in june current liabilities decreased primarily from the decrease in the current portion of long term debt 
the current portion of debt was reduced by million  to million at december   upon the refinancing of debt in march see financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  see results of operations 
during the year ended december   we took various steps to improve our liquidity  and as a result ended the year with a cash balance of million 
in addition  at december   the company had million available under lines of credit and our net debt which is total debt less cash and cash equivalents to net capitalization which is total debt plus stockholders equity less cash and cash equivalents ratio was percent 
the company s management believes that cash flow from operations  along with available borrowing capacity under its credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements 
cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash used by investing activities of million for the year ended december  during  million was used for additions to vessels as follows million was used for the purchase of three product carriers and two suezmax vessels  million for the purchase of the columbia  million was used to paid for vessels under construction  and million was used for capital expenditures for improvements to existing vessels and capitalized interest cash was used during the year ended december  primarily for additions to vessels of million as follows million in cash used to purchase thirteen vessels  million for two new suezmax newbuilding contracts  million installment payments for seven vessels under construction  and million for capital expenditures for improvements to existing vessels and capitalized interest during the year ended december   we sold and leased back a suezmax vessel  sold a product carrier proceeds from dispositions aggregated million  secured additional lines of credit  and reduced amortization on existing lines giving us flexibility to withstand weak tanker markets and improve liquidity 
proceeds of million received for the disposal of vessels during the year ended december   were for two suezmax vessels sold in june and december and a product carrier sold in may adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is presented to provide additional information with respect to the company s ability to satisfy debt service  capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
while adjusted ebitda is frequently used as a measure of operating results and the ability to meet debt service requirements  it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculations 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income or other measurements under generally accepted accounting principles 
adjusted ebitda of million for the year ended december  was million less than the million for the year ended december  the decrease in was due to the decline in tanker rates  but primarily due to the decreased rates earned by the suezmax fleet in compared to the following table is a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda

newly issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued statements  which are summarized as follows sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was issued in october sfas replaces fasb statement  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
sfas also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after december  and are to be applied prospectively 
the company did not have discontinued operations as of december  and the adoption of this statement had no impact on the financial statements 
sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections was issued in april the statement updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
sfas rescinds statement  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
as a result  the criteria in apb opinion will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
statement amended statement  and is no longer necessary because statement has been rescinded 
statement was issued to establish accounting requirements for the effects of transition to the provisions of the motor carrier act of because the transition has been completed  statement is no longer necessary 
sfas amends statement to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also makes technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
while those corrections are not substantive in nature  in some instances  they may change accounting practices 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  since this new statement was issued to clarify and simplify existing pronouncements there is no effect on the company s financial statements 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities was issued in june sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred  as opposed to when the entity commits to an exit plan under eitf issue no

in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation fin  which elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
fin does not apply to certain guarantee contracts  such as those issued by insurance companies or for a lessee s residual value guarantee embedded in a capital lease 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations would not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   regardless of the guarantor s fiscal year end

in january  the fasb issued fin  which addresses financial reporting requirements for variable interest entities  also referred to as special purpose entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights  or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property and may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established
