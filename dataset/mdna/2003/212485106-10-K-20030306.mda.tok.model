volumes under certain of the company s long term contracts are subject to variation based  among other things  on the clients spending on outsourced customer support and subscriber levels 

table of contents the company s information contract with sprint pcs runs through  but contains provisions for extension 
although the company continues to have discussions with sprint pcs regarding extension of the contract  no agreement has been reached to date 
business outlook current economic factors may have a significant impact on the company s future period results  for example the continuing slowness of the global economy  lower spending by telecom carriers  slowing subscriber growth by leading wireless carriers  loss of clients  and limited new marketing spending by carriers 
additionally  because of the recent slowdown in the wireless communications business and increasing competition within our industry  the trend of granting subscriber rate reductions in exchange for extensions of existing contractual relationships may continue  resulting in a negative near term impact on the company s revenue  operating income and cash flows 
furthermore  as discussed more fully under the heading critical accounting policies deferred charges  the trend of paying cash signing bonuses in exchange for acquisition or extension of contractual relationships may continue 
the company  as most other companies  will also see increased costs for wages and benefits  including pension and health care 
if these trends continue  the company will continue to be challenged to maintain or increase its revenue base and manage effectively its cost structure 
as is evident with the restructuring plan  which is discussed more fully under the heading special items  the company is responding to these trends from a cost perspective 
although these restructuring initiatives should partially offset some of the margin pressures caused by the reduction in revenue and increases in pension  health care  and other costs  they will not fully offset these negative trends 
accordingly  img revenues could decline during by to percent from levels  and operating margin could decline to percent  cmg revenues could increase to percent from the level  and operating margin could increase to percent 
despite img s recent negative revenue trend  the company believes that the long term outlook for billing information systems and services is positive 
based on estimates from gartner dataquest  a leading industry analysis company  the market for billing information systems and services is estimated to grow annually over the next three years 
img would benefit from this growth from existing wireless clients 
in addition  to offset subcriber rate reductions  img must increase its volume with existing clients through delivery of new services and products 
also  img must capture new wireless clients  both domestically and internationally  representing service providers that will outgrow their current billing systems and be in the market for more advanced billing systems  which will enable them to bill for the broad range of wireless and other services that will be necessary for these service providers to compete 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources free cash flows cash flows from operations a change in securitization capital expenditures free cash flows net debt b a includes the impacts of the accounts receivable securitization 
b defined as outstanding debt plus net accounts receivable securitization proceeds less cash and cash equivalents 
operating cash flows historically have been more than sufficient to fund the company s cash needs  other than for large acquisitions 
with the exception of the geneva transaction  acquisitions historically have been financed with a combination of borrowings and operating cash flows 
the company s free cash flows totaled in  compared to in and in the company s borrowing facilities include a credit facility with in borrowing capacity that expires in july and a commercial paper program backed by this credit facility 
the company also has a accounts receivable securitization agreement  under which it had sold in accounts receivable at december  the accounts receivable securitization agreement expires in september the company anticipates that future operating cash flows  its available credit under existing facilities and its access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet future capital needs 
pursuant to authorization by the company s board of directors  the company repurchased million of its common shares during for total costs of in february  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of the company s common shares 
the company is a party to a financing transaction related to its office complex in orlando  florida 
under the terms of the financing transaction  which was structured as a synthetic lease  a special purpose entity trust owns the office complex and leases it to the company 
the trust serves as a conduit between an unrelated commercial lender and the company and the only substantive purpose is to lease the office complex to the company 
the company has not made any equity investments in the trust  nor has it provided any financing to the trust  and it does not control the operations of the trust 
furthermore  no company employee or director has any ownership interest in the trust 
the owner of record of the trust has made an initial substantive residual equity capital investment that has been at risk during the entire term of the lease 

table of contents the lease had an initial term of three years  with two one year renewal options 
as the initial term expired at the end of  the company exercised the first one year renewal option and in december  the company elected to exercise the second one year renewal option 
as of december   the assets and liabilities of the trust were comprised primarily of the office complex and bank debt used to fund the construction of the office complex 
the company s lease payment includes a variable interest component  but the company effectively has converted the variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate of through an interest rate swap with a nominal value of in connection with this transaction  the company has made a residual value guarantee for the leased property equal to of the financing  or the company believes the fair market value of the leased property is greater than the company s guaranteed residual value 
at the end of the lease term  the company has the option to purchase the property from the lessor for or the lessor will sell the property 
the company believes it has sufficient sources of capital to purchase the property if that is the company s decision 
the company currently is evaluating whether to purchase the property or enter into a new lease agreement 
the company expects to make its decision during the middle of in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  which changes the criteria currently used by companies in deciding whether it is required to consolidate another entity 
the company is evaluating what impact  if any  interpretation no 
will have on the current accounting treatment of the trust 
if it is determined that consolidation of the trust is required  the assets and liabilities of the trust will be included in the consolidated financial statements of the company beginning july  the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods contractual obligation total less than year years after years debt operating leases total accounts receivable adjusting for acquisitions and a increase in the balance of receivables sold under the company s accounts receivable securitization program  accounts receivable increased from december  to december   excluding the effect of acquisitions 
excluding the effects of the securitization  days sales outstanding increased by days during to days reflecting slower payment at the end of by some of the company s larger clients 
days sales outstanding is computed as follows receivables  net of allowances  plus outstanding receivables sold under securitization divided by average days sales 
average days sales is defined as consolidated revenues for the quarter just ended divided by the number of calendar days in the quarter just ended 
critical accounting policies goodwill at december   the company had goodwill with a net carrying value of as disclosed in note of notes to financial statements  the company adopted new accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets  which required an initial and annual periodic evaluation of impairment 
impairment tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the business operations 

table of contents during  the company completed its initial and annual impairment tests  which indicated that the company had no goodwill impairment 
deferred tax assets as of december   the company had operating and capital loss tax carryforwards of with a related tax benefit of for those tax carryforwards  where the company has concluded that it is more likely than not that these loss carryforwards will not be utilized  the company has provided a valuation allowance which amounted to as of december  including the tax loss carryforwards and the related valuation allowance  the company had a net deferred tax asset of based on the company s estimates of future taxable income  which were based on the same assumptions and projections utilized in the company s long term plans  and the short term nature of many of the deferred tax assets included in the net deferred tax asset  the company believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
deferred charges as of december   the carrying value of deferred charges was in connection with certain of the company s outsourcing arrangements  the company from time to time will incur direct and incremental costs  consisting principally of non refundable cash payments made to clients  to acquire or extend a contractual relationship 
to the extent these costs are recoverable  the company capitalizes these costs and amortizes them ratably over the life of the contract as a reduction of revenue 
recoverability is established through revenues to be earned under the related contract or contract termination penalties payable by the client in the event that the client terminates the contract early 
due to competitive pressures  this trend of granting cash signing bonuses in exchange for acquisition or extensions of contractual relationships may continue 
although these costs are recoverable under the terms of the contract  the payment and related amortization of customer acquisition costs will result in a negative impact on the company s revenues  operating income and cash flows 
as of december   the company estimates the amortization of these customer acquisition costs will result in a reduction in revenues 
revenue recognition for certain img contracts  the company recognizes software license and related professional and consulting revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion 
during  less than of the company s consolidated revenues were recognized using the percentage of completion method 
this method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the terms of the contracts  recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contracts progress to completion 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues 
when estimates indicate a loss under a contract  a provision for such loss is recorded as a component of the costs of providing services 
as work progresses under a loss contract  revenues continue to be recognized  and a portion of the contract loss incurred in each period is charged to the contract loss reserve 
pension plan assets the company maintains various defined benefit and defined contributions plans  which provide retirement benefits to eligible employees 
the cash balance plan  a defined benefit plan that covers eligible us employees  is the most significant and the only funded defined benefit pension plan 
during  the company recorded pension expense of related to this plan 
the most significant factor in determining the amount of expense or income recorded for the funded plan is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
during the last four years  the company has used an expected long term rate of return of  which it expects to use again in in determining the amount of pension expense to be recognized  the expected long term rate of return that is discussed above is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in fair value over a three year period 
this practice has the effect of reducing year to year volatility in recorded pension expense 
moreover  future asset related losses would possibly require management to reduce the expected long term rate of return from the current to a lower amount  a change that would also increase the amount of expense in the future 
on the other hand  asset returns in excess of in future years could potentially result in the use of a higher rate  which would have the effect of reducing pension expense 

table of contents market risk the company s activities expose it to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company s risk management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on its operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates  the company exposes itself to some counterparty credit risk 
the company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements and by diversifying the number of financial institutions with which it enters into such agreements 
interest rate risk at december   the company had in outstanding variable rate borrowings and had sold in accounts receivable on a variable rate basis 
the carrying amount of the company s borrowings reflects fair value due to its short term and variable interest rate features 
additionally  as more fully disclosed under the heading financial condition  liquidity and capital resources  the company leases its office complex in orlando  florida under a synthetic lease arrangement accounted for as an operating lease 
under the terms of the arrangement  the company pays a variable lease rate  but has converted the variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate of through an interest rate swap with a nominal value of the company uses cash flow hedges for interest rate exposure 
these instruments are hedges of forecasted transactions or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
other than the interest rate swap associated with the synthetic lease arrangement  there were no outstanding cash flow hedges covering interest rate exposure at december  based upon the company s exposure to variable rate borrowings  a one percent point change in the weighted average interest rate would change the company s annual interest expense by approximately foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed include the british pound  the indian rupee  the euro and the canadian dollar 
the company currently uses forward exchange contracts to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
the potential loss in fair value at december  for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
fluctuations in quarterly results the company has experienced  and in the future could experience  quarterly variations in revenues as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
these factors include economic cycles  the timing of new contracts  the timing of increased expenses incurred in support of new business  the timing and frequency of client spending for system enhancement requests  the timing of contractual rate reductions triggered by subscriber growth or the passage of time and the seasonal pattern of the cmg business
