our fiscal year end is the last friday of september or the first frida y of october 
this results in a or week year depending on the calendar 
ou r first three fiscal quarters end on the friday last preceding december  march  and june or the first friday of the following month of each quarter 
fiscal was weeks and ended on october  the and fiscal years were week years 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain data from our statements of income  expressed as a percentage of revenues  for each of the periods presented 
fiscal years ended october  september  sep tember  revenues retail institutional total revenues cost of goods sold gross profit selling and marketing expense general and administrative expense provision for acquisition and plant start up expenses operating profit interest expense  net income tax expense other net income management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we believe we are the largest producer and one of the fastest growing major marketers of dry pasta in north america 
we began operations in we believe our singular focus on pasta  our vertically integrated facilities and highly efficient production facilities focused primarily on specific market segments and our highly skilled workforce make us a more efficient company and enable us to produce high quality pasta at very competitive costs 
we believe that the combination of our low cost structure  the addition of several new brands to our portfolio of brands  our scalable production facilities and our key customer relationships create opportunity for continued growth 
we generate revenues in two customer markets retail and institutional retail market revenues include the revenues from sales of our pasta products to customers who resell the pasta in retail channels 
these revenues represented and of our total revenue for the years ended october  and september   respectively  and include sales to club stores and grocery retailers  and encompass sales of our private label and branded products 
institutional market revenues include revenues from product sales to customers who use our pasta as an ingredient in food products or who resell our pasta in the foodservice market 
it also includes revenues from opportunistic sales to government agencies and other customers that we pursue periodically when capacity is available to increase production volumes and thereby lower average unit costs 
the institutional market represented and of our total revenue for the years ended october  and september   respectively 
average sales prices in the retail and institutional markets vary depending on customer specific packaging and raw material requirements  product manufacturing complexity and other service requirements 
average retail and institutional prices will also vary due to changes in the relative share of customer revenues and item specific sales volumes ie  product sales mix 
generally  average retail sales prices are higher than institutiona l sales prices 
selling prices of our branded products are significantly higher than selling prices in our other business units including private label 
this results in higher revenues  gross profits  and gross margin percentages than ou r non branded businesses 
revenues are reported net of cash discounts and product returns 
we seek to develop strategic customer relationships with food industry leaders that have substantial pasta requirements 
we have a long term supply agreement with sysco  which was renewed for an additional three years in the third quarter of fiscal  and other arrangements with food industry leaders such as sam s club  that provide for the pass through of direct material cost changes as pricing adjustments 
the pass throughs are generally limited to actual changes in cost and  as a result  impact percentage profitability in periods of changing costs and prices 
the pass throughs are generally effective to days following such cost changes and thereby significantly reduce the long term exposure of our operating results to the volatility of raw material costs 
these pass through arrangements also require us to pass on the benefits of any price decrease in raw material cases 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials  packaging  manufacturing including depreciation and distribution costs 
a significant portion of our cost of goods sold is durum wheat 
we purchase durum wheat on th e open market and  consequently  those purchases are subject to fluctuations in cost 
we manage our durum wheat cost risk through durum wheat cost pass through agreements in long term contracts and other noncontractual arrangements with our customers and advance purchase contracts for durum wheat which are generally less than twelve months duration 
our capital asset strategy is to achieve low cost production through vertical integration and investment in the most current pasta making assets and technologies 
the manufacturing and distribution related capital assets that have been or will be acquired to support this strategy are depreciated over their respective economic lives 
because of the capital intensive nature of our business and our current and future facilities expansion plans  we believe our depreciation expense for production and distribution assets may be higher than that of many of our competitors 
depreciation expense is a component of inventory cost and cost of goods sold 
plant expansion costs include incrementa l direct and indirect manufacturing and distribution costs that are incurred as a result of construction  commissioning and start up of new manufacturing capacity 
these costs are expensed as incurred but are unrelated to current production and  therefore  reported as a separate line item in the statement of operations 
by locating our newest facility in arizona closer to our western us customers  we believe we will generate significant logistical savings and provide superior service to our west coast customers  while creating additional capacity to support the continued rapid growth of our business sourced from our existing plants 
we believe adding this strategic location will further enhance our low cost producer leadership in the industry 
selling and marketing costs increased substantially in both fiscal years and  in line with the significant expansion of our retail business 
these costs constituted and of revenues for the years ended october  and september  in november  we purchased the mueller s r pasta brand from bestfoods 
in july  we purchased seven pasta brands from borden foods 
in september  we purchased the lensi brand  and in october  we purchased the martha gooch and larosa brands 
in addition  we purchased the golden grain mission pasta brand and mrs 
leeper s pasta brand in january and february  respectively 
as discussed below  the timing of these brand acquisitions had an impact on the period to period comparisons 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis discusses our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  whic h have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as discussed in note to our october  consolidate d financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity wit h accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of intangible assets  the method of accounting for stock options  the estimates used to record product return reserves  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts and derivatives 
our management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantia l historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
see note to our october  consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our significan t accounting policies 
our most critical accounting policies are described below 
impairment testing of intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize the cost of intangible assets with indefinite lives 
sfas no 
requires that we perform certain fair value base d tests of the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually and more frequently should events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
these impairment tests are impacted by judgments as to future cash flows and brand performance 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
future event s could cause our management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and tha t the value of intangible assets is impaired 
stock options 
we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options and have adopted the pro forma disclosure requirements under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
under apb no 
 because the exercise price of our employee stock options is equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by sfas no 
and has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas no 
the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a black schole s option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions risk free interest rate of for fiscal  dividend yield of zero  a volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock of 
for fiscal and a weighted average expected life of the options of one to five years 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
accounts receivable significant customers 
we generate approximately of our revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to two international customers 
if our primary customers experience significant advers e conditions in their industry or operations  our customers may not be able to meet their ongoing financial obligations to us for prior sales or complete the purchase of additional products from us under the terms of our existing purchas e and sale commitments 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings  substantial down grading of credit scores  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  and our historical experience 
if circumstances chang e ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change i n a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a materia l amount 
derivatives 
we hold derivative financial instruments to hedge a variety of risk exposures including interest rate risks associated with variabl e rate long term debt and foreign currency risks associated with our italy operations 
these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as discussed in detail in note to our october  consolidated financial statements 
we d o not participate in speculative derivatives trading 
hedge accounting results when we designate and document the hedging relationships involving these derivative instruments 
while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if we did no t believe that forecasted transactions would occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
to hedge foreign currency risks  we use futures contracts 
the fair values of these instruments are determined from market quotes 
these forward contracts are valued in a manner similar to that used by the market to value exchange traded contracts  that is  using standard valuation formulas with assumptions about future foreign currency exchange rates derived from existing exchange rates  and interest rates observed in the market 
to hedge interest rate risks  an interest rate swap is used to effectively convert a portion of variable rate debt to fixed rate 
this instrument is valued using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected variable cash payments 
the variable cash payments are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interest rate curves 
we have not changed our methods of calculating these fair values or developing the underlying assumptions 
the values of these derivative s will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
our derivative instruments are not subject to multiples or leverage on the underlying commodity or price index 
information about the fair values  notional amounts  and contractual terms of these instruments can be found in note to our october  consolidated financial statements and th e section titled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we consider our budgets and forecasts in determining the amounts of ou r foreign currency to hedge 
we combine the forecasts with historical observation s to establish the percentage of our forecast we are assuming to be probable of occurring  and therefore eligible to be hedged 
the purchases are hedged for exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our interest rate and foreign currency hedges as the counter parties are established  well capitalized financial institutions 
our exposure is in liquid currency euros  so there is minimal risk that appropriate derivatives to maintain our hedging program would not be available in the future

these increases were partially offset by higher raw material costs  principally durum wheat 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the fiscal year ended october  from for the fiscal year ended septembe r  this change in gross margin percentage is due to a number of offsetting factors 
factors putting downward pressure on margins included sales mix changes greater growth in private label and ingredient versus branded  th e inherent margin reduction that mathematically occurs with the pass through of durum cost increases  and lower net revenues associated with the department of commerce payments

we benefited from a us government dumping and subsidy offset payment of million recorded as gross retail revenue in the year 
in accordance with the intent of the act  we implemented incremental spending programs  including slotting fees to expand distribution  adding personnel and increased promotions 
volume growth was led by the july acquisition of seven pasta brands from borden foods and by growth in private label and ingredient volumes

cash and temporary investments totaled million and net working capital totaled million at october  at september   cash and temporary cash investments totaled million and working capital totaled million 
the million increase in working capital in fiscal year was financed with cash generated by operations 
our net cash provided by operating activities totaled million fo r the fiscal year ended october  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  and million for the fiscal year ended september  improved operating results were partially offset by increased working capital requirements  primarily related to an increase in inventory

we currently use cash to fund capital expenditures  repayments of debt and working capital requirements and acquisitions 
we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures  repayments of debt  and working capital requirements 
on july   we secured a new five year  million revolving credit facility to replace the previous million facility 
the revolver includes million of dual currency availability in euros or us dollars to finance our international business in italy 
the credit facility matures on october  available borrowings under the credit facility were  at october  on december   we completed a million term loan facility a s an amendment to our existing revolving credit agreement 
the terms of the original revolving credit facility provide commitment reductions of millio n between october  and october  there are no material differences between the terms of the original credit facility and the amended credit facility 
the principal maturity terms of the million  long term revolving credit facility are as follows amount date in thousands scheduled commitment reduction  october  scheduled commitment reduction  october  scheduled commitment reduction  october  scheduled commitment reduction  october  final maturity  october  interest is charged at libor euribor plus an applicable margin based o n a sliding scale of the ratio of the company s total indebtedness divided by earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
in addition  a commitment fee is charged on the unused facility balance based on the sliding scale of the company s total indebtedness divided by ebitda 
the stated interest per the credit facility plus the commitment fee is classified a s interest expense 
at october   the three month libor rate was  the three month euribor rate was  and our weighted average bank debt borrowing rate per the credit facility was 
our credit agreement contains restrictive covenants which include  among other things  financial covenants requiring minimum and cumulative earnings levels and limitations on the payment of dividends  stock purchases an d our ability to enter into certain contractual arrangements 
we do not expect these limitations to have a material effect on business or results of operations 
we are in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the credit agreement 
we utilize interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contract s to manage interest rate and foreign currency exposures 
the principal objective of such financial derivative contracts is to moderate the effect of fluctuation s in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we  as a matter of policy  do not speculate in financial markets and therefore do not hold these contracts for trading purposes 
we utilize what are considered simple instruments  such as forward foreign exchange contracts and non leveraged interest rate swaps  to accomplish our objectives 
at this time  the current and projected borrowings under our credit facility do not exceed the facility s available commitment 
the facility mature s on october  we anticipate that any borrowings outstanding at that time will be satisfied with funds from operations or will be refinanced 
we have no other material commitments 
we believe that net cash expected to be provided by operating activities and net cash provided by financing activities will be sufficient to meet our expected capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future

we have experienced increases in our cost of borrowing and raw materials  though generally not related to inflation 
in general  we have increased the majority of customer sales prices to recover significant raw material cost increases 
however  these changes in prices have historically lagged price increases in our raw material costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to market risk associated with financial instruments relates to interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
to manage our interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings  we utilize simple derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps 
we had various fixed interest rate swa p agreements with notional amounts of million outstanding at october  the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap agreements of  i s the amount we would be required to pay to terminate the swap agreements at october  if interest rates for our long term debt under our credit facility had averaged more and the full amount available under our credit facility had been outstanding for the entire year  our interest expense would have increased  and income before taxes would have decreased by million fo r the year ended october  at october  we had investment in our italy operations of euro million million 
we hedge our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with euro borrowings under our credit facility in the us at october   long term debt includes obligations of euro million million 
interest on our euro debt is at variable rates and based on euribor market rates 
changes in the us dollar equivalent of euro based borrowings is recorded as a component of the net translation adjustment in the consolidated statement of stockholder s equity 
the functional currency for our italy operations is the euro 
we have transactional exposure to various other european currencies  primarily the british pound 
our net exposure is approximately euro million million 
we occasionally use forward purchase contracts to hedge this exposure at october   we have outstanding forward contracts of euro million and pound million
