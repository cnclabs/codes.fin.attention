item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company owns and manages residential and commercial real estate in several states across the united states 
the company is also engaged in the exploration and development of oil and gas  both in its own name and through several wholly owned subsidiaries  on the north american continent 
real estate the company s real estate operations are conducted in the states of arizona  texas  florida  georgia and new jersey 
the company s properties consist of apartment complexes as well as commercial and retail properties 
oil and gas the company conducts its oil and gas operations in the united states and canada 
oil and gas operations in the united states are located in arkansas  california  kansas  nebraska  new mexico  ohio  oklahoma  pennsylvania  texas  wyoming  utah  and west virginia 
in canada  the company conducts oil and gas operations in the provinces of alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan 
corporate the company holds passive investments in certain marketable securities 
from time to time  the company buys and sells securities in the open market 
over the years  the company has decreased its holdings in marketable securities and focused its resources in its oil gas and real estate divisions 
general oil and gas the company s oil and gas operating performance is influenced by several factors 
the most significant are the prices received for the sale of oil and gas and the sales volume 
for  the average price of oil that the company received was compared to for the average price of gas for was compared to for the following table reflects the average prices received by the company for oil and gas  the average production cost per boe  and the amount of the company s oil and gas production for the fiscal years presented fiscal year ended december crude oil and natural gas production oil bbls    gas mcf    average sales prices oil per bbl gas per mfc average production costs per boe sales prices received by the company for oil and gas have fluctuated significantly from period to period 
the fluctuations in oil prices during these periods primarily reflected market uncertainty regarding the inability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to control the production of its member countries  as well as concerns related to global supply and demand for crude oil 
gas prices received by the company fluctuate generally with changes in the spot market price for gas 
it is impossible to predict future price movements with certainty 
critical accounting policies wilshire s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon wilshire s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires wilshire to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
wilshire bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
oil and gas properties the company follows the accounting policy  generally known in the oil and gas industry as full cost accounting 
under full cost accounting  the company capitalizes all costs  including interest costs  relating to the exploration for and development of its mineral resources 
under this method  all costs incurred in the united states and canada are accumulated in separate cost centers and are amortized using the gross revenue method based on total future estimated recoverable oil and gas reserves 
the determination of oil and gas reserves is a complex and interpretive process  which is subject to continued revisions as additional information becomes available 
reserve estimates prepared by different engineers from the same data can vary widely 
therefore  the reserve data presented herein should not be construed as being exact 
any reserve estimate  especially when based upon volumemetric calculations  depends in part on the quality of available data  engineering and geologic interpretation and judgment  and thus  represents only an informed professional judgment 
subsequent reservoir performance may justify upward or downward revision of the estimate 
capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value  using a discount rate of of the future net revenues of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
management is of the opinion that  based on reserve reports of petroleum engineers and geologists  the fair value of the estimated recoverable oil and gas reserves exceeds the unamortized cost of oil and gas properties at december  and impairment of property and equipment in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard harmonizes the accounting for impaired assets and resolves some of the implementation issues as originally described in sfas sfas  among other things  will require the company to classify the operations and cash flow of properties to be disposed of as discontinued operations 
the company adopted this pronouncement on january  this adoption had no impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is considered impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
management does not believe at december  and that the value of any of its rental properties is impaired 
revenue recognition revenue from oil and gas properties is recognized at the time these products are delivered to third party purchasers 
revenue from real estate properties is recognized during the period in which the premises are occupied and rent is due from tenant 
rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in accounts receivable 
an allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained based on the company s estimate of the inability of its joint interest partners in the oil and gas division and its tenants in the real estate division to make required payments 
foreign operations the assets and liabilities of the company s canadian subsidiary have been translated at year end exchange rates 
the related revenues and expenses have been translated at average annual exchange rates 
the aggregate effect of translation losses are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign investment 
unremitted earnings of the canadian subsidiary are intended to be permanently invested in canada and are subject to foreign taxes substantially equivalent to united states federal income taxes 
the unremitted earnings on which the company has not been required to provide federal income taxes amounted to approximately  and  at december   and  respectively

in november of  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
the disclosure provisions of this interpretation are effective for the company s december  financial statements 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact that this interpretation will have on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which provides guidance on how to transition from the intrinsic method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under apb no

in january of  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation clarifies the application of existing accounting pronouncements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of the interpretation will be immediately effective for all variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and we will need to apply its provisions to any existing variable interests in variable interest entities by no later than september  we do not believe that this interpretation will have a significant impact on our financial statements

effects of inflation the effects of inflation on the company s financial condition are not considered to be material by management 
liquidity and capital resources at december  the company had approximately million in marketable securities at cost  with a market value of approximately million 
the current ratio at december  was to on a market basis and the company s working capital was million at december  management considers these amounts adequate for the company s current business 
the company anticipates that cash provided by operating activities and investing activities will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements to acquire oil and gas properties and to drill and evaluate these and other oil and gas properties presently held by the company 
the level of oil and gas capital expenditures will vary in future periods depending on market conditions  including the price of oil and the demand for natural gas  and other related factors 
as the company has no material long term commitments with respect to its oil and gas capital expenditure plans  the company has a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of its expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the company continues to search for the acquisition of oil and gas producing properties and of companies with desirable oil and gas producing properties 
there can be no assurance that the company will in fact locate any such acquisitions 
during  the company did not acquire any additional real estate properties 
the company will continue to explore real estate acquisitions as they arise 
the timing of any such acquisition will depend on  among other things  economic conditions and the favorable evaluation of specific opportunities presented to the company 
the company is currently planning acquisitions of investment properties in addition to the desposition of certain existing properties 
however  while the company anticipates that it will actively explore these and other real estate acquisition opportunities  no assurance can be given that any such acquisition will occur

the sec defines proved oil and gas reserves as those estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions

future price changes are considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements 
estimated future development and production costs are determined by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year  based on year end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions 
estimated future income tax expenses are calculated by applying year end statutory tax rates adjusted for permanent differences and tax credits to estimated future pretax net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reserves  less the tax basis of the properties involved 
these estimates are furnished and calculated in accordance with requirements of the financial accounting standards board and the sec 
due to unpredictable variances in expenses and capital forecasts  crude oil and natural gas price changes and the fact that the basis for such estimates vary significantly  management believes the usefulness of these projections is limited 
estimates of future net cash flows do not represent management s assessment of future profitability or future cash flow to the company 
management s investment and operating decisions are based upon reserve estimates that include proved reserves prescribed by the sec as well as probable reserves  and upon different price and cost assumptions from those used here 
it should be recognized that applying current costs and prices at a percent standard discount rate allows for comparability but does not convey absolute value 
the discounted amounts arrived at are only one measure of financial quantification of proved reserves 
there were no oil and gas estimates filed with or included in reports to any other federal or foreign governmental authority or agency within the last twelve months 
reserves in the united states were estimated by ryder scott company and the company
