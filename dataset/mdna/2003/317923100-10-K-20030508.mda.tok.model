 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which generally requires the company to assess these assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers historical performances and future estimated results in its evaluation of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual store discounted cash flows to the asset carrying values 
the estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the discount rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
actual results may differ from these estimates and as a result the estimation of fair values may be adjusted in the future

management believes that cash on hand  operating cash flow and borrowings under the company s existing facility will be sufficient to complete the company s fiscal store expansion program and to satisfy the company s other capital requirements through fiscal effects of inflation 
as the costs of inventory and other expenses of the company have increased  the company has generally been able to increase its selling prices 
in periods of high inflation  increased build out and other costs could adversely affect the company s expansion plans 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its investments in available for sale marketable securities 
the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would adversely effect the net fair value of the company s marketable securities by  at march
