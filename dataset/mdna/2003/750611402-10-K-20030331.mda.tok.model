item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we design  manufacture  integrate  install and sell products  systems and software used in the ground based portion of satellite communication systems to receive  and transmit data  video  audio and internet over satellite  microwave and cable communications networks 
our products are used in applications for telephone  data  video and audio broadcast communications  private and corporate data networks  internet applications  and digital television for cable and network broadcast 
through our network of international offices and service centers  we serve customers in over countries  including customers in the television broadcast industry  international telecommunications companies  internet service providers  private communications networks  network and cable television and the united states government 
on december   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of armer communications engineering services  inc armer for an aggregate purchase price of million 
this purchase price consisted of million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
the fair value of the stock was determined based on the average market price of the stock over a reasonable period of time before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced 
armer specializes in innovative solutions for the integration and installation of turnkey satellite communications systems 
this acquisition was recorded in accordance with the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired was approximately million and was recorded as goodwill  which was amortized on a straight line basis over twelve years until the adoption of sfas on january   at which time amortization was suspended and new accounting rules took effect 
the results of operations of the acquired operations have been included in the accompanying statements of operations from the acquisition date 
on april   we completed the acquisition of all of the assets of tiernan communications  inc for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we manufacture the tiernan products  which are used in the television broadcast industry 
the acquisition has been recorded in accordance with the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was approximately million and has been recorded as goodwill  which was amortized on a straight line basis over seven years until the adoption of sfas on january  during the third quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce costs and address the economic slowdown and negative industry conditions 
this plan included the reduction in force of approximately of our workforce in the manufacturing  research and development and sales departments  the abandonment of certain non performing and under performing product lines and a provision for the excess space created as a result of these cost cutting measures 
this effort resulted in a charge to our operating expenses of approximately million  of which  was charged to cost of sales and the balance was charged to selling  general and administrative expenses 
this amount included  in severance costs 
as of december   we have reduced our workforce from employees at december  to employees  abandoned certain non performing and under performing product lines  reduced our utilized work space in the san diego facility from approximately  square feet at december  to  square feet and paid all charges except for  in lease exit costs  which will be paid over the lease term expiring in february critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company s management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of 
table of contents revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  and contingencies based upon historical results  anticipated future events and various other assumptions  factors  and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting polices as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
we do not consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy due to the nature of our business in which revenues are generally recognized upon the actual shipment of product and transfer of the risk of ownership to our customers in accordance with sec staff bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended 
accordingly  other than for estimates related to warranty obligations  the recording of revenue does not require significant judgments or estimates 
management believes the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements relate to valuation of receivables 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as through the creation of reserves established for specific customers deemed marginal in their ability to pay based upon factors known at that time 
in general  if the financial condition of a customer was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation and impairment of intangible assets 
in assessing our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to make significant assumptions about the future cash flows  overall performance  identity and allocation and valuation of the assets including goodwill and other intangibles of our reporting units 
market prices are not readily available for certain businesses  unique physical assets  and most intangible assets to be valued in goodwill impairment tests 
therefore  we estimate fair values using estimating techniques and assumptions that are matters of judgment 
our transitional impairment analysis of goodwill as of january   as required by sfas  yielded an impairment charge of million  recorded in fourth quarter as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
we have no remaining goodwill on our balance sheet as of december  warranty liability 
we provide limited warranties on certain of our products and systems for periods generally not exceeding two years 
estimated warranty costs for potential product liability and warranty claims based on our claim experience are accrued as cost of sales at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our vendors  our warranty liability is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s present estimates  additional warranty liabilities may be required 
valuation of inventories 
inventories  consisting of satellite modems and related products  are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
our inventories include high technology components and systems sold into rapidly changing and competitive markets  whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value 
assumptions about future demand  
table of contents market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in any case  actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes 
management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
in addition  we consider historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our net sales decreased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the lingering effects of the economic slowdown over the last two years and was partially offset by full year sales of products from the tiernan acquisition compared to approximately months of those sales during our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased by to during the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the change in costs as a percent of sales is primarily due to changes in the mix of products shipped  namely  the typically lower margins on the armer products and higher unabsorbed overhead from our core businesses due to the lower sales during the current year 
other factors include a  inventory write down taken in the third quarter  which was a result of the abandonment of certain non performing and under performing product lines and was related to the reduction of our workforce related to manufacturing activities to employees at december  from employees at december   and the abandonment of certain manufacturing facilities as is discussed further below 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased to million  or of sales  during the year ended december  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in expenses during the year is primarily attributed to the cost saving initiatives put in place during the year as a result of the continued depressed market place 
these initiatives included the reduction of our workforce related to these activities to employees at december  from employees at december   the reduction of our utilized work space in the san diego facility from approximately  square feet at december  to approximately  square feet at december  the decrease was partially offset by increased spending on our information technologies during the year of approximately  to upgrade our management information systems in our phoenix facility 
the increase as a percentage of sales was due to the lower sales amounts during the current year compared to the prior period 
research and development expenditures decreased to million  or of sales during the year ended december  from million  or of sales  during the year ended december  we remain committed to invest in our future through technological advances and our efforts to improve our older product lines for manufacturability and lower costs  however  we found it necessary  during the current year  to scale back on these expenditures  in light of the current market situation 
our efforts to reduce costs included the reduction of our 
table of contents workforce related to our research efforts to employees at december  from employees at december  our research and development personnel concentrate on technology for the satellite and microwave communications  telecommunications  and cable television industries  as well as the newly acquired tiernan product lines  which target the digital television broadcast industry 
we recorded an asset impairment charge of  related to the write down of purchased technologies 
this intangible asset  which was originally valued at million  was identified as the fair value of proprietary technologies purchased in the comstream acquisition and was being amortized on a straight line basis over the expected life of the asset  which was originally estimated to be years 
it was determined during the third quarter restructuring effort  that this asset had been impaired because the products with which the technologies were associated have been slow moving and rendered low margins and  therefore  we determined to abandon the product lines in favor of newer technologies 
this non cash charge will eliminate the amortization expense related to the intangible asset  which amounted to approximately  per year 
during the third quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce costs and address the economic slowdown and negative industry conditions 
this restructuring plan included the reduction in force of approximately of our workforce in the manufacturing  research and development and sales departments and a provision for the excess space created as a result of these cost cutting measures 
this effort resulted in a charge to our operating expenses of approximately million 
the expense related to the reduction in force was  as of december   we have reduced our workforce from employees at december  to employees  reduced our utilized work space in the san diego facility from approximately  square feet at december  to  square feet  and paid all charges except for  in lease exit costs  which will be paid over the lease term expiring in february as a result of the decrease in our gross profit and our higher operating costs  we recorded a loss from operations of million during compared to earnings of million in interest expense increased to  in from  in  due to higher capitalized lease obligations during the current fiscal year compared to the year ended december  interest income decreased to  in from  in though our average cash balance on hand during the year ended december  increased to million from million during  the lower average interest rate earned during the year reduced to compared to average in the prior year 
we recorded an income tax benefit in of  due to a tax refund  compared to an income tax expense of million in the decrease in expense is due to the loss incurred in the current fiscal year compared to net income in the prior year 
due to the net loss experienced in and the priority in which net operating loss carryforwards are utilized  we provided a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets arising in we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on january   the first day of fiscal therefore  the amortization of goodwill  which was approximately  for the year ended december   was suspended effective on that date 
we also performed our transitional impairment analysis of goodwill as of january   as required by 
table of contents sfas this analysis yielded an impairment charge of million  recorded in fourth quarter as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
we have no remaining goodwill on our balance sheet as of december  including restructuring and asset impairment charges and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  the company reported a net loss of million  or per share on a fully diluted basis for net income was million or per fully diluted share for excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  we reported a net loss of million or per fully diluted share for new orders booked bookings decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the economic slowdown over the prior year 
our backlog of orders to be shipped  which are unshipped orders from the prior period plus new orders booked less orders shipped during the period  was million as of december   a decrease of from the million in backlog as of december  this reduction is a direct result of the lower bookings compared to sales during the current period 
our backlog consists of orders as evidenced by written contracts and or purchase orders from customers with fixed pricing and delivery dates 
we charge cancellation charges for orders that cancel and the net difference between the backlog amount and the cancellation charge is recorded as a negative booking 
there is no guarantee that cancellation charges will ultimately be paid to us 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our net sales decreased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the economic slowdown over the last year and was offset by sales of products from the tiernan and armer acquisitions 
the products attributable to these acquisitions accounted for approximately million of sales during the current year compared to approximately million of sales for the prior year 
we experience margins on the tiernan products that are comparable to our other products and lower margins on the armer products and services 
our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased by to during the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the change in costs as a percent of sales is primarily due to changes in the mix of products shipped  namely  the typically lower margins on the armer products and higher unabsorbed overhead from our core businesses due to the lower sales during the current year 
selling  general and administrative costs increased to million  or of sales  during the year ended december  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  the increase in expenses during the year is primarily attributed to the additional expenses associated with the armer and tiernan product lines  which were approximately million and million respectively 
research and development expenditures increased to million  or of sales  during the year ended december  from million  or of sales  during the year ended december  in addition to our continued commitment to invest in our future through technological advances and our efforts to improve our older product lines for manufacturability and lower costs  the increase in research and development expenses reflects added efforts for our tiernan product lines and a significant effort to develop the ipsat related product lines 
our research and development personnel concentrate on technology for the satellite and microwave communications  telecommunications  and cable television industries  as well as the newly acquired tiernan product lines  which target the digital television broadcast industry 
we have reorganized to reduce research and development costs for the ensuing year by reducing personnel dedicated to the ipsat product lines as we believe we are nearing completion of the development phase of this product 
as a result of the decrease in our gross profit and our higher operating costs as a percentage of sales  in compared to in  we recorded earnings from operations of million during compared to million in interest expense decreased to  in  or of sales  from  in  or 
of sales  due to the payoff of our credit line during the prior year 

table of contents interest income decreased to  in from million in the decrease is due to the reduced cash levels in compared to as discussed below  cash decreased primarily as a result of the acquisition in tiernan in april we recorded an income tax expense in of million effective tax rate compared to an income benefit in of million effective tax rate 
the benefit recorded in the prior year was primarily due to a tax benefit of million in the third quarter of resulting from the reduction of the valuation allowance pertaining to our net operating loss carryforward 
based on all of the above  we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted weighted average share outstanding  during as compared to million  or per diluted weighted average share outstanding  during new orders booked bookings decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the economic slowdown over the prior year 
our backlog of orders to be shipped  which are unshipped orders from the prior period plus new orders booked less orders shipped during the period  was million as of december   a decrease of from the million in backlog as of december  this reduction is a direct result of the lower bookings compared to sales during the current period 
our backlog consists of firm orders as evidenced by written contracts and or purchase orders from customers 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million at december   which represents a decrease of million from million at december  our working capital decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively 
the decreases were offset by an increase in cash of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
see the discussion below of events related to this activity 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the change is primarily due to a decrease in inventory of million to million for the year ended december   compared to an increase of million during the year ended december  in addition  accounts receivable decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to an increase of million during the year ended december  accrued expense decreased by only million during the year ended december  compared to a decrease of million during the year ended december  this activity  which resulted in positive changes in the company s cash flow was partially offset by a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to net earnings of million for the year ended december  however  the net loss during the current year included items that did not have an effect on cash  such as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million which represented the impairment of the remaining goodwill related to prior year acquisitions  and an asset impairment charge of million and depreciation and amortization of million  which were included in the net loss for the year ended december  but had no effect on cash 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  and cash provided by operating activities of million during the year ended december  cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to assets  net of cash  acquired from tiernan communications in the amount of million during the year ended december  in addition  capital expenditures were reduced to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  we derived net cash from financing activities of   and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
during the year ended december   net cash from financing activities was generated primarily through the exercise of stock options and stock purchased through our employee stock purchase plan  which provided net proceeds of  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   net cash from financing activities was generated primarily through a public offering  which generated cash of million  net of offering costs 
the exercise of warrants  which were issued in connection with the public offering  provided additional proceeds of million 
these proceeds were partially offset by payments made on our line of credit of million in fiscal 
table of contents we have a credit arrangement with a bank for up to million  based upon of eligible accounts receivable  as defined 
the amount of credit available to us under the credit agreement at december  was million 
we pay a facility fee of for the committed portion of the arrangement whether or not any amounts are actually drawn on the line of credit 
at december  and  we had no borrowings against the line of credit 
the credit agreement expires on june  and prohibits mergers  consolidations  acquisitions  transfers of assets  liens  loans and investments in other entities and limits the use of proceeds  acquisitions of assets  indebtedness and capital expenditures without the bank s consent 
to be eligible to draw funds under the line of credit  the credit agreement requires singapore technologies pte ltd  our controlling stockholder beneficially owning approximately of our outstanding common stock  to maintain at least a ownership interest in the company and contains certain financial covenants requiring us to maintain specific levels of tangible net worth  earnings and other ratios 
we were in material compliance with all covenants at december  we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand  anticipated future cash receipts  and borrowings available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
however  a decrease in our sales or demand for our products or services would likely affect our working capital amounts 
furthermore  failure to maintain compliance with any of the covenants in our credit facility agreement could cause us to lose the ability to draw down funds from the line of credit if we are unable to obtain a waiver or renegotiate the credit agreement 
as part of our business strategy  we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies 
accordingly  a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses 
these potential transactions may require substantial capital resources  which  in turn  may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
there are no assurances that we will be able to consummate any of these transactions
