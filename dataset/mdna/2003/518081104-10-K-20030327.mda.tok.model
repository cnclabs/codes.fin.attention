item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our discussion and analysis of laserscope s financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows are based upon laserscope s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory valuation and obsolescence  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty obligation  excess and obsolete inventory  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  functional currency  and income tax revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from primarily two sources i product revenue which includes lasers  instrumentation  and disposables and ii service revenue 
the company recognizes revenue on products and services when the persuasive evidence of an arrangement is in place  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  remaining obligations are insignificant  and title and risk of ownership has been transferred 
transfer of title and risk of ownership generally occurs when the product is shipped to the customer or when the customer receives the product  depending on the nature of the arrangement 
the company currently provides for the estimated cost to repair or replace products under 
table of contents warranty at the time of sale 
service revenue is recognized as the services are provided and for service contracts on a pro rata basis over the period of the applicable service contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we assess the credit worthiness of our customers prior to making a sale in order to mitigate the risk of loss from customers not paying us 
however  to account for the inevitability that a customer may not pay us  we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate losses based on the overall business climate  our accounts receivable aging profile  and an analysis of the circumstances associated with specific accounts which are past due 
despite the significant amount of analysis used to compute the required allowance  if the financial condition of laserscope s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranties 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
in addition to these proactive measures  we also provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the cost of our warranty obligation based on product failure rates over the last twelve months and the actual material usage and service delivery costs experienced in correcting those failures 
however  should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we maintain reserves for our estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the reserves are equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
in july  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and as a result do not amortize goodwill 
instead  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  at least annually  by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it with its book value 
a reporting unit is the lowest level of an entity that is a business and can be distinguished from other activities  operations  and assets of the entity 
if  during the annual impairment review  the book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value  goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
sfas no 
requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of each reporting unit  other than goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined as the difference between the fair value of a reporting unit  taken as a whole  and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of such reporting unit 
we review other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger an impairment review include  among others  a decrease in the market value of an asset  the asset s inability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  a decision to change the manner in which an asset is used  a physical change to the asset or a change in business climate 
we calculate estimated future undiscounted cash flows  before interest and taxes  of the related operation and compare it to the carrying value of the asset in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
if a potential impairment exists  a calculation is performed to determine the fair value of the long lived asset 
this calculation is based upon a valuation model and discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
third party appraised values may also be used in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of a related reporting unit may require us to record an impairment charge in the future 
the effect of a change in our estimates and assumptions related to goodwill could be on impairment loss equal to as much as the total of goodwill we have reported  which is  functional currency 
we have a foreign subsidiary in france which sells to customers in france  and we also have a subsidiary in the uk which sells to customers in all of europe  except france  as well as customers in pacific rim countries 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to 
table of contents translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records into united states dollars 
our two subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their functional currencies which are also their respective local currencies  the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency is determined based on management s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of it transactions  including billing  financing  payroll  and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
since our two subsidiaries functional currencies are deemed to be the local currencies  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of those subsidiaries financial statements is included in cumulative translation adjustments 
if in the future we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary from its local currency to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
income tax 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
due to a history of operating losses  management believes that there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realization of deferred tax assets and a full valuation allowance is appropriate 
financial review results of operations the following table sets forth certain data from laserscope s consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of net revenues net revenues cost of products and services gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative operating income loss interest expense and other  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss we sell our products to hospitals  outpatient surgery centers  pay per use providers and individual physicians in the united states  europe  the middle east  latin america and the pacific rim 
in the united states  we sell through our direct sales force as well as through a distributor  mckesson corporation medical group 
we also generate export sales through our wholly owned subsidiaries in the united kingdom and france and sell to independent distributors in the rest of the world 
we operate in a technologically advanced  dynamic and highly competitive environment 
our future operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our 
table of contents control 
while we attempt to identify and respond to these conditions in a timely manner  these conditions represent significant risks to our performance 
international sales accounted for  and of our net revenues for  and  respectively 
we believe that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues in the foreseeable future 
a large portion of our international sales occur through our foreign subsidiaries and the remainder result from exports to foreign distributors 
our international sales and operations are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally 
these risks could harm our financial condition  results of operations and future cash flows 
through december   sales outside of the united states have been denominated in the local currencies of the united kingdom and france and in us dollars for the rest of the world 
during  and fluctuations in foreign currencies did not materially affect the results of operations reported by laserscope 
however  we are exposed to foreign currency risk in a number of areas 
although our revenues denominated in us dollars represented over of total revenues in  in and in  market risk exists in foreign countries where we sell in us dollars  and where a major strengthening of the us dollar could have a material negative impact on our business 
in january  our subsidiary in france began to denominate its sales and report its financial statements in the euro 
through  we had not sustained any material adverse impact from the introduction of the euro 
however  any major strengthening of the us dollar against the euro or the british pound sterling could have a material adverse impact on our business 
please refer to the risk factors section of this annual report for further discussion on these and other risks associated with our business

results compared to during  total revenues increased approximately million  or  from during  revenues from the sales of laser equipment and instrumentation increased to million  or of total net revenues  compared to million  or  of total net revenues in increases in revenues from sales of laser equipment and instrumentation resulted from higher unit shipments  although at lower average selling prices  due to increased aesthetic laser shipments as well as the introduction 
table of contents of the pvp laser 
in addition  as we sold more aesthetic lasers  we also sold more instruments that are used with the aesthetic lasers 
the us distributor relationship which we formed with mckesson corporation effective december contributed to the higher aesthetic laser sales 
we believe that we will continue to see moderate increases in our sales of lower priced office based aesthetic lasers in all geographic markets 
in  we believe that overall laser sales will increase due to sales of our new pvp laser for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia 
net revenues from shipments of disposable supplies were higher in than  and were approximately million  or  of total revenues in  compared to approximately million  or of total revenues in the increase is principally due to the january introduction of the pvp laser which has led to increased fiber optic sales 
until recently  our sales have trended towards lower priced office lasers for aesthetic procedures and away from lasers used in hospitals for non aesthetic procedures 
this had resulted in lower sales of disposable supplies since office lasers used in aesthetic procedures  although carrying one time sales of instrumentation  generally do not create a stream of sales of disposable supplies 
however  with the introduction of the pvp laser we sold approximately  disposable fiber optic delivery devices in which has increased our disposables revenue 
we believe that our future sales of instrumentation and disposable supplies depend on our ability to increase our installed base of systems and also to develop and promote surgical procedures that use these products 
service revenues during were even with these revenues were million  or  of total net revenues in  compared to million  or  of total net revenues in higher service revenues at our foreign subsidiaries were offset by marginally lower service revenues in the us we believe that future revenues will depend on increases to the installed base of lasers as well as the acceptance of service contracts by our customers 
product gross margin as a percentage of net product revenues was in compared to in higher product gross margin is primarily due to an increase in domestic laser sales relative to international laser sales in versus historically  domestic product sales have higher margins than international product sales 
we expect that product gross margin  as a percentage of net revenues in  will be at levels similar to however  we expect that these amounts may vary from quarter to quarter during and will depend on product demand and distribution mix 
gross margin from service activities as a percentage of net service revenues was in compared to in the increase reflects a decrease in overhead costs for material and labor relative to revenue 
we expect that gross margin  as a percentage of net revenues from service activities in  will be similar to levels 
research and development expenses result from activities related to the development of new laser  instrumentation and disposable products and the enhancement of our existing products 
in  amounts spent on research and development increased from amounts spent in this was due to an increase of  in clinical trials associated with the pvp laser  the introduction of the i series aesthetic lasers  which are an upgrade of existing products  as well as continuing refinements to other products 
we expect that amounts spent in research and development during will  as a percentage of net revenues  be higher than that which was spent in selling  general and administrative expenses increased in compared to this was due primarily to an increase in headcount as we increased the size of our sales force  higher commission expense following from an increase in revenue  and higher travel expense 
in addition  legal expenses were higher than last year as a result of increased litigation activity 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses during to be at similar levels to  as we continue to invest in educational support as well as marketing programs for the pvp and other lasers 
in  we recorded an income tax provision of  because of the profitability of our uk subsidiary

results compared to during  total revenues decreased approximately million  or  from during  revenues from the sales of laser equipment and instrumentation increased to million  or of total net revenues  compared to million  or  of total net revenues in increases in revenues from sales of laser equipment and instrumentation resulted from higher unit shipments of lasers and corresponding higher shipments of scanning equipment and hand pieces which are used with the lasers 
this was partly offset by lower average selling prices for the lasers due to higher aesthetic laser shipments and lower non aesthetic laser shipments in than in the us distributor relationship which we formed with mckesson corporation effective december contributed to the higher aesthetic laser unit sales 
net revenues from shipments of disposable supplies were lower in than  and were approximately million  or  of total revenues in  compared to approximately million  or of total revenues in the decrease is principally due to reduced shipments of disposable fiber optic devices for hospital surgical procedures in the united states and the pacific rim 
service revenues during were higher than these revenues were million  or  of total net revenues in  compared to million  or  of total net revenues in the increase is primarily due to higher service revenues at our foreign subsidiaries partly offset by marginally lower service revenues in the us product gross margin as a percentage of net product revenues was in compared to in the increase reflects a continued shift in sales mix toward higher margin aesthetic laser product sales versus lower margin surgical product sales 
gross margin from service activities as a percentage of net service revenues was in compared to in the decrease reflects an increase in overhead costs for material and labor relative to revenue 
research and development expenses result from activities related to the development of new laser  instrumentation and disposable products and the enhancement of our existing products 
in  amounts spent on research and development increased from amounts spent in the increase was due to final efforts necessary to bring the pvp laser to market 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in compared to the increase in spending primarily results from increased sales expenses as we increased our selling efforts 
in  we recorded an income tax provision of  because of the profitability of our uk subsidiary 
the us and french entities reported net losses in and both have significant net operating loss carry forwards 
consequently  no income tax provision was recorded for these entities in in  we recorded no income tax provision due to the availability of net operating loss carry forwards 
due to a history of operating losses  management believes that there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realization of deferred tax assets and a full valuation allowance is appropriate in and for our entities that had net operating losses 

table of contents financial review liquidity and capital resources the following table contains selected balance sheet information at december  and in thousands december  december  cash and cash equivalents total assets working capital the net increase in cash and cash equivalents in compared to was due primarily to cash provided by operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities in totaled million 
this was the combined result of the following sources net income of million  deferred revenue million  other accrued liabilities  prepayments and other current assets million  accounts payable increased as we bought more material to support the higher sales volume million  accrued compensation million  and warranty million  depreciation million  and amortization of debt issuance costs million 
these sources were partly offset by the following uses we increased our inventories in order to support the higher sales volumes we are experiencing million  and accounts receivable increased due to higher sales relative to the prior year million 
cash used in investing activities totaled million and consisted of capital expenditures million 
cash used by financing activities totaled  and consisted of a net decrease in line of credit million  and payments on obligations under capital leases million 
these sources were offset by proceeds from the sale of common stock under stock plans million 
laserscope has in place an asset based line of credit which provides up to million in borrowings and expires in september credit is extended based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
laserscope s assets collateralize the credit line which bears an interest rate equivalent to the bank s prime rate plus per annum 
the prime rate at december  was 
borrowings against the line of credit are paid down as the company collects its accounts receivable 
provisions of the bank loan agreement prohibit the payment of dividends on non preferred stock  or the redemption  retirement  repurchase or other acquisition of laserscope stock 
the agreement further requires us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the line and were in compliance with all covenants 
capital expenditures totaled million and million in and  respectively 
these expenditures were due to capitalization of new models of lasers to be used for research and development purposes  purchases for computer systems  and machinery and equipment 
we expect capital expenditures in to be at levels similar to to address our capital needs  on january   we completed a private placement of our common stock providing net proceeds of approximately million to accredited investors  of which million was received in we issued million shares of our no par value common stock at a price of per share 
we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
on february   we completed a private placement of million of subordinate convertible debentures to affiliates of renaissance capital group  inc  with net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the debentures mature seven years from issuance and bear an annual interest rate of 
the debentures are convertible into laserscope common stock with an initial conversion price  which is subject to adjustment  of

the debt to equity requirement is a maximum of  and the current ratio requirement is a minimum of as of december  we were in compliance with the provisions of the covenants 
future payments due under debt and lease obligations as of december  in thousands are as follows operating capital debentures leases leases total total we anticipate that future changes in cash and working capital will be dependent on a number of factors including our ability to effectively manage non cash assets such as inventory and accounts receivable  our ability to anticipate and adapt to the changes in our industry such as new and alternative medical procedures  our level of profitability  and our determination to acquire or invest in products and businesses complementary to ours 
we have historically financed acquisitions using our existing cash resources 
while we believe our existing cash resources  including our bank line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for the next twelve months  additional financing will be required for our currently envisioned long term needs 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in addition  future equity financings could result in dilution to our shareholders  and future debt financings could result in certain financial and operational restrictions

risk factors our business  financial condition and results of operations have been  and in the future may be  affected by a variety of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this report 
limited working capital  potential need to raise additional capital as of december   our total assets were million and our total liabilities were million 
as of the same date  our working capital was million and our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
current and anticipated demand for our products as well as procurement and production affect 
table of contents our need for capital 
changes in these or other factors could have a material impact on capital requirements and may require us to raise additional capital 
for example  to address our capital needs  on january  we completed a private placement of our common stock providing net proceeds of approximately million to accredited investors 
we issued million shares of our no par value common stock at a price of per share 
we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
similarly  on february   we completed a private placement of subordinate convertible debentures to affiliates of renaissance capital group  inc  with net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the debentures mature seven years from issuance and bear an interest rate of 
the debentures are convertible into laserscope common stock at an initial conversion price of  which is subject to adjustment 
the private placement also included warrants convertible into  shares of our common stock 
on march   renaissance capital group  inc and the company agreed to amend the terms of the convertible debentures agreement 
principal payments are to start on august  instead of february  no other terms of the agreement are changed 
in this amendment to the agreement  renaissance also gave notice that it will convert debentures with a face value of  into shares of laserscope common stock on march  there are covenants associated with the debentures for debt to equity ratio  current ratio  and interest coverage 
in the event that we are unable to satisfy any of these covenants  then we would be in default and the lender would have the right to exercise various remedies including declaring due all outstanding principal and interest 
the interest coverage ratio requirement is for the trailing twelve months  and as of december  our interest coverage was future ability to meet the interest coverage requirement will depend primarily on our ability to generate profits 
the debt to equity requirement is a maximum of  and the current ratio requirement is a minimum of as of december  we were in compliance with the provisions of the covenants 
in  except for shares issued through the company s employee stock purchase plan and the incentive stock option plans  the only other capital raised was through the exercise of warrants  which resulted in the issuance of  shares 
we anticipate that future changes in cash and working capital will be dependent on a number of factors including our ability to manage effectively non cash assets such as inventory and accounts receivable  our ability to anticipate and adapt to the changes in our industry such as new and alternative medical procedures  our level of profitability  and our determination to acquire or invest in products and businesses complementary to ours 
we have historically financed acquisitions using our existing cash resources 
while we believe our existing cash resources  including our bank line of credit  will be sufficient to fund our operating needs for the next twelve months  additional financing will be required for our currently envisioned long term needs 
there also can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in addition  future equity financings could result in dilution to our shareholders  and future debt financings could result in certain financial and operational restrictions 
history of losses  uncertainty of future profitability at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we reported net income of million for the year ended december   net loss of million for the year ended december  
table of contents  and net income of million for the year ended december  there can be no assurance that we can achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly basis or at all 
government regulation  uncertainty of obtaining regulatory approval government regulation in the united states and other countries is a significant factor in the development  manufacturing and marketing of many of our products 
laserscope and its products are regulated in the united states by the fda under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act and the radiation control for health and safety act 
the fdc act provides two basic review procedures for medical devices 
certain products qualify for a section k k procedure under which the manufacturer gives the fda pre market notification of the manufacturer s intention to commence marketing the product 
the manufacturer must  among other things  establish that the product to be marketed is substantially equivalent to a previously marketed product 
in some cases  the manufacturer may be required to include clinical data gathered under an investigational device exemption ide granted by the fda allowing human clinical studies 
there can be no assurance that the fda will grant marketing clearance for our future products on a timely basis  or at all 
if the product does not qualify for the k procedure  the manufacturer must file a pre market approval application pma based on testing intended to demonstrate that the product is both safe and effective 
the pma requires more extensive clinical testing than the k procedure and generally involves a significantly longer fda review process 
approval of a pma allowing commercial sale of a product requires pre clinical laboratory and animal tests and human clinical studies conducted under an ide establishing safety and effectiveness 
generally  because of the amount of information required  the k procedure takes less time than the pma procedure 
to date  all of our products except for the series dye module have been marketed through the k procedure 
future products  however  may require clearance through the pma procedure 
there can be no assurance that such marketing clearances can be obtained on a timely basis  or at all 
delays in receiving such clearances could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to compete in our industry 
the fda may also require post market testing and surveillance programs to monitor certain products 
certain other countries require medical device manufacturers to obtain clearances for products prior to marketing the products in those countries 
the requirements vary widely from country to country and are subject to change 
we are also required to register with the fda and state agencies  such as the food and drug branch of the california department of health services cdhs  as a medical device manufacturer 
we are inspected routinely by these agencies to determine our compliance with the fda s current good manufacturing practice regulations 
those regulations impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon medical device manufacturers concerning manufacturing  testing and quality control activities 
if these inspections determine violations of applicable regulations  the continued marketing of any products manufactured by us may be adversely affected 
in addition  our laser products are covered by a performance standard for laser products set forth in fda regulations 
the laser performance standard imposes certain specific record keeping  reporting  product testing  and product labeling requirements on laser manufacturers 
these requirements also include affixing warning labels to laser systems  as well as incorporating certain safety features in the design of laser products 
complying with applicable governmental regulations and obtaining necessary clearances or approvals can be time consuming and expensive 
there can be no assurance that regulatory review will not involve delays or other actions adversely affecting the marketing and sale of our products 
we also cannot predict the extent or impact of future legislation or regulations 

table of contents we are also subject to regulation under federal and state laws regarding  among other things  occupational safety  the use and handling of hazardous materials and protection of the environment 
we believe that we are in material compliance with these requirements 
insurance reimbursement demand for certain of our products depends on government and private insurance reimbursement of hospitals and physicians for health care costs  including  but not limited to  reimbursement of capital equipment costs 
reductions or delays in such insurance coverage or reimbursement may negatively impact hospitals and physicians decisions to purchase our products  adversely affecting our future sales 
a substantial portion of our laser sales are for aesthetic procedures that are generally not subject to reimbursement by government or private health insurance 
the general absence of insurance coverage for these cosmetic procedures may restrict the development of this market 
in november  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms announced its final rule with respect to ambulatory payment classification apc reimbursement codes to be implemented in january one of the apc codes that was affected is currently being used by hospitals to bill medicare for the pvp procedures 
in february  cms issued a technical correction to this apc code which represents the reimbursement under this code for the reimbursement level to the hospital for this code was reduced approximately for the hospital site of service for medicare patients compared to the reimbursement during this reduction will likely have a short term adverse effect on the adoption and sales growth of the photo vaporization of the prostate pvp procedure in the united states as some hospital based customers who would normally consider adopting the pvp procedure delay their purchases or adoption until the reimbursement climate becomes more attractive 
in addition  there are no assurances that cms nor other reimbursement setting agencies will not change the classification of the pvp procedure to a reimbursement code or codes that further negatively impact the adoption of the procedure in either the hospital outpatient or other settings 
uncertainty of technological change  uncertainty of new product development and acceptance we operate in an industry that is subject to rapid technological change 
our ability to remain competitive and future operating results will depend upon  among other things  our ability to anticipate and respond rapidly to such change by developing  manufacturing and marketing technologically innovative products in sufficient quantities at acceptable costs to meet such demand 
as we introduce new products this may cause some of our existing products to become obsolete  which may result in the write off of inventory 
however  without new products and enhancements  our existing products will likely become obsolete due to technological advances by other companies  which could result in the write off of inventory as well as diminished revenues 
therefore  we intend to continue to invest significant amounts in research and development 
our expenditures for research and development were million in each of and and million in we anticipate that our ability to compete will require significant research and development expenditures with a continuing flow of innovative  high quality products 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in designing  manufacturing or selling enhanced or new products in a timely manner 
nor can we assure that a competitor could not introduce a new or enhanced product or technology that could have an adverse effect on our competitive position 
our current research and development programs are directed toward the development of new laser systems and delivery devices 
we cannot assure that these markets will develop as anticipated or that our product development efforts will prove successful 
nor can we assure that such new products  if developed and introduced  will be accepted by the market 

table of contents dependence on single source suppliers and certain third parties certain of the components used in our laser products  including certain optical components  are purchased from single sources 
while we believe that most of these components are available from alternate sources  an interruption of these or other supplies could adversely affect our ability to manufacture lasers 
competition we compete in the non ophthalmic surgical segment of the worldwide medical laser market 
in this market  lasers are used in hospital operating rooms  outpatient surgery centers and individual physician offices for a wide variety of procedures 
this market is highly competitive 
our competitors are numerous and include some of the world s largest organizations as well as smaller  highly specialized firms 
our ability to compete effectively depends on such factors as market acceptance of our products  product performance  price  customer support  the success and timing of new product development  and continued development of successful distribution channels 
some of our current and prospective competitors have or may have significantly greater financial  technical  research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources than we have 
in  two of our largest competitors  esc medical systems esc and coherent medical  completed a business combination 
to compete effectively  we will need to continue to expand our product offerings  periodically enhance our existing products and continue to enhance our distribution 
certain surgical laser manufacturers have targeted their efforts on narrow segments of the market  such as angioplasty and lithotripsy 
their products may compete for the same capital equipment funds as our products  and accordingly  these manufacturers may be considered our competitors 
generally  surgical laser manufacturers such as laserscope compete with standard surgical methods and other medical technologies and treatment modalities 
we cannot assure that we can compete effectively against such competitors 
in addition  we cannot assure that these or other companies will not succeed in developing technologies  products or treatments that are more effective than ours or that would render our technology or products obsolete or non competitive 
reliance on patents and licenses we hold several patents issued in the united states  generally covering surgical laser systems  delivery devices  calibration inserts and the laser resonator 
we have also licensed certain technologies from others 
we cannot assure that any patents or licenses that we hold or that may be issued as a result of our patent applications will provide any competitive advantages for our products 
nor can we assure that any of the patents that we now hold or may hold in the future will not be successfully challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
in addition  we cannot assure that competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  will not seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  issue  use and sell our products 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we believe that we own or have the right to use the basic patents covering our products 
however  the laser industry is characterized by a very large number of patents  many of which are of questionable validity and some of which appear to overlap with other issued patents 
as a result  there is a significant amount of uncertainty in the industry regarding patent protection and infringement 
because patent applications are maintained in secrecy in the united states until such patents are issued and are maintained in secrecy for a 
table of contents period of time outside the united states  we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology infringes any patents or patent applications of others 
failure to attract or retain key personnel can adversely affect results we depend upon the efforts and abilities of a number of current key personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain key employees it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and future cash flows 
reliance on key customers in december  laserscope and mckesson corporation mckesson entered into a five year agreement whereby mckesson would obtain exclusive distribution rights for the company s aesthetic product lines to doctors offices in the united states 
during  aesthetic product sales in the united states accounted for approximately of our total revenues and at december   accounts receivable from mckesson accounted for approximately of our total accounts receivable 
if we are unable to maintain a favorable relationship with mckesson or if mckesson encounters financial difficulties  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and future cashflows 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results a number of factors affect our quarterly financial results including the timing of shipments and orders 
our laser products are relatively expensive pieces of medical capital equipment and the precise shipment date of specific units can have a marked effect on our results of operations on a quarterly basis 
any delay in product shipments near the end of a quarter could cause our quarterly results to fall short of anticipated levels 
furthermore  to the extent we receive orders near the end of a quarter  we may not be able to fulfill the order during the balance of that same quarter 
moreover  we typically receive a disproportionate percentage of orders toward the end of each quarter 
to the extent that we do not receive anticipated orders or orders are delayed beyond the end of the applicable quarter  our results may be adversely affected and may be unpredictable from quarter to quarter 
in addition  because a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter result from orders received in that quarter  we base our production  inventory and operating expenditure levels on anticipated revenue levels 
thus  if sales do not occur when expected  expenditure levels could be disproportionately high and operating results for that quarter and potentially future quarters  would be adversely affected 
we cannot assure that laserscope will accomplish revenue growth or profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
nor can we assure that revenue growth or profitability will not fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
potential of product defects laser systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance 
the manufacture of our lasers  laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process 
as a result of the technical complexity of our products  changes in our or our suppliers manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability 
to the extent that we do not achieve such yields or product reliability  our business  operating results  financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected 
our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions 
in addition some of our products are combined with products from other vendors  which may contain defects 
as a result  should problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
if we are unable to fix defects or other problems  we could experience  among other things loss of customers  increased costs of product  returns and warranty expenses  damage to our brand reputation  
table of contents failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development and engineering resources  and legal actions by our customers 
the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
product liability risk  limited insurance coverage our business has significant risks of product liability claims 
we have experienced product liability claims from time to time  which we believe are ordinary for our business 
while we cannot predict or determine the outcome of the actions brought against us  we believe that these actions will not ultimately have a material adverse impact on laserscope s financial position  results of operations  and future cash flows 
at present  we maintain product liability insurance on a claims made basis with coverage of million in the aggregate with a deductible of million per occurrence and an annual maximum aggregate deductible of million 
we cannot assure that such insurance coverage will be available to us in the future at a reasonable cost  if at all 
nor can we assure that other claims will not be brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage 
natural catastrophic events  terrorism and other manmade problems our corporate headquarters  including our research and development operations  our manufacturing facilities  and our principal sales  marketing and service offices  are located in the silicon valley area of northern california  a region known for seismic activity 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake or a flood  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  the effects of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks in new york and washington  dc on september  disrupted commerce throughout the world and intensified the uncertainty of the us and other economies 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to these economies and create further uncertainties 
to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  or the manufacture or shipment of our products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
factors affecting financial results and stock price a number of factors affect our financial results and stock price including  but not limited to product mix  competitive pricing pressures  material costs  revenue and expenses related to new products and enhancements to existing products  delays in customer purchases in anticipation of new products or product enhancements by laserscope or its competitors  and the risk of loss or interruption to our operations or increased costs due to earthquakes  the availability of power and energy supplies and other events beyond our control 
the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to laserscope  such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results  changes in analysts estimates of future results  changes in investors perceptions of our products  
table of contents announcement of new or enhanced products by us or our competitors  announcements relating to acquisitions and strategic transactions by us or our competitors  general conditions in the medical equipment industry  and general conditions in the financial markets 
the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly among stocks of high technology companies  which  on occasion  have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
factors not directly related to laserscope s performance  such as negative industry reports or disappointing earnings announcements by publicly traded competitors  may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
as of march   we had  shares of outstanding common stock 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
international business our international revenues were of total revenues in the year ended december   compared to of total revenues during the comparable period in our international sales are made through international distributors and wholly owned subsidiaries with payments to us typically denominated in the local currencies of the united kingdom and france  and in us dollars in the rest of the world 
we intend to continue our operations outside of the united states and potentially to enter additional international markets 
these activities  require significant management attention and financial resources and further subject us to the risks of operating internationally 
these risks include  but are not limited to changes in regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  customs  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
we are also subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with our international operations  such as differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships and war 
in addition  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our ability to compete in terms of price against products denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these regulatory  geopolitical and other factors 
we do not engage in hedging transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
legal proceedings laserscope is a party to a number of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
while it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of the actions brought against us  we believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims will not ultimately have a material adverse effect on laserscope s financial position  results of operations  or future cash flows 
interest rate risk laserscope s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our outstanding debt 
in   and we did not use derivative financial instruments 
we invest excess cash in money market funds 
our debt financing consists of convertible debentures and bank loans requiring either fixed or variable rate interest payments 
investments in and borrowings under both fixed rate and floating rate interest 
table of contents earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
on the investment side  fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
in addition  our future investment income may fall short of securities analyst expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
on the debt side  borrowings that require fixed rate interest payments require greater than current market rate interest payments if interest rates fall  while floating rate borrowings may require greater interest payments if interest rates rise 
additionally  our future interest expense may be greater than expected due to changes in interest rates 
warranty obligations we have a direct field service organization that provides service for our products 
we generally provide a twelve month warranty on our laser systems 
after the warranty period  maintenance and support is provided on a service contract basis or on an individual call basis 
our warranties and premium service contracts provide for a uptime guarantee on our laser systems 
under provisions of this guarantee  we extend the term of the related warranty or service contract if specified system uptime levels are not maintained 
although most systems covered by this guarantee have achieved a uptime rate to date  we cannot assure that we can maintain such uptime rates in the future 
no dividends we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future 
the payment of dividends on the common stock will depend on our earnings  financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant 
penny stock rules our common stock is traded on the national association of securities dealers automated quotation nasdaq national market system  which requires that a company have a minimum bid price of in order to qualify for continued listing 
our low bid price in for each of the quarters march  june  september and december was   and  respectively  and our last traded price on march  was 
if we fail to maintain our listing for our common stock on the nasdaq national market system  and no other exclusion from the definition of penny stock under the exchange act is available  any brokers engaging in transactions in our securities would be required to provide their customers with a risk disclosure document  the compensation of the broker dealer in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market values of our securities held in the customers accounts 
the bid and offer quotations and compensation information must be provided prior to effecting the transaction and must be contained on the customer s confirmation 
if brokers become subject to the penny stock rules when engaging in transactions in our securities  they would become less willing to engage in such transactions  thereby making it more difficult for shareholders to dispose of their shares of laserscope common stock 
dilution shareholders may experience dilution in the net tangible book value of their investment upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants granted under laserscope s stock option plans and other options  warrants and outstanding convertible securities
