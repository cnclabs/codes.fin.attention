item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nuevo energy is engaged in the acquisition  exploitation  development  exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas 
our core areas in the us are onshore and offshore california and west texas 
we also have international crude oil production in the republic of congo 
the following review should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
in september  we acquired athanor resources  inc athanor 
effective september   the results of athanor s operations are included in the consolidated financial statements 
the purchase price totaling approximately million was comprised of a combination of million of available cash and additional borrowings  the issuance of approximately million of our common stock to athanor stockholders  and the assumption of net liabilities with a fair value of approximately million 
the allocation of the purchase price resulted in the allocation of approximately million to goodwill 
results of operations our results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
the following table reflects our production and average prices for oil and natural gas year ended december  crude oil and liquids sales volumes mbbls d domestic international total sales prices bbl unhedged hedged revenues thousands domestic    international    marketing fees  hedging    total    natural gas sales volumes mmcf d domestic sales prices mcf unhedged hedged n a n a revenues thousands domestic    hedging marketing fees total    lease operating costs per boe domestic international total year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had net income of million  or per diluted share for as compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share in revenues oil and gas revenues 
oil and gas revenues were million in compared to million in principally due to lower natural gas prices which were partially offset by higher crude oil prices realized  lower hedging losses and higher crude oil and natural gas production 
the realized oil price in was per bbl  an increase of per bbl from crude oil production averaged mbbls day in  an increase of mbbls day from the increased production was due to higher production at point pedernales and santa clara due to improved performance which was partially offset by lower production at cymric where production was curtailed for well repairs 
we had a hedging loss of million in compared to a hedging loss of million in natural gas production averaged mmcf per day in  an increase of from mmcf per day in primarily due to production from the pakenham field acquired in september the realized natural gas price in was per mcf  which decreased from per mcf in other revenue 
other revenue of million in was million higher than principally due to million of business interruption insurance recoveries received in  related to the repair of our pipelines at the point pedernales field 
costs and expenses costs and expenses 
lease operating expenses loe of million in decreased from we use gas as a feedstock to generate steam which is injected into reservoirs to facilitate the production of heavy california oil 
excluding the cost of steam used in our oil production operations  loe decreased in compared to exploration costs of million in were million lower than million in the exploration costs included a million non cash write off the anaguid permit in tunisia which was conveyed to third parties while the costs included million of dry hole costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a was million in compared to million in the prior year primarily due to higher production and a higher dd a rate 
the dd a rate was per boe in compared to per boe in due to lower outsourcing costs  legal fees and project costs  general and administrative expense of million in was million lower than we had no impairments in compared to million in the impairment in was on our santa clara  huntington beach  pitas point  masseko congo and point pedernales fields and certain other oil and gas properties 
in  there were no restructuring and severance charges as compared to million in the restructuring charges were related to the termination of two outsourcing contracts and the reorganization of our exploration and production operations 
other expenses were million in compared to million in which included the termination of hedging contracts with enron and various consulting and legal costs 
loss on assets held for sale 
in  we made the decision to sell certain real estate in california 
accordingly  we transferred the underlying net book value of this real estate to assets held for sale and recorded a million loss  representing the write down to its estimated fair market value  less costs to sell 
in  we made the decision not to proceed with our power plant project in santa barbara and kern county california and transferred our remaining equipment to assets held for sale and recorded a million loss representing the write down to estimated fair market value less estimated costs to sell these assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
gain on disposition of properties 
our net gain from the sales of assets for of million was primarily related to the settlement agreement with exxonmobil  where we conveyed to them our interest in the santa ynez unit  our non consent interest in the adjacent pescado field and relinquished our right to participate in the sacate field  all of which were unproved properties 
in  the gain on disposition of properties of million is primarily related to the gain of million from our sale of a parcel of real estate in brea  california 
derivative gain loss 
our derivative loss was million in compared to a gain of million in the derivative loss in includes mark to market losses on derivatives which did not qualify as hedges and ineffectiveness on hedges 
interest expense 
interest expense of million in decreased compared to interest expense of million in due to the benefit of our interest rate swaps in of million 
dividends 
dividends on the tecons were million in and the tecons pay dividends at a rate of 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income tax 
we had income tax expense of million including current tax of million in compared to a tax benefit of million in which had no current tax 
the current tax relates to california state income tax which deferred the use of net operating losses for two years 
our effective income tax rate was in and in discontinued operations 
we had a loss from discontinued operations of million in compared to income of million in in  we sold our properties located in texas  alabama and louisiana eastern properties for approximately million and recognized a million after tax loss 
we also made the decision to sell our brea olinda field in california in and recognized a million loss in connection with writing down the associated assets to their estimated fair value less our costs to sell them 
in the income from discontinued operations consists of after tax operating income from our eastern properties and brea olinda field 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had a net loss of million for  or per diluted share as compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in revenues oil and gas revenues 
oil and gas revenues increased to million in from million in principally due to higher commodity prices and lower hedging losses during  partially offset by lower production 
the realized oil price in was per bbl  an increase of per bbl from crude oil production averaged mbbls day  a decrease of mbbls day due to an eight month curtailment of steaming operations in california as well as production shut ins for facility repairs in our hedging losses were million in and million in natural gas production averaged mmcf per day in  declining from mmcf per day in the decline was due to lower domestic production offshore california 
the realized natural gas price was per mcf  which increased from per mcf in costs and expenses costs and expenses 
loe for totaled million  as compared to million for the increase in loe from to is primarily due to a increase in gas prices in compared to we use gas as a feedstock to generate steam which is injected into reservoirs to facilitate the production of heavy california oil 
exploration costs  including geological and geophysical costs  dry hole costs and delay rentals  were million in  an increase of million from  primarily due to million of dry hole costs associated with non commercial wells drilled onshore california and certain international properties 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased in to million due to higher depletion rates which were primarily driven by a lower reserve base 
general and administrative expense of million in was million higher than primarily due to higher investment advisory fees 
impairments of oil and gas properties 
during  we recorded an impairment totaling million on our santa clara  huntington beach  pitas point  masseko congo and point pedernales fields and certain other oil and gas properties 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires an impairment loss be recognized when the carrying value of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows 
we recognized an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets 
we had no impairments in see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements

we incurred million of restructuring and severance charges in related to the termination of two outsourcing contracts and the reorganization of our exploration and production operations 
these costs included termination fees and severance 
we had no such costs in see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
loss on assets held for sale 
in  we made the decision not to proceed with our power plant project in santa barbara and kern county  california and transferred our remaining equipment to assets held for sale and recorded a million loss representing the write down to estimated fair market value less estimated costs to sell these assets 
we had no such costs in see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other expenses 
other expenses were million in increased million from principally due to the termination of hedging contracts with enron and various consulting and legal costs 
gain on disposition of properties 
our net gain from the sales of assets for was million  primarily related to the million gain from our sale of real estate in brea  california 
the net gain on sale of assets for was million primarily representing a million gain on the sale of our working interest in the las cienegas field in california 
interest income and interest expense 
interest income for of million was earned on the overnight investment of excess cash 
interest income for of million resulted from higher cash balances in interest expense of million in increased compared to interest expense of million in the increase is primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of interest for our senior subordinated notes issued in september  offset by a decrease in the use of a line of credit and an increase of interest capitalized 
dividends 
dividends on the tecons were million in and the tecons pay dividends at a rate of 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements

we had income from discontinued operations of million in compared to income of million in this represents our operating income from the eastern properties sold in and the brea olinda field sold in capital resources and liquidity we have grown and diversified our operations through low cost acquisitions of oil and gas properties and the subsequent exploitation and development of these properties 
we have historically funded our operations and acquisitions with operating cash flows  bank financing  private and public placements of debt and equity securities  property divestitures and joint ventures with industry participants 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and we invested million  million and million in oil and gas properties in  and additionally  we spent million  million  and million on other properties in  and in  we acquired athanor resources  inc for approximately million including million of available cash

we are not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to these notes 
the notes are unsecured general obligations  and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness 
in the event of a defined change in control  we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
notes due in july  we authorized a new issuance of million of senior subordinated notes due june  in august  we exchanged million of our notes due and million of our senior subordinated notes due in connection with the exchange offers  we solicited consents to proposed amendments to the indentures under which the exchanged notes were issued

these notes have not been redeemed  in whole or in part  at december  we are not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to these notes and they are unsecured general obligations  and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness 
operating leases we have operating leases in the normal course of business  which include those for office space and operating facilities and office and operating equipment  with varying terms from to at december   our total commitments under operating leases were approximately million 
minimum annual rental commitments at december   were as follows operating leases in thousands thereafter  total  capital commitments at december   we had capital commitments of million relating to our international oil and gas exploration and development activity 
in early  we fulfilled this obligation 
our other planned capital projects are discretionary in nature  with no substantial capital commitments made in advance of the actual expenditures 
commercial commitments the following table summarizes our commercial commitments by date of expiration 
each of these commitments is discussed in further detail below amount of commitment expiration per period total amount less than after committed year years years years in thousands bank credit facility   letters of credit total commercial commitments   lines of credit bank credit facility 
our third amended and restated credit agreement  dated june   provides for secured revolving credit availability of up to million and issuance of letters of credit from a bank group led by bank of america  na  bank one  na  and bank of montreal until its expiration on june availability under the credit facility is determined pursuant to a semi annual borrowing base determination which establishes the maximum borrowings that may be outstanding under the credit facility 
the borrowing base is determined by a vote of participant banks two thirds in the event of an increase in the borrowing base  each of which bases its judgement on i the present value of our oil and gas reserves based on their own assumptions regarding future prices  production  costs  risk factors and discount rates  and ii projected cash flow coverage ratios calculated under varying scenarios 
if amounts outstanding under the credit facility exceed the borrowing base  as redetermined from time to time  we would be required to repay such excess over a defined period of time 
we have a million borrowing base under our credit facility with million available at december  and had drawn million under the agreement 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the london interbank offered rate libor plus an amount which varies according to our indebtedness to capitalization ratio as defined under the credit agreement 
letters of credits we had one letter of credit outstanding at december  in the amount of million  which expires in august critical accounting policies and estimates oil and gas properties we use the successful efforts method to account for our investments in oil and gas properties 
under the successful efforts method  oil and gas lease acquisition costs and intangible drilling costs associated with exploration efforts that result in the discovery of proved reserves and costs associated with development drilling  whether or not successful  are capitalized when incurred 
when a proved property is sold  ceases to produce or is abandoned  a gain or loss is recognized 
when an entire interest in an unproved property is sold for cash or cash equivalent  a gain or loss is recognized  taking into consideration any recorded impairment 
when a partial interest in an unproved property is sold  the amount received is treated as a reduction of the cost of the interest retained 
costs of successful wells  development dry holes and proved leases are capitalized and depleted on a unit of production basis over the remaining proved reserves 
capitalized drilling costs are depleted on a unit of production basis over the lives of the remaining proved developed reserves 
total estimated costs of million for future dismantlement  abandonment and site remediation are included when calculating depreciation and depletion using the unit of production method 
through december   we had recorded million as a component of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization related to this future obligation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the provisions of sfas no 
 which will be adopted effective january  in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
the standard also expanded the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
we adopted the provisions of this statement effective january  and have presented certain property dispositions as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review our long lived assets to be held and used  including proved oil and gas properties accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting  on a depletable unit basis whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
sfas no 
requires an impairment loss to be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows and we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is estimated to be the expected present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves  utilizing a risk free rate of return 
during  we recorded an impairment totaling million on our santa clara  huntington beach  pitas point  masseko congo and point pedernales fields and certain other oil and gas properties 
we recorded no impairments in and only those required to be taken for the assets designated as held for sale in also  in accordance with sfas no 
 when the proved properties are classified as held for sale  if the carrying amount of the assets is less than their fair market value less our estimated costs to sell them  the difference is recognized as a loss in that period and  if significant  the associated results of operations are accounted for as discontinued 
unproved leasehold costs are capitalized pending the results of exploration efforts 
significant unproved leasehold costs are reviewed periodically and a loss is recognized to the extent  if any  that the cost of the property has been impaired 
exploration costs  including geological and geophysical expenses  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are charged to expense as incurred 
during and  interest costs associated with non producing leases and exploration and development projects were capitalized only for the period that activities were in progress to bring these projects to their intended use 
the capitalization rates were based on our weighted average cost of funds used to finance expenditures 
we capitalized million and million of interest costs in and there were no interest costs capitalized in recognition of crude oil and natural gas revenue crude oil and natural gas revenue is recognized when title passes to the purchaser 
we use the entitlement method for recording sales of crude oil and natural gas from producing wells 
under the entitlement method  revenue is recorded based on our net revenue interest in production 
deliveries of crude oil and natural gas in excess of our net revenue interests are recorded as liabilities and under deliveries are recorded as assets 
production imbalances are recorded at the lower of the sales price in effect at the time of production or the current market value 
substantially all such amounts are anticipated to be settled with production in future periods 
we did not have a material imbalance position in terms of units or value at december  or derivative financial instruments and price risk management activities we use price risk management activities to manage non trading market risks 
we use derivative financial instruments such as swaps  collars and options to hedge the impact market price risk exposures on our crude oil and natural gas production  natural gas purchases and to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk 
we account for derivatives under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and have elected to designate derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges for commodity related contracts and fair value hedges for interest rate contracts 
goodwill and other intangible assets in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires discontinuing amortization of goodwill after and requires that goodwill be tested for impairment 
the impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to business levels referred to as reporting units 
the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill is determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value including goodwill  then a second test is performed to determine the amount of the impairment 
if the second test is necessary  the fair value of the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities is deducted from the fair value of the reporting unit 
this difference represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the book value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
any excess of the book value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill is the amount of the impairment 
the goodwill impairment test is performed annually  in the fourth quarter and also at interim dates upon the occurrence of significant events 
significant events include a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold  significant adverse trends in current and future oil and gas prices  nationalization of any of the company s oil and gas properties  or  significant increases in a reporting unit s carrying value relative to its fair value 
we adopted the provisions of this statement on january  we recorded million of goodwill in connection with our acquisition of athanor resources  inc see note 
the goodwill is recorded in our domestic reporting unit 
the annual impairment test will be performed in the fourth quarter of each year  or more often if required 
oil and gas reserves there are uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserve quantities  projecting future production rates and projecting the timing of future development expenditures 
in addition  reserve estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of properties with a production history 
accordingly  these estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  condensate and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at the end of the respective years 
proved developed reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered through existing equipment and operating methods 
new accounting pronouncements accounting for asset retirement obligations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement requires companies to record a liability relating to the eventual retirement and removal of assets used in their business 
the liability is discounted to its present value  with a corresponding increase to the related asset value 
over the life of the asset  the liability will be accreted to its future value and eventually extinguished when the asset is taken out of service 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  in connection with the initial application of sfas no 
 it is expected we will record a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of taxes  of approximately million to million as an increase to net income  which will be reflected in our results of operations for in addition  it is expected we will record an asset retirement obligation of approximately million to million 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others  which clarifies the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to a guarantor s accounting for and disclosures of certain guarantees issued 
fin requires enhanced disclosures for certain guarantees 
it also will require certain guarantees that are issued or modified after december   including certain third party guarantees  to be initially recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
for guarantees issued on or before december   liabilities are recorded when and if payments become probable and estimable 
the financial statement recognition provisions are effective prospectively  and we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of fin until guarantees are issued or modified in future periods  at which time their results will be initially reported in the financial statements 
contingencies and other matters on december   a lawsuit was filed by hills for everyone  a non profit corporation  against orange county and nuevo energy company challenging the adequacy of the environment impact report for the company s tonner hills project 
the suit seeks to compel orange county to set aside its decision to adopt the environment impact report and seeks additional environmental analysis and mitigation measures 
the company is contesting the litigation and both the county and the company are continuing to take the necessary regulatory steps to move the project toward development 
on september   during an annual inspection  we discovered fractures in the heat affected zone of certain flanges on our pipeline that connects the point pedernales field with onshore processing facilities 
we voluntarily elected to shut in production in the field while repairs were being made 
the daily net production from this field was approximately  barrels of crude oil and mmcf of natural gas  representing approximately of our daily production 
we replaced the damaged flanges  as well as others which had not shown signs of damage 
we resumed production in january during the third quarter we reached a final agreement with our underwriters with respect to our business interruption claim 
accordingly  we recognized million of business interruption recoveries during the third quarter which is classified in other revenue and received payment on this claim by year end certain other costs related to repair are expected to be covered by insurance based on a tentative agreement we have with our underwriters 
we expect payment with respect to the repair claims in the next nine months once the claims are fully adjusted 
on june   we experienced a failure of a carbon dioxide treatment vessel at the rincon onshore separation facility rosf located in ventura county  california 
there were no injuries associated with this event 
crude oil and natural gas produced from three fields offshore california are transported onshore by pipeline to the rosf plant where crude oil and water are separated and treated  and carbon dioxide is removed from the natural gas stream 
the daily net production associated with these fields was  barrels of crude oil and mmcf of natural gas in  representing approximately of our daily production 
in early july  crude oil production resumed and full gas sales resumed by mid august the cost of repair  less a  deductible  is expected to be covered by insurance 
we expect to settle the insurance claims within the next six months 
on september   we were named as a defendant in the lawsuit thomas wachtell et al 
versus nuevo energy company in the superior court of los angeles county  california 
we settled this lawsuit in june for  among other matters  making a payment to plaintiffs of million  and receiving from plaintiffs certain interests in properties and extinguishing certain contract rights of plaintiffs 
we established a reserve for this contingency in and the settlement payment in did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
on april   we filed a lawsuit against exxonmobil corporation in the united states district court for the central district of california  western division 
we and exxonmobil each owned a interest in the sacate field  offshore santa barbara county  california 
we believe that we had been denied a reasonable opportunity to exercise our rights under the unit operating agreement 
we alleged that exxonmobil s actions breached the unit operating agreement and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
we settled this lawsuit in june under the terms of the settlement agreement  we received million from exxonmobil and conveyed to them our interest in the santa ynez unit  our non consent interest in the adjacent pescado field and relinquished our right to participate in the sacate field and recorded a million gain related to the sale of this unproved property 
in september  there was a spill of crude oil into the santa barbara channel from a pipeline that connects our point pedernales field with shore based processing facilities 
the volume of the spill was estimated to be bbls of oil 
repairs were completed by the end of  and production recommenced in december the costs of the clean up and the cost to repair the pipeline either have been or are expected to be covered by our insurance  less a deductible of million 
as of december   we had received insurance reimbursements of million  with a remaining insurance receivable of million 
costs related to the settlement of claims for natural resource damage asserted by certain federal and state agencies are also expected to be covered by insurance 
our international investments involve risks typically associated with investments in emerging markets such as an uncertain political  economic  legal and tax environment and expropriation and nationalization of assets 
in addition  if a dispute arises in our foreign operations  we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the united states 
we attempt to conduct our business and financial affairs to protect against political and economic risks applicable to operations in the various countries where we operate  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in so protecting ourselves 
a portion of our investment in the congo is insured through political risk insurance provided by overseas private investment company opic 
the political risk insurance through opic covers up to million relating to expropriation and political violence  which is the maximum coverage available through opic 
during  a new government was established in the congo 
although the political situation in the congo has not to date had a material adverse effect on our operations in the congo  no assurances can be made that continued political unrest in west africa will not have a material adverse effect on us or our operations in the congo in the future 
in connection with our february acquisitions of two subsidiaries owning interests in the yombo field offshore congo  we and a wholly owned subsidiary of cms nomeco oil gas co 
cms agreed with the seller of the subsidiaries not to claim certain tax losses dual consolidated losses incurred by such subsidiaries prior to the acquisitions 
under the tax law in the congo  as it existed when this acquisition took place  if an entity is acquired in its entirety and that entity has certain tax attributes  for example tax loss carryforwards from operations in the republic of congo  the subsequent owners of that entity can continue to utilize those losses without restriction 
pursuant to the agreement  we and cms may be liable to the seller for the recapture of dual consolidated losses net operating losses of any domestic corporation that are subject to an income tax of a foreign country without regard to the source of its income or on a residence basis utilized by the seller in years prior to the acquisitions if certain triggering events occur  including i a disposition by either us or cms of its respective congo subsidiary  ii either congo subsidiary s sale of its interest in the yombo field  iii the acquisition of us or cms by another consolidated group or iv the failure of cms s congo subsidiary or us to continue as a member of its respective consolidated group 
a triggering event will not occur  however  if a subsequent purchaser enters into certain agreements specified in the consolidated return regulations intended to ensure that such dual consolidated losses will not be claimed 
the only time limit associated with the occurrence of a triggering event relates to the utilization of a dual consolidated loss in a foreign jurisdiction 
a dual consolidated loss that is utilized to offset income in a foreign jurisdiction is only subject to recapture for years following the year in which the dual consolidated loss was incurred for us income tax purposes 
we and cms have agreed among ourselves that the party responsible for the triggering event shall indemnify the other for any liability to the seller as a result of such triggering event 
our potential direct liability could be as much as million if a triggering event with respect to us occurs 
additionally  we believe that cms s liability for which we would be jointly liable with an indemnification right against cms could be as much as million 
cms sold their interest in the yombo field in  to a us subsidiary of perenco  us perenco  which is awaiting the approval from the government of congo 
the sale was not a triggering event as both cms and perenco filed a request for a closing agreement with the internal revenue service in accordance with the us consolidated tax return regulations prior to the sale 
further  we do not expect a triggering event to occur with respect to nuevo  cms or perenco  and do not believe the agreement will have a material adverse effect upon us 
in  the congo government requested that the convention governing the marine i exploitation permit be converted to a production sharing agreement psa 
we are under no obligation to convert to a psa  and our existing convention is valid and protected by law 
our position is that any conversion to a psa should have no detrimental impact to us  otherwise  we will not agree to any such conversion 
discussions with the government have been ongoing intermittently since early to date  no final agreement has been reached concerning conversion to a psa 
we have been named as a defendant in certain other lawsuits incidental to our business 
these actions and claims in the aggregate seek damages against us and are subject to the inherent uncertainties in any litigation 
we are defending ourselves vigorously in all such matters 
we have reserved an amount that we deem adequate to cover any potential losses related to these matters to the extent the losses are deemed probable and estimable 
this amount is reviewed periodically and changes may be made  as appropriate 
any additional costs related to these potential losses are not expected to be material to our operating results  financial condition or liquidity 
contingent payment and price sharing agreements in connection with the acquisition from unocal in of the properties located in california  we are obligated to make a contingent payment for the years through if oil prices exceed thresholds set forth in the agreement with unocal 
contingent payments are accounted for as a purchase price adjustment to oil and gas properties 
the contingent payment will equal of the difference between the actual average annual price received on a field by field basis capped by a maximum price and a minimum price  less ad valorem and production taxes  and certain other permitted deductions  multiplied by the actual number of barrels of oil sold that are produced from the properties acquired from unocal during the respective year 
the minimum price of per bbl under the agreement determined based on the near month delivery of wti crude oil on the nymex is escalated at per year and the maximum price of per bbl on the nymex is escalated at per year 
minimum and maximum prices are reduced to reflect the field level price by subtracting a fixed differential established for each field 
the reduction was established at approximately the differential between actual sales prices and nymex prices in effect in per bbl weighted average for all the properties acquired from unocal 
we accumulate credits to offset the contingent payment when prices are per bbl or more below the minimum price 
on march   we paid million to unocal attributable to calendar year and recorded the payment in oil and gas properties 
in march  we advised unocal that we had failed to take deductions to the purchase price that we believe are permitted by the agreement 
application of these deductions resulted in no payment due for either calendar year or  and resulted in a credit being available to use against future obligations 
unocal disputes this position 
discussions are taking place between the companies in an effort to resolve this issue for both years 
while the final outcome of this matter is not presently determinable  its resolution is not expected to have a significant impact on our operating results  financial condition or liquidity 
in connection with the acquisition of the congo properties in  we entered into a price sharing agreement with the seller 
under the terms of the agreement  if the average price received for the oil production during the year is greater than the benchmark price established by the agreement  we are obligated to pay the seller of the difference between the benchmark price and the actual price received  for all the production associated with this acquisition 
the benchmark price was per bbl for  per bbl for and per bbl for the benchmark price increases each year  based on the increase in the consumer price index 
for  the effect of this agreement was that we only owned upside above per bbl on approximately of our congo production 
we were obligated to pay the seller million in  million in and million in under this price sharing agreement 
because there is no termination date associated with this agreement  it is accounted for as an oil royalty 
we acquired a working interest in the point pedernales oil field from unocal in and the remainder of our working interest from torch in we are entitled to all revenue proceeds up to per bbl  with the excess revenue over per bbl  if any  shared with the original owners from whom torch acquired its interest 
we own amounts below per bbl with the other working interest owners based on their respective ownership interests 
for  the effect of this agreement is that we were entitled to receive the pricing upside above per bbl on approximately of the gross point pedernales production 
as of december   we had million accrued as our obligation under this agreement

the cautionary statements expressly qualify all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf 
volatility of oil and gas prices prices for oil and gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
these factors include but are not limited to weather conditions in the united states  the condition of the united states economy  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec  governmental regulation  political stability in the middle east and elsewhere  the foreign supply of oil and gas  the price of foreign oil imports and the availability of alternate fuel sources and transportation interruption 
any substantial and extended decline in the price of oil or gas would have an adverse effect on the carrying value of our proved reserves  borrowing capacity  our ability to obtain additional capital  and our revenues  profitability and cash flows from operations 
volatile oil and gas prices make it difficult to estimate the value of producing properties for acquisition and divestiture and often cause disruption in the market for oil and gas producing properties  as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on such value 
price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on acquisitions and development and exploitation projects 
pricing of heavy oil production a portion of our production is california heavy oil 
the market price for california heavy oil differs substantially from the established market indices for oil and gas  principally due to the higher transportation and refining costs associated with heavy oil 
as a result  the price received for heavy oil is generally lower than the price for medium and light oil  and the production costs associated with heavy oil are relatively higher than for lighter grades 
the margin sales price minus production costs on heavy oil sales is generally less than that of lighter oil  and the effect of material price decreases will more adversely affect the profitability of heavy oil production compared with lighter grades of oil 
see risk management and hedging policy below for discussion of our crude oil sales contract which expires in 
reserve replacement risks our future performance depends upon the ability to find  develop and acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
without successful exploration  exploitation or acquisition activities  our reserves and revenues will decline 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to find and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost 
the successful acquisition and development of oil and gas properties requires an assessment of recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices and operating costs  potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors 
such assessments are necessarily inexact and their accuracy inherently uncertain 
in addition  no assurances can be given that our exploitation and development activities will result in any increase in reserves 
our operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of lack of adequate capital and other factors  such as title problems  weather  compliance with governmental regulations or price controls  mechanical difficulties or shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment 
in addition  the costs of exploitation and development may materially exceed initial estimates 
substantial capital requirements we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures for the exploitation  exploration  acquisition and production of oil and gas reserves 
historically  these expenditures were financed with cash generated by operations  proceeds from bank borrowings and the proceeds of debt and equity issuances 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our bank credit facility to fund planned capital expenditures 
if revenues or our borrowing base decrease as a result of lower oil and gas prices  operating difficulties or declines in reserves  we may have limited ability to expend the capital necessary to undertake or complete future drilling programs 
there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing or cash generated by operations will be available to meet these requirements 
uncertainty of estimates of reserves and future net cash flows estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  all of which are to some degree speculative and may vary considerably from actual results 
therefore  actual production  revenues  taxes  and development and operating expenditures may not occur as estimated 
future results of operations will depend upon our ability to develop  produce and sell our oil and gas reserves 
the reserve data included herein are estimates only and are subject to many uncertainties 
actual quantities of oil and gas may differ considerably from the amounts set forth herein 
in addition  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and cash flows based upon the same available data 
operating risks our operations are subject to risks inherent in the oil and gas industry  such as blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  fires  pollution  earthquakes and other environmental risks 
these risks could result in substantial losses due to injury and loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage and suspension of operations 
our offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment  such as hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions  to more extensive governmental regulation  including regulations that may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for pollution damage  and to interruption or termination of operations by governmental authorities based on environmental or other considerations 
our operations could result in liability for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages 
we could be liable for environmental damages caused by previous property owners 
as a result  substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred  the payment of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain insurance coverage for our operations  including limited coverage for sudden environmental damages and for existing contamination  but do not believe that insurance coverage for environmental damages that occur over time or insurance coverage for the full potential liability that could be caused by sudden environmental damages is available at a reasonable cost  and we may be subject to liability or may lose substantial portions of our properties in the event of certain environmental damages 
foreign investments our foreign investments involve risks typically associated with investments in emerging markets such as uncertain political  economic  legal and tax environments and expropriation and nationalization of assets 
we attempt to conduct our business and financial affairs so as to protect against political and economic risks applicable to operations in the various countries where we operate  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting against such risks 
our international assets and operations are subject to various political  economic and other uncertainties  including  among other things  the risks of war  expropriation  nationalization  renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts  taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions  changing political conditions  international monetary fluctuations  currency controls and foreign governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
in addition  if a dispute arises with foreign operations  we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons  especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies  to the jurisdiction of the united states 
our private ownership of oil and gas reserves under oil and gas leases in the united states differs distinctly from our ownership of foreign oil and gas properties 
in the foreign countries in which we do business  the state generally retains ownership of the minerals and consequently retains control of and in many cases  participates in the exploration and production of hydrocarbon reserves 
accordingly  operations outside the united states  and estimates of reserves attributable to properties located outside the united states  may be materially affected by host governments through royalty payments  export taxes and regulations  surcharges  value added taxes  production bonuses and other charges 
risk management and hedging policy our risk management policy is based on the view that oil prices revert to a mean price over the long term 
to the extent that future markets over a forward month period are significantly higher than long term norms  we will hedge production volumes up to certain maximums set forth in our oil hedging policy approved by our board in march maximum hedged volumes increase as the price of oil increases 
variations from this policy require board approval 
the risk management policy states that hedging activity that is speculative or otherwise unrelated to our normal business activities is considered inappropriate 
we recognize the risks inherent in price management 
in order to minimize such risk  we have instituted a set of controls addressing approval authority  trading limits and other control procedures 
all hedging activity is the responsibility of our senior vice president of planning and asset management 
in addition  internal audit  which independently reports to the audit committee  reviews our risk management activity 
we reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through swaps  options and other commodity derivative instruments 
in a typical swap transaction  we will have the right to receive from the counterparty to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge contract and a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we are required to pay the counterparty the difference 
we would be required to pay the counterparty the difference between such prices regardless of whether our production was sufficient to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
since there is not an established pricing index for hedges of california heavy crude oil production  and the cash market for heavy oil production in california tends to vary widely from index prices typically used in oil hedges  we have entered into a physical sales contract to tie our california production to a traded nymex index 
as such  in february  we entered into a year contract  effective january   to sell substantially all of our current and future california crude oil production to conocophillips corporation 
the contract provides pricing based on a fixed percentage of the nymex crude oil price for each type of crude oil that we produce in california 
consequently  the actual price received by the company as a percentage of nymex will vary with our production mix 
based on our current production mix  the price we receive for our california oil production is expected to average approximately of wti 
while the contract does not reduce our exposure to price volatility  it does effectively eliminate the basis differential risk between the nymex price and the field price of our california oil production  thereby facilitating the ability to effectively hedge our realized prices 
insurance the ability to secure certain insurance coverages at prices that we consider reasonable may be impacted and other coverages or endorsements may not be made available 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to duplicate our current insurance package when our policies come up for renewal 
competition markets for production we operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and gas exploration  exploitation  development and production 
the availability of funds and information relating to a property  the minimum projected return on investment  the availability of alternate fuel sources and the intermediate transportation of oil and gas are factors which affect our ability to compete in the marketplace 
our competitors include major integrated oil companies and a substantial number of independent energy companies  many of which possess greater financial and other resources than we do 
our heavy crude oil production in california requires special processing treatment available only from a limited number of refineries 
substantial damage to such a refinery or closures or reductions in capacity due to financial or other factors could adversely affect the market for our heavy crude oil production 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk 
we produce and sell crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  therefore our operating results can be significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices caused by changing market forces 
we reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through swaps  put options  collars and other commodity derivative instruments 
in a typical swap transaction  if the floating price is less than the fixed price  we will have the right to receive from the counterparty to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge contract and a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we are required to pay the counterparty the difference 
in a typical put option contract  we purchase the right to receive from the counterparty the difference  if any  between a fixed price specified in the option less a floating market price 
if the floating price is above the fixed price  we are not entitled to a payment 
a collar contract works similarly as a put  however  we are required to pay the difference between the floating price and ceiling strike price of the collar if the floating price exceeds the ceiling price 
quantities covered by crude hedges are based on west texas intermediate wti barrels 
prices received for our production is expected to average of wti  therefore  each wti barrel effectively hedges barrels of our production 
we use hedge accounting for these instruments  and settlements of gains or losses on these contracts are reported as a component of oil and gas revenues and operating cash flows in the period realized 
these agreements expose us to counterparty credit risk to the extent that the counterparty is unable to meet their settlement commitments to us

we may enter into financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage the impact of changes in interest rates 
our exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from our long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
in late december and early  we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million to hedge the fair value of our notes due and our notes due these swaps were designated as fair value hedges and were reflected as an increase or decrease of long term debt with a corresponding increase in long term assets or liabilities 
in late august and early september  we terminated our swap transactions relating to these notes 
as a result of these terminations  we received accrued interest of million and the present value of the swap option of million on our notes and million in accrued interest and the present value of the swap option of million on our notes 
the remaining gain of million on our notes and million on our notes continues to be reflected as an increase of long term debt and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the life of the notes 
through december   we had amortized million and million  respectively 
in late august and early november  we entered into two new interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million each  to hedge a portion of the fair value of our notes due these swaps were designated as fair value hedges and are reflected as an increase of long term debt of million as of december   with a corresponding increase in long term assets 
under the terms of the first agreement  the counterparty pays us a weighted average fixed annual rate of on total notional amounts of million  and we pay the counterparty a variable annual rate equal to the six month libor rate plus a weighted average rate of 
under the terms of the second agreement  the counterparty pays us a weighted average fixed annual rate of on total notional amounts of million  and we pay the counterparty a variable annual rate equal to the six month libor rate plus a weighted average rate of
