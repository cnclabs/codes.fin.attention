actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents management suggests that the company s summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes the critical accounting policies and estimates that most impact the company s consolidated financial statements are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes provisions for probable doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount expected to be collected 
inventories processed food and poultry inventories and inventories of feed  eggs  medication and packaging supplies are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
if market prices for poultry or feed grains move substantially lower  the company would record adjustments to write down the carrying values of processed poultry and feed inventories to fair market value 
live poultry inventories of broilers are stated at the lower of cost or market and breeders at cost less accumulated amortization 
the cost associated with broiler inventories  consisting principally of chicks  feed  medicine and grower payments  are accumulated during the growing period 
the cost associated with breeder inventories  consisting principally of breeder chicks  feed  medicine and grower payments are accumulated during the growing period 
capitalized breeder costs are then amortized over nine months using the straight line method 
mortality of broilers and breeders is charged to cost of sales as incurred 
high mortality from disease or extreme temperatures would result in abnormal charges to cost of sales to write down live poultry inventories 
long lived assets depreciable long lived assets are primarily comprised of buildings and machinery and equipment 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  which are to years for buildings and to years for machinery and equipment 
an increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives would result in changes to depreciation expense 
the company continually reevaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets  for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as part of this reevaluation  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to the estimated fair value of the asset 
accrued self insurance 
table of contents insurance expense for workers compensation benefits and employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure 
management regularly reviews the assumptions used to recognize periodic expenses 
however  actual expenses could differ significantly from these estimates 
income taxes the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial and income tax purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities 
any audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
interpretation no 
requires consolidation of entities when an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
the consolidation requirements of this pronouncement will be effective for the first reporting period ending after december  the company is in the process of evaluating the implications of interpretation no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  primarily corn and soybean meal 
as a result  the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients 
as market conditions dictate  the company from time to time will lock in future feed ingredient prices using forward purchase agreements with suppliers 
the company does not use such instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any leverage derivatives 
the company s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
the company maintains certain of its debt as fixed rate in nature to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt approximates the carrying amount at october  management believes the potential effects of near term changes in interest rates on the company s fixed rate debt is not material 
the company is a party to no other market risk sensitive instruments requiring disclosure
