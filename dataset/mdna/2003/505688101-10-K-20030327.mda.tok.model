these decreases were the result of a softening economy on retailers and industrial distributors and reduced fill in business for cold weather products in the lacrosse r brand retail channel 
in addition  the company discontinued manufacturing children s insulated footwear which resulted in of the retail channel decrease in net sales 
net sales in the industrial channel of distribution declined from as a result of management s decision to discontinue the mass market apparel business and reduce the number of retail channel products offered in the industrial channel of distribution 
the sales increase for danner r brand products was primarily related to the introduction of new styles using the terra forcetm technology platform within the uniform  hunting  work and outdoor cross training product lines 
gross profit gross profit in decreased million  or  to million from million in as a percent of sales  gross profit increased to in compared to in the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is primarily due to our focus on shifting to higher margin sourced products and a one time charge of million during the first half of related to closing the la crosse factory 
both and were favorably impacted by a million and million  respectively  reduction in the lifo inventory reserve as the manufactured pool of inventory was reduced 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million from million in during  we recorded million of charges associated with the move of the corporate headquarters to portland  oregon from la crosse  wisconsin million and the move of the industrial division to portland  oregon from racine  wisconsin million 
this includes one time charges of million of depreciation expense related to a change in the estimated life of the company s former enterprise software package and related system and a non cash property and equipment impairment charge of million 
factoring out one time restructuring charges in and  the company decreased selling and administrative expenses approximately million mainly as a result of reductions in sales commissions and distribution costs associated with the reduced sales volume and operating efficiencies and cost savings by consolidating the administrative and office functions in portland  oregon 
non operating expenses non operating expenses in decreased million  or  to million from million in the decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in interest expense that was the result of lower average borrowings and lower interest rates

the charge is necessary when the accumulated benefit obligation is in excess of the sums of the respective plan assets and accrued pension liabilities  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales in decreased million  or  to million from million in while net sales of danner r brand footwear increased approximately  this increase was more than offset by decreases in net sales of lacrosse r brand products through the retail channel of distribution and weakness in the industrial channel of distribution 
the increase in sales of the danner r brand product was the result of acceptance of new product offerings  strength in the duty footwear business and favorable weather in the primary markets served 
sales through the lacrosse retail channel of distribution and the industrial channel of distribution were both negatively impacted by the unfavorable weather conditions during the fourth quarter of  the weakness in the industrial and retail sectors of the economy  spot product outages which occurred as a result of the shift of the company s rubber boots from a domestically produced product to a sourced product  as well as a reduction in the offerings in the lacrosse r brand product line 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the company has been going through a period of transition since and  as a result  has incurred costs in both and which impacted margins 
the company experienced increased selling margins on current line products over the past two years as a result of the outsourcing effort 
however  these improvements were impacted in both years by the switch from domestic sourcing to outsourcing 
in  the company announced the closing of its la crosse  clintonville and hillsboro  wisconsin manufacturing facilities 
as a result  the company incurred charges for severance expenses  labor inefficiencies  raw material and component part write downs  and the closing of the facilities 
during the second quarter of  the company incurred an impairment charge of million and a sourcing realignment charge of million 
in addition  the company narrowed its product offering in several areas of the lacrosse r brand product offering  which resulted in establishing reserves related to the disposal of the discontinued products 
in  the company incurred charges for labor inefficiencies  severance costs and a million charge for the partial curtailment of the union pension plan as the company reduced employment at its la crosse manufacturing facility 
in addition  costs were incurred related to raw materials and component parts which were no longer required for domestic manufacturing 
during and  gross profit was impacted favorably by a million and million  respectively  reduction in the lifo inventory reserve as the manufactured pool of inventory was reduced 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  in as compared to the reduction in selling and administrative expenses was driven by the company s strategy to outsource its rubber footwear which resulted in substantial reductions in employment  a reduction in marketing programs supporting the lacrosse r brand and a favorable impact from a partial curtailment of the non union pension plan 
these reductions were largely offset by an acceleration of the write off of goodwill and other intangibles due to a change in useful lives  severance expenses related to the closing of three of the company s manufacturing facilities  the relocation of the company s headquarters from la crosse  wisconsin to portland  oregon and costs incurred to implement the conversion of all of the company s systems to the enterprise resource planning system which was already in use at the portland  oregon location 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  in as compared to the decrease in interest expense was the result of lower average borrowings primarily due to lower inventories and receivables coupled with a lower interest rate on the outstanding debt 
the lower interest rate was a result of the lower market rates which was partially offset by an increase in rates under the new credit agreement entered into in june income taxes the company recorded no income tax benefit in the expected income tax benefit was offset by an increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance since the company has had three consecutive loss years 
in  the company recorded income tax benefits to the extent tax loss carrybacks were available 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded working capital requirements and capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and borrowings under a revolving credit agreement or other long term lending arrangements 
we require working capital to support fluctuating accounts receivable and inventory levels caused by our seasonal business cycle 
borrowing requirements are generally the lowest in the first quarter and the highest during the third quarter 
our revolving credit agreement provides for advances based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory with maximum borrowings of million 
the credit agreement is used to support working capital requirements 
borrowings under the credit agreement and cash flows generated from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next months 
excess cash flows from operations are used to pay down the credit agreement 
at december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and unused availability of million 
the interest rate on the revolving credit agreement is either prime rate plus or libor plus 
the weighted average interest rate for the outstanding balance at december  was 
in addition to the revolving credit agreement  the company has a term loan that expires on may  that calls for semi annual payments of million  with the balance of million due on may  the term loan is secured by  among other things  certain properties and equipment 
in the event of a sale of any of the secured properties and equipment  a portion of the net proceeds will be applied to the term loan 
at the company s option  the interest rate on the term loan is either the bank s prime rate or libor plus 
at december   the company had million outstanding under the term loan 
in the first quarter of  we redeemed the cash surrender value of certain of our life insurance policies for cash totaling approximately  such cash was applied directly to our term loan thereby reducing both the total amount due to approximately million and the amount due in to million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million for in  the company incurred a net loss of million offset by non cash expenses including impairment and asset disposal losses aggregating million  depreciation and amortization totaling million  and changes in working capital components  primarily decreases in accounts receivable of million  and inventory of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable is related to reduced sales from and improved collection techniques 
the decrease in inventory is related to the implementation of our sales forecasting system that allowed us to better schedule the delivery of products to match with customer demand  a reduction in the number of styles being offered and the sale of closeouts during in  the company incurred a net loss of million offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in inventory of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million during the majority of the cash used in both years was for capital expenditures 
net cash used by financing activities was million in compared to million for during  the company repaid million of short term borrowings and million of long term obligations compared to repayments of million of short term borrowings and million of long term obligations 
at december   the company s pension plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of their respective plan assets and accrued pension liabilities which resulted in additional minimum liabilities and an equity reduction of million 
as of december   we were not in compliance with the tangible net worth covenant contained in our revolving agreements with our lenders 
our lenders waived the violations and amended our agreements thereby limiting the amount of permitted capital expenditures to million 
we believe that the company will have sufficient earnings and cash flows in to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements  or we will be able to obtain waivers for any unforeseen future violations of those covenants 
a summary of our contractual cash obligations at december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total and thereafter long term debt    operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      the amount due in of  has been reduced to  as a result of paying down in the first quarter of  a portion of the term note using cash proceeds from the redemption of the cash surrender value of certain life insurance policies held by the company at december  we also have a commercial commitment as described below in thousands other commercial commitment total amount committed outstanding at date of expiration line of credit   june critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  known trends in our industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical policies that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenues are recognized when all of the following criteria are met when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue for our product sales is recognized at the time products are shipped to customers 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
our management analyzes accounts receivable  historical write offs as bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount that we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
we have not experienced significant bad debts expense and our reserve for doubtful accounts of million should be adequate for any exposure to loss in our december  accounts receivable 
product warranties 
the company provides a limited warranty for the replacement of defective products 
the company s standard warranties require the company to repair or replace defective products at no cost to the consumer 
the company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect the company s warranty liability include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and cost per claim 
the company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
the company utilizes historical trends and information received from its customers to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels 
we believe our warranty liability of million at december  should be adequate to cover the estimated costs we will incur in the future for warranty claims on products sold before december  pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
on a periodic basis  we analyze the level of inventory on hand  its cost in relation to market value and estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess or obsolete inventory are required 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates 
if actual or expected requirements were significantly greater or lower than the established reserves  a reduction or increase to the obsolescence allowance would be recorded in the period in which such a determination was made 
we have established reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories and believe the reserve of million at december  is adequate 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
as a matter of policy  we review our major assets for impairment at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our major long lived and intangible assets are goodwill and property and equipment 
we depreciate our property and equipment over their estimated useful lives 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets we determined that the goodwill associated with our industrial division was impaired 
accordingly  we recorded a million charge in the first quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s remaining goodwill of million related to danner division and the investments we have made in our other long term investments  primarily property and equipment of million  we have made assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
please refer to the forward looking statements caption below for a discussion of factors that will have an effect on our ability to attain future levels of product sales and cash flows

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require more prominent and frequent disclosures in the financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
the transitional guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for the december  financial statements 
the interim reporting disclosure requirements will be effective for the company in the first quarter of because the company continues to account for employee stock based compensation under apb opinion no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
the company enters into interest rate swap agreements swap agreements to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its floating rate debt 
the swap agreements exchange floating rate for fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
the notional amounts of interest rate agreements are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent an amount of exposure to credit loss 
for interest rate instruments that effectively hedge interest rate exposures  the net cash amounts paid or received on the agreements are accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
in addition  effective january   the company began recording the fair value of the swap agreements each month as an adjustment to interest expense 
as of december   the company had swap agreements in effect totaling million notional amount  of which million matured in january with another million maturing in october the variable rate borrowings not offset by swap agreements at december  totaled million 
swap agreement rates are based on the three month libor rate 
based on average floating rate borrowings outstanding throughout fiscal year  a basis point change in libor would have caused the company s monthly interest expense to change by approximately  the company believes that these amounts are not material to the earnings of the company
