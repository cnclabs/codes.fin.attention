critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in united states requires management to make judgements  assumptions and estimates that effect the amount reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for but not limited to allowance for doubtful accounts receivables  costs to complete contracts  collectibility of inventory obligations of certain customers  recoverability of inventories and warranty costs 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgements  assumptions and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable the company s trade accounts receivable are subject to credit risks associated with the financial condition of its customers and their liquidity 
the company evaluates all customers periodically to assess their financial condition and liquidity and sets appropriate credit limits based on this analysis 
as a result  the collectibility of accounts receivable may change due to changing general economic conditions and factors associated with each customers particular business 
the company has established a reserve for potentially uncollectible trade accounts receivable which is management s best estimate of the amount of trade accounts receivable that it believes may become uncollectible at a future date due to the foregoing factors 
at march   the company has recorded reserves for uncollectible trade accounts receivable of  it is reasonably possible  that future events or changes in circumstances could cause the realizable value of the company s trade accounts receivable to decline materially  resulting in additional material losses 
inventory obligations of certain customers the company s electronic products segment provides contract manufacturing services for a variety of customers 
typically the company requires its customers to contractually commit to pay for any non returnable or non cancelable raw material inventory purchased by the company on behalf of its customers 
the significant economic downturn in the contract electronics manufacturing industry over the last two years has caused originally scheduled or anticipated production runs to be reduced or cancelled by customers resulting in substantial amounts of raw material inventory being held by the company for which current or former customers are contractually obligated 
to date several customers have failed to honor their contractual obligation to pay for non cancelable and non returnable raw material purchased by the company on their behalf 
accordingly  the company has reclassified this inventory  together with allowances for the company s best estimate of uncollectible amounts  in its financial statements 
at march  such inventory  net of allowances for uncollectible amounts of  was  the company intends to pursue legal action against those customers who fail to honor their contractual obligations to the company and has filed to date two such lawsuits  both of which are awaiting trial 
although the company believes that its contracts with customers are enforceable  there are inherent risks in litigation and it is possible the company will not prevail in these actions  the customer will assert counterclaims and prevail on such claims or that if the company does prevail  the customer will nevertheless not have the financial resources to pay any judgement rendered by the court 
in the event the company does not prevail in litigation  substantially all of this inventory obligation could be rendered uncollectible 
such an outcome  should it occur  could have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
inventories the company maintains raw material inventories of electronic components  motor parts and other materials to meet its expected manufacturing needs for proprietary products and for products manufactured to the design specifications of its customers 
some of these components may become obsolete or unusable due to design changes 
accordingly  the company periodically assesses its raw material inventory for potential impairment of value based on then available information  expectations and estimates and establishes impairment reserves for estimated declines in the realizable value of its inventories 
the actual realizable value of the company s inventories may differ materially from these estimates based on future occurrences and any resulting change in the company s estimates 
the company separately classifies raw material inventory when the inventory for which the customer is contractually obligated to pay is not currently being utilized or is not expected to be used at a future date in production operations see inventory obligations of certain customers above 
at march   the company has recorded inventory reserves of  it is reasonably possible  that future events or changes in circumstances could cause the realizable value of the company s inventories to decline materially  resulting in additional material impairment losses 
percentage of completion revenue recognition on long term contracts costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts the company recognizes revenue on the development projects funded by its customers using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  contract services revenue is based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to management s best estimate of the total costs to be incurred to complete the project 
many of these contracts involve the application of the company s technology to customers products and other applications with demanding specifications 
management s best estimates have sometimes been adversely impacted by unexpected technical challenges requiring  additional analysis and redesign  failure of electronic components to operate in accordance with manufacturers published performance specifications  unexpected prototype failures requiring the purchase of additional parts and a variety of other factors that caused unforeseen delays and additional costs 
it is reasonably possible that total costs to be incurred on any of the projects in process at march  could be materially different from management s estimates  and any modification of management s estimate of total project costs to be incurred could result in material changes in the profitability of affected projects or result in material losses on any affected projects
