critical accounting policies our accounting policies are in conformity with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
below is a discussion of accounting policies  which we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters  which are inherently uncertain 
sales  profit recognition and cost capitalization community development land sales are recognized at closing only when sufficient down payments have been obtained  possession and other attributes of ownership have been transferred to the buyer  and acpt has no significant continuing involvement 
home sale revenues are recognized upon settlement with the homebuyers 
the costs of acquiring and developing land are allocated to these assets and charged to cost of sales as the related inventories are sold 
acpt s interest costs related to land assets are allocated to these assets based on their development stage and relative book value 
the portion of interest allocated to land during the development and construction period is capitalized to the extent of qualifying assets 
remaining interest costs are expensed 
the cost of acquiring the land and construction of the condominiums are allocated to these assets and charged to cost of sales as the condominiums are sold 
the interest incurred on the land acquisition and construction loan is capitalized to the extent of qualifying assets 
the cost of sales is determined by the relative sales value method  which relies on estimated costs and sales values 
residential and commercial land sales can be highly cyclical 
once development is undertaken  no assurances can be given that the company will be able to sell the various developed lots or condominiums in a timely manner 
failure to sell such homes and lots in a timely manner could result in significantly increased carrying costs and erosion or elimination of profit with respect to any development 
even though our cost estimates are based on outside engineers cost estimates  historical cost and current actual development and construction costs can exceed estimates for various reasons  including but not limited to unknown site conditions  rising prices and changes in government regulations 
any estimates of such costs may differ substantially from the actual results of such costs and reduce or eliminate the future profits with respect to any development 
impairment of long lived assets quarterly  acpt evaluates the carrying value of its long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in cases where management is holding for sale particular properties  acpt assesses impairment based on whether the net realizable value estimated sales price less costs of disposal of each individual property to be sold is less than the net book value 
otherwise  acpt assesses impairment of its real estate properties based on whether it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows from each individual property will be less than its net book value 
if a property is impaired  its basis is adjusted to its fair market value 
depreciation of investments in real estate buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years using the straight line or double declining balance methods  furniture  fixtures and equipment over five to seven years using the straight line method  deferred expenses are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight line method  all of which are judgmental determinations

the residential lots are sold to homebuilders in bulk pursuant the terms of option contracts that are secured by letters of credit 
the sale is closed on a lot by lot basis when the builder purchases the lot 
residential lots can vary in size and location resulting in pricing differences 
gross profit margins of residential lots are fairly consistent within any given village in st 
charles 
land sales revenue in any one period is affected by the mix of lot sizes and  to a greater extent  the mix between residential and commercial sales 
commercial land is typically sold by contract that allows for a study period and delayed settlement until the purchaser obtains the necessary permits for development 
the sales prices and gross profit margins for commercial parcels vary significantly depending on the location  size  extent of development and ultimate use 
commercial land sales are cyclical and usually have a noticeable positive effect on our earnings in the period they reach settlement 
in  we sold standard size single family lots for an average sales price of  small single family family lots for an average sales price of  townhome lots for an average price of  acres of commercial land for sales prices that ranged from to per square foot  compared to standard size single family lots for an average sales price of  small single family lots for an average sales price of  townhome lots for an average price of  acres of commercial land for sales prices that ranged from 
to per square foot sold in in  we sold standard size single family lots for an average sales price of  townhome lots for an average price of  acres of commercial land for sales prices that ranged from to per square foot 
during the last three years demand for lots in charles county has increased while the supply has decreased 
we have incurred many hurdles in obtaining permits on a timely basis to deliver a steady supply of lots 
pursuant to our agreement with charles county  we will be able to obtain permits for residential lots per year through this gives st 
charles the competitive edge for and should allow us a steady stream of inventory once our projects are streamlined in the approval process 
as of december  we had fully developed single family lots ready to deliver to builders and a backlog of lots with an aggregate sales price of  in addition we have acres of commercial land under contract for a total sales price of  the combined gross profit margin ranged from in  in and in these variations are a result of the change in mix of sales between years and the quality of the commercial sales 
during  of the total sales revenue was generated by residential sales compared to in and in typically commercial sales outside of fairway village produce a greater gross profit margin than the residential lots 
the margins for the residential lots in fairway have increased from in to in and in these increases are primarily a result of the sales prices in fairway village escalating at a rate greater than the expected development costs 
during  the townhome lots in smallwood village were sold out 
these lots produced a gross profit margin during the last three years that ranged from to 
these margins were lower than our typical residential margins due to location and changes in the county s regulations 
the gross profit margin of the si gnificant commercial sale was  less than expected due to the unexpected costs of moving major utility lines from the purchaser s development path 
rental property revenues and operating results us operations certain of the apartment properties in which we hold an ownership interest qualify for the consolidation method of accounting 
as a result  the apartment property s entire revenue and expenses are reflected in our financial statements with the portion of net income attributable to outside owners reflected as minority interest 
seven properties were consolidated during  and as of december  one more property met the consolidation criteria 
three of the properties are market rent properties  allowing us to determine the appropriate rental rates 
even though we can determine the rents  a portion of our units must be leased to tenants with low to moderate income 
three of the properties are subsidized by hud and one property is a mix of subsidized units and market rent units 
hud dictates the rents of the subsidized units 
the profit contribution rental property revenue net of operating expenses  interest expense  depreciation and amortization and minority interest from the consolidated apartment properties increased to  in compared to  in and  in in  market conditions allowed us to increase our market rate rents while the subsidized rents increased by 
operating expenses increased in and in the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to historic high increases in commercial insurance for rental properties and increased maintenance costs as we push to improve the value of the properties 
in  the increase in the subsidies did not cover the increased cost of insurance and operating cost 
in addition  during one property incurred a fire loss in excess of its insurance coverage of equity in earnings from partnerships and development fees us operations the results of our share of earnings from the partnerships that do not qualify for the consolidated method of accounting are reflected in this section 
the affect on earnings varies from partnership to partnership  depending on our investment book basis in the property  where the partnership is in the earnings stream  whether or not the limited partners have recovered their capital contribution  the partnership s ability to distribute cash and the amortization of any sponsor and developer fees 
in  we recognized a decrease in income from the apartment properties compared to primarily due to a fire loss in one subsidized property that exceeded the insurance coverage and one month s lost subsidy in another property during the conversion to market rents 
our share of this fire loss was  we have switched insurance carriers and coverage limits to prevent this from recurring 
occupancy rates remained stable in compared to which were higher than in  we recognized a increase in our share of the apartment properties income compared to in  one subsidized property received a retroactive increase in its subsidies and our share of cash flow from one property increased to from after the limited partners recovered their initial investment in the third quarter of on december   we purchased the limited partners interest in this property  refinanced the property and commenced a conversion from a hud interest subsidy to a ma rket rate property 
during   of architect fees was written off when an updated product design was selected for our next apartment complex 
in  we evaluated a potential acquisition to our apartment investment portfolio 
the complex did not meet our acquisition requirements  resulting in the write off of the  incurred during this process 
management and other fees us operations we earn a monthly fee from the apartment properties we manage  including four properties owned by or an affiliate of the wilson family 
in addition  we receive a fee from these properties and the properties in puerto rico for the use of the property management computer system purchased at the end of the cost of this system is reflected in depreciation expense 
only the fees from the properties that are not consolidated are reflected in this section 
the management fees increased in as a result of an increase in the monthly management of a wilson family owned property from to and increased rental revenues earned by the apartment properties 
the management fees decreased in compared to due to the recognition in of a  incentive management fee from one subsidized property 
this fee is restricted to surplus cash and does not occur on a regular basis 
selling  general and administrative expense us operations the costs associated with the oversight of our us operations  accounting  human resources  office management and technology  as well as the executive office are included in this section 
armc employs the centralized office management approach for its property management services 
the apartment properties reimburse armc for certain costs incurred at the central office that are attributable to the operations of those properties 
the amounts reflected in this section are net of those reimbursements 
selling  general and administrative costs incurred in the us have remained relatively stable during   and despite rising prices 
during  certain related party transactions and staffing shortages in puerto rico required additional support from the us office 
the allocation of these costs to the puerto rico operations produced a cost reduction attributable to the us operations 
this reduction is not expected to continue in in october of  the consulting fee to james j 
wilson reduced to  per year from  per year 
the cost savings from this reduction was offset by the addition of d o insurance and the recognition of  of compensation expense related to employee and trustee incentive rights 
we recognize compensation expense on incentive rights based on the changes in our share trading price 
in  reductions in our share price resulted in a decrease in expenses compared to we expect the cost of d o insurance to increase in as well as audit fees to meet the new internal control reporting requirements 
interest expense us operations the interest related to the us recourse debt  exclusive of debt related to the apartment properties  is allocated to the qualifying land inventory based on its book balance 
any excess interest  interest on capital leases and amortization of certain loan fees are reflected as interest expense 
in  interest expense decreased compared to and the interest expensed in increased compared to overall interest expense has declined for the last two years  a result of the overall reduction in prime lending rate and debt refinanced at a reduced borrowing rate 
the increase in was primarily due to the recognition of  of unamortized loan fees and warrants when we refinanced a  term loan 
provision for income taxes us operations the effective tax rates for  and are  and respectively 
the federal and state statutory rate is 
the difference between the statutory rate and the effective rate for is related to an increase in the calculated tax benefit of certain investments in subsidiaries 
the difference between the statutory rate and the effective rate for is related to adjustments to the deferred income tax for transfers of ownership in the housing partnerships and a step up in the tax basis of the assets

the residential land is sold to homebuilders by the parcel 
the sales contract typically calls for a down payment and a non interest bearing note for the balance 
land sales revenue in any one period is affected by the mix of residential and commercial sales 
the gross profit margins of residential and commercial land are consistent within any given development 
residential and commercial land sales are cyclical and usually have a noticeable positive effect on our earnings in the period they reach settlement 
there were no land sales in in  land sales decreased from those in during  we sold a parcel of land for condominium units compared to two parcels for a total of condominium units sold in the sale prices increased from  in early to  in sales revenues reflect the lot sales prices net of discounts for the imputed interest on partially non interest bearing notes taken as partial payment for the purchase of the lots 
all notes have been collected 
the next parcel available in was retained to establish our homebuilding inventory 
we are evaluating the economics of retaining the remaining parcel in this phase for our own homebuilding operations

equity in earnings from partnerships increased to  during the twelve months ended december   compared to  in during  we refinanced the existing mortgages on two unconsolidated apartment properties  providing us with  of note repayments   of finance fees and  of cash distributions 
the increase in equity in earnings from partnerships is primarily a result of cash distributions received in excess of the investment basis of  and increased rents  reduced vacancies  reduced operating and financial expenses  offset in part by increased insurance premiums 
these increases in earnings from partnerships were partially offset by the reduction in earnings from eli

management and other fees puerto rico operations we earn a monthly fee from the apartment and commercial properties we manage  including properties owned by the wilson family 
in addition to the monthly fee  we earn incentive management fees from three of the properties 
fees earned from three property owner associations operating in parque escorial are also reflected in this section 
management fees increased in compared to primarily due to the recognition in of  of special fees related to the refinancing of two apartment properties 
basic management fees were lower in than in and as the two properties converted to condominiums were sold 
prior to conversion  the annual management fees from these two properties were  during  we recognized  of special fees for the refinancing and conversion of these two properties

anticipated cash flow from operations  existing loans  refinanced or extended loans  and new financings are expected to meet our financial commitments for the year

capital spending and development in  net cash used in investing activities reached  a increase from in   was used for investing activities  a decrease from these decreases are primarily attributable to reduced investment in our community development assets 
the development of planned communities requires significant up front capital for planning  engineering  major infrastructure and interest carry 
this infrastructure tends to be sporadic 
once the major development is in place so that the individual lots or parcels can be developed  additional capital resources are needed to get the lots ready for sale 
the parcel or lot development and the ultimate sale of the land are usually within a twelve month period 
apartment acquisitions and construction of office buildings require additional significant capital resources 
the commitment for capital  timing of completion of development projects and asset acquisitions are contingent upon  among other things  receipt of approvals from regulatory agencies  market conditions and the availability of funds 
cash needed to finance projects currently under development as well as additional planned projects is expected to be made available from operating cash flows  existing development loans  joint venture partn ers  county funded bonds and  if necessary  new bank financings

we anticipate that this loan will be extended prior to its maturity 
the collateral has sufficient value to support the loan 
should the lender decide not to extend the loan  two other financial institutions have requested opportunities to provide us with financing  although there are no assurances that this will be completed 
this credit facility has  of available development funds that have not been advanced 
the maturity date of the  due kembt corporation kembt is tied to the maturity date of the firstbank credit facility and any subsequent extensions 
these loans are subject to cross collateral and cross default provisions 
the construction loan for the brisas homebuilding project matures on august  due to delays in obtaining the appropriate permits  the project did not start as scheduled 
the project is not expected to be completed and the loan repaid until the middle of the sales have been consistent and we expect the bank to extend the credit facility for twelve months 
construction advances of  remain available under this credit facility 
substantially all of the company s community development and all of its homebuilding assets are encumbered by recourse debt 
during  we settled long standing disputes with the charles county government 
as part of that settlement  the county agreed to issue tax exempt bonds to fund certain major infrastructure in st 
charles and we agreed to provide letters of credit to secure the bonds and escalate our development pace 
the bonds will be repaid from future lot sales in st 
charles 
during  we will seek additional development loans  construction loans and permanent mortgages for continued development of st 
charles  a new apartment project in st

we feel that our financing efforts will be successful but there can be no assurances that they will be completed 
debt guarantees and other obligations acpt and its subsidiaries typically provide guarantees for another subsidiary s loan or letters of credit 
in many cases more than one company guarantees the same debt 
all of these companies are consolidated and the debt or other financial commitment is included in acpt s consolidated financial statements 
these guarantees should not impair our ability to conduct our business through our subsidiaries or to pursue our development plans 
in addition  igp guaranteed of the outstanding balance owed on two apartment mortgages 
as of december   the aggregate loan amount subject to igp s guarantee is  impact of inflation and changing prices in general  we are able to increase our market rents  land prices and home prices to counteract the inflationary effects of increasing costs 
in recent history  the increases in the hud subsidies have not offset the increase in the costs to operate and maintain the properties 
inflation tends to increase the value of our real estate assets 
the cash flow from the apartment properties has been negatively impacted by the increased costs of insurance 
intercompany dividend restrictions certain of our debt and regulatory agreements require us to abide by covenants which  among other things  limit the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions 
the regulatory agreements governing the apartment properties limit the dividend to annual or semi annual distributions of no more than surplus cash 
in addition  the distributions of properties are limited to a specified annual cumulative rate of return ranging from to 
lender approval is required prior to lda or brisas making any cash distributions in excess of distributions to pay income taxes on lda s and brisas s generated taxable income unless certain conditions exist that provide for adequate working capital for debt service and operations for the following twelve months 
these restrictions are not expected to impair our ability to conduct our business through our subsidiaries or to pursue our development plans 
insurance although we believe our properties are adequately covered by insurance  we cannot predict at this time if we will be able to obtain full coverage at a reasonable cost in the future 
the costs associated with our october  property and casualty insurance renewals were higher than anticipated 
all lines of coverage were affected by higher premiums  in part because insurance companies have experienced a loss of income on their investments  underwriting results have been poor and also as a result of the events of september  our insurance renewal on october  increased premiums from the prior year approximately 
the property insurance deductible increased from  to  per claim 
in april  our renewal of the directors and officers liability policy resulted in increased premiums of from the prior year 
the deductible for the directors and officers liability policy is  for securities claims and  for all other claims 
in october we obt ained professional errors and omissions liability with a deductible of  per claim 
in  all risk property insurers began attaching terrorism exclusions to insurance policies 
as a result of the terrorism risk insurance act of our insurance carriers removed the terrorism exclusions 
in the future  terrorism insurance will be priced separately within the property insurance coverage 
unlike earthquake exposure  insurers do not yet have a means of modeling the terrorism risk 
however  this coverage may have a significant cost associated with an adequate amount of coverage to meet our debt covenants
