item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
introduction the results of operations for allmerica financial corporation and subsidiaries afc or the company include the accounts of allmerica financial life insurance and annuity company afliac and first allmerica financial life insurance company faflic  afc s principal life insurance and annuity companies  the hanover insurance company hanover and citizens insurance company of america citizens  afc s principal property and casualty companies  and certain other insurance and non insurance subsidiaries 
afliac and faflic are both domiciled in the commonwealth of massachusetts  while hanover and citizens are domiciled in the states of new hampshire and michigan  respectively 
prior to december   afliac was domiciled in the state of delaware 
description of operating segments the company offers financial products and services in two major areas risk management and asset accumulation 
within these broad areas  the company conducts business principally in three operating segments 
these segments are risk management  allmerica financial services afs  and allmerica asset management aam 
the separate financial information of each segment is presented consistent with the way results are regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision makers in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
a summary of the company s reportable segments is included below 
the risk management segment manages property and casualty operations through two lines of business based upon product and identified as personal lines and commercial lines 
personal lines include property and casualty coverages such as personal automobile  homeowners and other personal policies  while commercial lines include property and casualty coverages such as workers compensation  commercial automobile  commercial multiple peril and other commercial policies 
prior to  the risk management segment managed its business through three distribution channels identified as standard markets  sponsored markets and specialty markets 
the asset accumulation group includes two segments allmerica financial services and allmerica asset management 
prior to september   the afs segment manufactured and sold variable annuities  variable universal life and traditional life insurance products  as well as certain group retirement products 
on september   the company announced plans to consider strategic alternatives  including a significant reduction of sales of proprietary variable annuities and life insurance products 
this resulted from the cumulative effect of the significant  persistent decline in the equity market  culminating in the third quarter of  that followed the decline in the second quarter  as well as the ratings downgrades see rating agency actions 
subsequently  the company ceased all new sales of proprietary variable annuities and life insurance products 
in the future  the afs business will consist of two components 
first  the company plans to transform its former agency distribution channel see allmerica financial services statutory premiums and deposits for a description of its former distribution channels into an independent broker dealer  veravest investments  inc  formerly allmerica investments  inc 
veravest  to distribute non proprietary investment and insurance products 
the company has entered into agreements with leading investment product and insurance providers and is seeking additional alliances whereby these providers would compensate the company for non proprietary product sales by veravest s registered representatives 
second  the company plans to retain and service existing customer accounts 
these include variable annuity and variable universal life accounts  as well as certain remaining traditional life and group retirement accounts  which were issued by its life insurance subsidiaries  afliac and faflic 
however  the company expects that the persistency of its existing customer policies and contracts will be substantially less than its historical experience 
through its allmerica asset management segment  prior to september  faflic offered guaranteed investment contracts gics 
gics  also referred to as funding agreements  are investment contracts  which can contain either short term or long term maturities and are issued to institutional buyers or to various business or charitable trusts 
declining financial strength ratings from various rating agencies during resulted in gic contractholders terminating all remaining short term funding agreements and made it impractical to continue selling new long term funding agreements 
furthermore  the company retired certain long term funding agreements  at discounts  during the fourth quarter of this segment continues to provide investment advisory services  primarily to affiliates and to third parties  such as money market and other fixed income clients through its subsidiary  opus investment management  inc formerly allmerica asset management  inc 
additionally  during  the company transferred management of amgro  inc amgro  the company s property and casualty insurance premium financing business  to this segment 
amgro was previously part of the risk management segment 
in addition to the three operating segments  the company has a corporate segment  which consists primarily of cash  investments  corporate debt  capital securities mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the company and corporate overhead expenses 
corporate overhead expenses reflect costs not attributable to a particular segment  such as those related to certain officers and directors  technology  finance  human resources and legal 
results of operations consolidated overview consolidated net loss income includes the results of each segment of the company  which management evaluates on a pre tax and pre minority interest basis 
in addition  net loss income is adjusted for certain items which management believes are not indicative of the company s core operations 
adjusted net loss income excludes items such as net realized investment gains and losses  including certain gains or losses on derivative instruments  because fluctuations in these gains and losses are determined by interest rates  financial markets and the timing of sales 
also  adjusted net loss income excludes net gains and losses on disposals of businesses  discontinued operations  restructuring and reorganization costs  extraordinary items  the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items  which in each case  are neither normal nor recurring 
although the items excluded from adjusted net loss income may be significant components in understanding and assessing the company s financial performance  management believes adjusted net loss income enhances an investor s understanding of the company s results of operations by highlighting net loss income attributable to the normal  recurring operations of the business  consistent with industry practice 
however  adjusted net loss income should not be construed as a substitute for net loss income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the company s consolidated net loss increased million  to million in  compared to million in the increase in net loss resulted primarily from a decrease in adjusted net income of million  principally the result of a significant segment loss in afs 
also contributing to this decline was a million loss from the sale of the universal life business and a million increase in restructuring and reorganization costs  net of taxes 
partially offsetting these items were a million gain from the retirement of trust instruments supported by funding obligations and a million increase in gains on derivative instruments  net of taxes 
in  the company s consolidated net income decreased million  or  to a net loss of million  compared to net income of million in the reduction in net income in primarily resulted from a decrease in adjusted net income of million and a loss from selected property and casualty exited agencies  policies  groups  and programs of million  net of taxes 
in addition  the reduction in net income in also resulted from derivative and voluntary pool losses of million and million  respectively  net of taxes 
these decreases in were partially offset by lower after tax restructuring costs 
the following table reflects adjusted net loss income and a reconciliation to consolidated net loss income 
adjusted net loss income consists of segment loss income  federal income tax benefit expense on segment loss income and minority interest on capital securities 
for the years ended december in millions segment loss income before federal income taxes and minority interest risk management asset accumulation allmerica financial services allmerica asset management corporate segment loss income before federal income tax benefit expense and minority interest federal income tax benefit expense on segment loss income minority interest on capital securities adjusted net loss income adjustments net of taxes and amortization  as applicable net realized investment losses gains losses on derivative instruments gain from retirement of trust instruments supported by funding obligations additional consideration received from sale of defined contribution business sales practice litigation loss from sale of universal life business restructuring costs other reorganization costs loss from selected property and casualty exited agencies  policies  groups and programs voluntary pool losses loss income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net of taxes net loss income compared to the company s segment loss income before federal income taxes and minority interest was a million loss in  compared to income of million in this decline is attributable to a decrease of million from the afs segment  partially offset by an increase from the risk management segment of million 
the decrease in the afs segment reflects net charges of million resulting from additional declines in equity market values during  ratings downgrades see rating agency actions  and the company s decision to cease sales of proprietary life insurance and annuity products see description of operating segments 
these charges include million of additional amortization of the deferred policy acquisition cost dac asset and million due to a change in the assumptions related to the long term cost of guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb for variable annuity products  net of the related dac amortization 
in addition  the company recognized impairments of capitalized technology costs associated with variable products totaling million 
the increase in risk management segment income is primarily attributable to an estimated benefit of approximately million related to net premium rate increases  a million decrease in the adverse development of prior years reserves and a million decrease in catastrophe losses 
additionally  segment income increased due to approximately million of decreased current accident year non catastrophe claims 
partially offsetting these items were increased policy acquisition expenses of million and lower net investment income of million 
the federal income tax benefit was million for  compared to an expense of million in this tax benefit is primarily the result of the significant loss recognized by the afs segment in net realized investment losses  after taxes and amortization  were million during  primarily due to million of fixed maturity impairments  net of taxes  and million of after tax losses related to the termination of certain derivative instruments 
these losses were partially offset by million of after tax net realized gains from the sale of approximately billion of fixed income securities 
during  net realized losses on investments  after taxes and amortization  were million  primarily due to after tax realized losses from impairments of fixed maturities of million 
these losses were partially offset by million of after tax net realized gains from the sale of approximately billion of fixed income securities 
gains losses on derivative instruments  net of taxes  increased million to a net gain of million in as a result of the termination of certain derivative instruments which previously were recognized as ineffective hedges 
during  the company recognized losses on derivatives  net of taxes  of million 
these losses primarily represent an accounting charge for hedge ineffectiveness on certain derivatives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement no 
see derivative instruments 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a gain on the retirement of trust instruments supported by funding obligations of million  net of taxes 
this gain resulted from the retirement of certain long term funding obligations at discounts see significant transactions gain on retirement of funding obligations 
during the third quarter of  the company received additional consideration of million  net of taxes  from the sale of the defined contribution business in the company sold  through a coinsurance agreement  the fixed universal life insurance block of business effective december   which resulted in the recognition of a million after tax loss see significant transactions sale of universal life business 
the company recognized a benefit of million and million  net of taxes  in and  respectively  as a result of refining cost estimates related to the sales practice class action lawsuit that was settled in in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an after tax charge of million related to the restructuring of its afs segment 
this restructuring cost consisted of severance and other employee benefit related expenses  as well as the cancellation of certain lease agreements and contracted services 
in addition  the company recognized other reorganization costs of million  net of taxes  primarily related to the forgiveness of interest on certain loans to afs agents 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an after tax charge of million for severance and other employee related costs resulting from the reorganization of its technology support group 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an after tax loss of million related to the exit of selected property and casualty agencies  policies  groups  and programs 
this loss primarily reflects an increase in loss reserves for both the current and prior accident years 
this resulted from a process whereby the company evaluated its approximately  agencies in the risk management segment and identified agencies that did not meet certain profitability standards or were not strategically aligned with the company 
for these agents  the company either terminated the relationship or restricted the agent s ability to offer commercial lines policies 
certain groups and specialty programs were also discontinued see risk management selected property casualty exited agencies  policies  groups programs 
voluntary pool losses reflect the company s participation in a reserve deficiency of a voluntary excess and casualty rein surance pool 
from to  the company voluntarily participated in this reinsurance pool along with several other property and casualty carriers 
the pool was dissolved in and since that time has been in run off 
during the fourth quarter of  the pool obtained results from an independent actuarial review of its current reserve position  which noted a range of reserve deficiency  primarily as a result of adverse development of asbestos claims 
as a result of this study  the company recognized losses  net of taxes  of million  based on the company s participation in the reserve deficiency 
during  the company recognized a million loss  net of taxes  upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
during  the company recognized a million loss  net of taxes  upon adoption of statement no 
compared to the company s segment income before federal taxes and minority interest decreased million  or  to million during this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in income from the risk management and afs segments of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in risk management s segment income was primarily attributable to decreased favorable loss and loss adjustment expenses lae reserve development related to prior years of million and to an increase of approximately million in current accident year losses and lae  primarily in the personal automobile  commercial multiple peril and homeowners lines 
these decreases were partially offset by net premium rate increases of approximately million 
afs segment income decreased million principally due to lower asset based fees  primarily resulting from a decrease in the market value of assets under management in the variable product lines  and to lower investment management fees and brokerage income 
the decrease in afs segment income is also attributable to higher policy benefits and other operating expenses  partially offset by lower deferred policy acquisition costs 
the effective tax rate for segment income was for  as compared to in the decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to lower underwriting income resulting in an increase in the proportion of tax exempt investment income and low income housing credits to pre tax income 
net realized losses on investments  after taxes and amortization  were million during  primarily due to after tax realized losses from impairments of fixed maturities of million 
these losses were partially offset by million of after tax net realized gains from the sale of approximately billion of fixed income securities 
during  net realized losses on investments  after taxes and amortization  were million  primarily attributable to after tax realized losses of million resulting from the sale of approximately billion of fixed income securities 
in addition  the company recognized million in after tax realized losses  due to impairments of fixed maturities 
the company recognized losses on derivatives  net of taxes  of million during the fourth quarter of these losses primarily represent the aforementioned accounting charge for hedge ineffectiveness on certain derivatives in accordance with statement no 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an after tax loss of million related to the aforementioned exit of selected property and casualty agencies  policies  groups and programs 
the company recognized a charge  net of taxes  in the fourth quarter of  of million related to the aforementioned voluntary pool losses 
the company recognized a benefit of million  net of taxes  in  as a result of refining cost estimates related to the aforementioned class action lawsuit that was settled in in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an after tax charge of million related to severance and other employee related costs resulting from the reorganization of its technology support group 
during  the company recognized an after tax restructuring charge of million 
this charge is the result of a formal company wide restructuring plan  intended to reduce expenses and enhance revenues 
this plan consisted of various initiatives  including a series of internal reorganizations  consolidations in home office operations  consolidations in field offices  changes in distribution channels and product changes 
during  the company recognized a million loss  net of taxes  upon adoption of statement no 
this loss resulted from recognizing derivative instruments held by the company on january   at their fair values 
this adjustment represents net losses that were previously deferred in other comprehensive income on derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting 
the company recorded an offsetting gain in other comprehensive income of million  net of taxes  to recognize these derivative instruments 
segment results the following is management s discussion and analysis of the company s results of operations by business segment 
the segment results are presented before taxes and minority interest and other items which management believes are not indicative of overall operating trends  including realized gains and losses 
risk management the following table summarizes the results of operations for the risk management segment for the years ended december in millions segment revenues net premiums written    net premiums earned    net investment income other income total segment revenues    losses and lae    policy acquisition expenses other operating expenses segment income compared to risk management s segment income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the increase in segment income is primarily attributable to an estimate of approximately million of net premium rate increases 
net premium rate increases reflect rate actions  discretionary pricing adjustments  inflation and changes in exposure  net of the estimated impact of loss inflation and policy acquisition costs 
in addition  development on prior years reserves improved million  to million of adverse development  for the year ended december  from million of adverse development for the year ended december  the favorable change in reserve development in is primarily the result of improving commercial lines claim frequency  partially offset by adverse development in the personal automobile line 
net catastrophe losses decreased million  to million for the year ended december  in addition  losses and lae decreased during due to approximately million of decreased current accident year claims frequency primarily in the workers compensation  commercial automobile  commercial multi peril and homeowners lines 
partially offsetting these items is a decrease in net investment income of million and a decrease of policies in force since december   resulting in decreased segment income of approximately million 
policy acquisition expenses increased as a result of the variable expenses related to the aforementioned premium rate increases  primarily commissions and premium taxes 
in addition  policy acquisition expenses increased million as a result of higher premium tax and commission rates during other income decreased million for the year ended december   primarily due to the decline in finance charge income as a result of the transfer of amgro from the risk management segment to the aam segment 
compared to risk management s segment income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the decline in segment income is primarily attributable to increased losses and lae resulting from a million decrease in favorable development on prior years reserves 
the unfavorable change in reserve development is primarily the result of an increase in personal automobile loss frequency and severity  and the company having captured  in and  the accumulated benefits of its claims redesign efforts 
other operating expenses increased during primarily due to increased technology costs and premium charge offs 
partially offsetting these items are an estimate of approximately million of net rate increases  primarily in commercial lines 
in addition  net catastrophe losses decreased million  to million for the year ended december  net catastrophe losses include million of incurred losses related to the events of september  a net loss of million and a net benefit of million are included in segment income in and  respectively  as a result of a whole account aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement aggregate excess of loss reinsurance treaty  which provides coverage for the accident year 
product line results underwriting results are reported using statutory accounting principles  which are prescribed by state insurance regulators 
the primary difference between statutory accounting principles and gaap is the deferral of certain underwriting costs under gaap that are amortized over the life of the policy 
under statutory accounting principles  these costs are recognized when incurred or paid 
management reviews the operations of this business based upon statutory results 
in  the company reorganized its risk management segment 
under the new structure  the risk management segment manages its operations through two lines of business based upon product offerings and identified as personal lines and commercial lines 
personal lines include personal automobile  homeowners and other personal policies  while commercial lines include workers compensation  commercial automobile  commercial multiple peril and other commercial policies 
the following table summarizes the results of operations for the risk management segment for the years ended december in millions  except ratios statutory net statutory statutory net statutory statutory net statutory premiums loss premiums loss premiums loss written ratio written ratio written ratio personal lines personal automobile   homeowners other personal total personal    commercial lines workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial total commercial total    statutory combined ratio personal lines commercial lines total statutory underwriting loss gain personal lines commercial lines total reconciliation to segment income net investment income other income and expenses  net corporate overhead expenses net deferred acquisition expenses provision for uncollectible accounts policyholders dividends other statutory to gaap adjustments segment income statutory loss ratio is a common industry measurement of the results of property and casualty insurance underwriting 
this ratio reflects incurred claims compared to premiums earned 
the ratios exclude the effect of agency actions discussed in selected property casualty exited agencies  policies  groups programs and the voluntary pool losses discussed in asbestos and environmental reserves 
statutory combined ratio is a common industry measurement of the results of property and casualty insurance underwriting 
this ratio is the sum of the ratio of incurred claims and claim expenses to premiums earned and the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred to premiums written 
federal income taxes  net investment income and other non underwriting expenses are not reflected in the statutory combined ratio 
statutory underwriting results include certain overhead expenses  which on a gaap basis are reflected in the corporate segment 
compared to personal lines personal lines net premiums written increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  this is primarily the result of increases of million  or  and million  or  in the personal automobile and homeowners lines  respectively 
the increase in the personal automobile line is primarily the result of  and net premium rate increases in michigan  new york and new jersey  respectively  since december  the increase in the homeowners line resulted primarily from net premium rate increases of and in michigan and new york  respectively 
policies in force for all personal lines decreased since december  personal lines underwriting results declined million to an underwriting loss of million for the year ended december  the decline in underwriting results is primarily attributable to increased underwriting expenses  principally related to the increased expenses for mandatory assigned risk personal automobile business in new york 
in addition  underwriting expenses increased due to higher premium tax expenses and increases in agents contingent commissions 
underwriting results were also unfavorably affected by increased current year claims frequency in the personal automobile line for the year ended december  and by an million increase in adverse development during in the personal automobile line 
partially offsetting these items is an estimate of approximately million of net rate increases 
in addition  catastrophe losses decreased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in commercial lines commercial lines net premiums written decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of the company s termination of agencies and the withdrawal of commercial lines underwriting capacity from an additional agencies during the fourth quarter of as a group  these agencies historically produced unsatisfactory loss ratios 
in addition  the company has seen a reduction in premium levels from active agents as re underwriting efforts to target specific classes of business and strengthen underwriting guidelines continue see selected property casualty exited agencies  policies  groups programs 
as a result of these actions  policies in force decreased  and in the commercial automobile  workers compensation  and commercial multiple peril lines  respectively  since december  management believes the impact of the agency actions will have a diminishing effect on policies in force  since the agency actions are substantially complete 
partially offsetting these decreases in policies in force were rate increases in all of the commercial lines since december  commercial lines underwriting results improved million to an underwriting gain of million for the year ended december  the improvement in underwriting results is primarily attributable to approximately million of net premium rate increases during the year ended december  development on prior years reserves improved million to million of favorable development for the year ended december  from million of adverse development for the same period in in addition  catastrophe losses decreased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in in  underwriting results also included a net benefit  when compared to  as the result of exiting historically unprofitable business under the aforementioned agency management actions 
compared to personal lines personal lines net premiums written increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  this is primarily the result of increases of million  or  and million  or  in the personal automobile and homeowners lines  respectively 
the increase in the personal automobile line is primarily the result of and net premium rate increases in new york and michigan  respectively  and an overall increase of in policies in force since december  partially offsetting these favorable items in the personal automobile line is a massachusetts net rate reduction in the increase in the homeowners line resulted primarily from rate increases of in michigan and an overall increase in policies in force in net premiums written reflected ceded premiums of million and million under the aforementioned aggregate excess of loss reinsurance treaty for and  respectively 
personal lines underwriting results decreased million to an underwriting loss of million for the year ended december  the decline in underwriting results is primarily the result of a decrease in favorable development on prior years reserves of million  to million of adverse development for the year ended december   from million of favorable development for the same period in the unfavorable trend in reserve development is primarily the result of an increase in personal automobile loss frequency and severity 
partially offsetting the unfavorable effect of prior years reserve development was a decrease in catastrophe losses of million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in net benefits of million and million are included in underwriting results relating to the aforementioned aggregate excess of loss reinsurance treaty in and  respectively 
commercial lines commercial lines net premiums written increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this is primarily the result of increases of million  or and million  or  in the commercial multiple peril and the commercial automobile lines  respectively 
the increase in the commercial multiple peril line is primarily the result of rate increases of and in michigan and new york  respectively 
in addition  the commercial automobile line experienced rate increases of  and in michigan  massachusetts  and new york  respectively  since december  net premiums written reflected ceded premiums of million and million under the aforementioned aggregate excess of loss reinsurance treaty in and commercial lines underwriting results deteriorated million to an underwriting loss of million for the year ended december  the decrease in underwriting results is primarily attributable to a deterioration of development on prior years reserves of million  to million of adverse development for the year ended december   from million of favorable development for the same period in the decline in underwriting results is also attributable to an increase in policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses since december  primarily related to an absence of ceding commission income from specialty market business that has not been renewed 
partially offsetting these items was a decrease in catastrophe losses of million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in also  net premium rates increased by approximately million during the year ended december  net benefits of million and million are included in underwriting results relating to the aforementioned aggregate excess of loss reinsurance treaty in and  respectively 
investment results net investment income before tax was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in net investment income in  compared to  primarily reflects a reduction in average pre tax yields on fixed securities 
the decrease in net investment income also reflects a reduction in average invested assets as a result of a million dividend from the property and casualty companies to the holding company and the transfer of million to fund the property and casualty companies portion of the additional minimum pension liability recorded by afc at december  pursuant to the cost allocation policy under the company s consolidated service agreement 
in addition  net investment income decreased due to the impact of defaults on certain high yield fixed maturities 
average pre tax yields on fixed maturities decreased to in  compared to in  due to the lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates since first quarter of management expects its investment results to be negatively affected by lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates in  defaults in the fixed maturities portfolio and by the transfer of million to fund the property and casualty companies portion of the additional minimum pension liability recorded by afc at december  the decrease in net investment income in  compared to  primarily reflects the impact of fixed maturities that defaulted and a reduction in average invested assets  partially offset by an increase in average pre tax yields on fixed maturities 
average invested assets decreased million  or  to  million in  compared to  million in average pre tax yields on fixed maturities increased to in  compared to in  due to the shift in investment strategy providing for investments in taxable securities instead of tax exempt securities  to maximize after tax investment yields 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses overview of loss reserve estimation process the risk management segment maintains reserves for its property and casualty products to provide for the company s ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these reserves are estimates  involving actuarial projections at a given point in time  of what management expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known  estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and policy coverage  and other factors 
the amount of loss and lae reserves is determined based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process is judgmental  and requires the company to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims on type of business and nature of claim bases 
using data obtained from this monitoring and assumptions about emerging trends  the company develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions  which vary by line of business  used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
because the amount of the loss and lae reserves are sensitive to the company s assumptions  the company does not completely rely on only one estimate to determine its loss and lae reserves 
rather  the company develops several estimates using generally recognized actuarial projection methodologies that result in a range of possible loss and lae reserve outcomes  the company s best estimate is within that range 
because certain projection methodologies may not result in a reasonable reserve estimate for a particular line of business due to certain underlying data assumptions  the company may determine that the low or high end range estimate calculated by the method does not represent a reasonable estimate 
when trends emerge that the company believes affect the future settlement of claims  the company will adjust its reserves accordingly 
management s review of judgements and key assumptions the inherent uncertainty of estimating insurance reserves is greater for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines  particularly workers compensation and other liability lines  where a longer period of time may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability may be made  and where the technological  judicial and political climates involving these types of claims are changing 
the company has maintained a historical practice to significantly limit the issuance of certain long tailed other liability policies  including directors and officers d o liability  errors and omissions e o liability and medical malpractice liability  in which the industry has experienced recent adverse loss trends 
the company regularly updates its reserve estimates as new information becomes available and further events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled claims 
reserve adjustments are reflected in results of operations as adjustments to losses and lae 
often these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are described as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable on the financial results of the company 
inflation generally increases the cost of losses covered by insurance contracts 
the effect of inflation on the company varies by product 
property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and lae  and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses are known 
consequently  the company attempts  in establishing rates and reserves  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in the projection of ultimate costs 
recently  the company has experienced increasing medical costs associated with personal automobile personal injury protection claims 
this increase is reflected in the company s reserve estimates  but continued increases could contribute to increased losses and lae in the future 
the company regularly reviews its reserving techniques  its overall reserving position and its reinsurance 
based on i review of historical data  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in impositions of damages and policy coverage  political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions  ii review of per claim information  iii historical loss experience of the company and the industry  iv the relatively short term nature of most policies and v internal estimates of required reserves  management believes that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
a significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on the results of operations 
loss reserves by line of business the company performs actuarial reviews on certain detailed line of business coverages 
these individual estimates are summarized into six broader lines of business  personal automobile  homeowners  workers compensation  commercial automobile  commercial multiple peril  and other lines 
the table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending reserve for unpaid losses and lae as follows for the years ended december in millions reserve for losses and lae  beginning of year    incurred losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverable provision for insured events of current year    increase decrease in provision for insured events of prior years losses related to selected property casualty exited agencies  policies  groups programs for current year total incurred losses and lae    payments  net of reinsurance recoverable losses and lae attributable to insured events of current year losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior years total payments    change in reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses reserve for losses and lae  end of year    the increase in provision for insured events of prior years in includes million of losses related to selected property and casualty exited agencies  policies  groups and programs and million of losses related to voluntary pool claims 
as part of an ongoing process  the reserves have been re estimated for all prior accident years and were increased by million and million in and  respectively  and decreased by million in the table below summarizes the reserve for losses and lae by line of business 
for the years ended december in millions personal automobile  homeowners and other total personal    workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial total commercial    total reserve for losses and lae    prior year development by line of business when trends emerge that the company believes affect the future settlement of claims  the company will adjust its reserves accordingly 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as adjustments to losses and loss adjustment expenses 
often  these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are disclosed and discussed separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to the financial results of the company 
the table below summarizes the change in provision for insured events of prior years by line of business 
in millions increase decrease in loss provision for insured events of prior years personal automobile homeowners and other total personal workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial total commercial increase decrease in loss provision for insured events of prior years decrease in lae provision for insured events of prior years increase decrease in total loss and lae provision for insured events of prior years during the year ended december  and  estimated loss reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed unfavorably by million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   estimated loss reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by million 
the adverse development in both and  is primarily the result of increased claim severity related to personal automobile medical settlements for citizens 
since these settlements have risen beyond previous estimates  reserve increases have been recognized in the period in which the information is obtained 
the increase in the prior year reserve estimates for other commercial lines during is primarily due to the recognition of approximately million in additional reserves for asbestos claims in the excess and casualty reinsurance association ecra voluntary pool 
in addition  the company experienced adverse development in as a result of the million reserve increase on prior years resulting from the agency management actions discussed in selected property casualty exited agencies  policies  groups programs 
this reserve increase affected primarily the commercial multiple peril  personal automobile  commercial automobile and workers compensation lines 
additionally  other commercial lines prior year reserves developed adversely due to a million reserve increase in the ecra voluntary pool 
personal automobile prior year reserves developed adversely due to the aforementioned increased claim severity related to medical settlements for citizens 
in addition to the effect from the agency management actions  the commercial automobile and commercial multiple peril lines experienced adverse development 
the increased reserves in these lines is primarily attributable to increased claim payments in the and accident years 
as these payments have increased above historical amounts  actuarial projections of future settlements have increased the estimated ultimate reserves on prior years 
during  the favorable loss development is primarily the result of a decrease in prior year reserves in the personal automobile line 
the company began to experience an improvement in the northeast in the personal automobile line as claim payment severity began to decrease in accident years and as the certainty of the improvement in claim payment severity for accident years and increased  ultimate losses for those accident years were reduced and favorable development was recorded during calendar year during the years ended december   and  estimated lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by million  million and million  respectively 
the favorable development in all the periods is primarily attributable to claims process improvement initiatives taken by the company during the to calendar year period 
since  the company has lowered claim settlement costs through increased utilization of in house attorneys and consolidation of claim offices 
as actual experience begins to establish certain trends inherent within the claim settlement process  the actuarial process recognizes these trends within the reserving methodology impacting future claim settlement assumptions 
as these measures improved average settlement costs  the actuarial estimate of future settlement costs are reduced and favorable development is recorded 
these measures are complete 
reserves established for current year losses and lae in and consider the factors that resulted in the favorable development of prior years loss and lae reserves during and earlier years 
accordingly  current year reserves are modestly lower  relative to those initially established for similar exposures in years prior to asbestos and environmental reserves although the company does not specifically underwrite policies that include asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability  the company may be required to defend such claims 
the table below summarizes direct business asbestos and environmental reserves net of reinsurance and excluding pools in millions environ environ environ asbestos mental total asbestos mental total asbestos mental total beginning reserves incurred losses lae paid losses lae ending reserves ending loss and lae reserves for all direct business written by its property and casualty companies related to asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability  included in the reserve for losses and lae  were million  million and million  net of reinsurance of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the outstanding reserves for direct business asbestos and environmental damage have remained relatively consistent for the three year period ended december  as a result of the company s historical direct underwriting mix of commercial lines policies toward smaller and middle market risks  past asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability loss experience has remained minimal in relation to the company s total loss and lae incurred experience 
the company estimates its ultimate liability for these claims based upon currently known facts  reasonable assumptions where the facts are not known  current law and methodologies currently available 
although these outstanding claims are not significant  their existence gives rise to uncertainty and are discussed because of the possibility that they may become significant 
the company believes that  notwithstanding the evolution of case law expanding liability in asbestos and environmental claims  recorded reserves related to these claims are adequate 
in addition  the company is not aware of any litigation or pending claims that are expected to result in additional material liabilities in excess of recorded reserves 
the environmental liability could be revised in the near term if the estimates used in determining the liability are revised 
in addition  the company has established loss and lae reserves for assumed reinsurance and pool business with asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
these reserves relate to pools in which the company has terminated its participation  however  the company continues to be subject to claims related to years in which it was a participant 
the company was a participant in ecra from to in  the pool was dissolved and since that time the business has been in runoff 
the company s participation in this pool has resulted in average paid losses of million annually over the past ten years 
during  the pool commissioned an independent actuarial review of its then current reserve position  which noted a range of reserve deficiency primarily as a result of adverse development of asbestos claims 
as a result of this study  the company recorded an additional million of losses in the fourth quarter of this reserving action has been presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of income and has been excluded from adjusted net income due to management s belief that this item is not indicative of overall operating trends 
because of the inherent uncertainty regarding the types of claims in these pools  there can be no assurance that these reserves will be sufficient 
during  the company recorded an additional million of loss reserves related to ecra 
selected property casualty exited agencies  policies  groups programs during the fourth quarter of  the company completed an extensive review of its agency relationships which resulted in the termination of agencies and the withdrawal of commercial lines underwriting authority from an additional agencies 
these actions affected approximately of approximately  active agencies representing the company in these agencies had consistently produced unsatisfactory loss ratios 
in addition  the company terminated virtually all of its specialty commercial programs and discontinued a number of special marketing arrangements 
the total earned premium associated with the exited business was million and million in and  respectively  and is estimated to be approximately million in the company is contractually or under statutory regulations obligated to renew policies with certain agents that will continue to be in runoff in the estimated future premium deficiency on these policies is million and this loss was recorded during in connection with these actions  the company performed an actuarial review of outstanding reserves with segregated loss history on the exited business 
based on this review  an increase to reserves of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of this increase includes million of adverse development in the current year and million of adverse development on prior year reserves  which is net of a million benefit from the aforementioned aggregate excess of loss reinsurance treaty 
under the aggregate excess of loss reinsurance treaty  the company recognized a net benefit of million  including the aforementioned million benefit related to prior year reserves 
in addition  as a result of projected future losses on the exited business  the company recorded an impairment to the dac asset of million 
this resulted in an increase in policy acquisition expenses and a decrease in the company s dac asset balance as of december  the total charge of million has been presented as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of income and has been excluded from adjusted net income due to management s belief that this item is not indicative of overall operating trends 
actual future losses from the exited business may vary from the company s estimate 
reinsurance the risk management segment maintains a reinsurance program designed to protect against large or unusual losses and allocated lae activity 
this includes excess of loss reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance 
the company determines the appropriate amount of reinsurance based on the company s evaluation of the risks accepted and analyses prepared by consultants and reinsurers and on market conditions including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the company from its obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the company 
the company believes that the terms of its reinsurance contracts are consistent with industry practice in that they contain standard terms with respect to lines of business covered  limit and retention  arbitration and occurrence 
based on its review of its reinsurers financial statements and reputations in the reinsurance marketplace  the company believes that its reinsurers are financially sound 
catastrophe reinsurance serves to protect the ceding insurer from significant losses arising from a single event such as windstorm  hail  hurricane  tornado  riot or other extraordinary events 
under the company s catastrophe reinsurance agreements  the company ceded million of losses in as the result of deterioration in the accident year and million of losses in the company  in  entered into a whole account aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement  which provides coverage for accident year for the company s property and casualty business 
the program covered losses and allocated lae  including those incurred but not yet reported  in excess of a specified whole account loss and allocated lae ratio 
the coverage limit for losses and allocated lae is million 
the effect of this agreement on results of operations in each reporting period is based on losses and allocated lae ceded  reduced by a sliding scale premium of depending on the size of the loss  and increased by a ceding commission of of ceded premium 
in addition  net investment income is reduced for amounts credited to the reinsurer 
as a result of this agreement  the company recognized a net expense of million for the year ended december  and net benefits of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  based on estimates of losses and allocated lae for accident year the impact from this treaty includes a million net benefit related to the aforementioned exit of selected property and casualty agencies  policies  groups and programs 
the effect of this agreement on the results of operations in future periods is not currently determinable  as it will be based both on future losses and allocated lae for accident year the company  in the risk management segment  is subject to concentration of risk with respect to reinsurance ceded to various residual market mechanisms 
as a condition to the ability to conduct certain business in various states  the company is required to participate in various residual market mechanisms and pooling arrangements which provide various insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that are otherwise unable to purchase such coverage 
these market mechanisms and pooling arrangements include the massachusetts commonwealth automobile reinsurers and the michigan catastrophic claims association 
asset accumulation allmerica financial services prior to september   the allmerica financial services segment manufactured and sold variable annuities  variable universal life and traditional life insurance products  as well as certain group retirement products 
on september   the company announced plans to consider strategic alternatives  including a significant reduction of sales of proprietary variable annuities and variable life insurance products 
this resulted from the effect of the significant  persistent decline in the equity market  culminating in the third quarter of  that followed the decline in the second quarter  as well as the ratings downgrades see rating agency actions 
subsequently  the company ceased all new sales of proprietary variable annuities and life insurance products see description of operating segments 
as a result of the changes with afs  the factors that affect this segment s results of operations after september  are substantially different from those in effect prior to that date 
the substantial changes in dac and other assumptions resulting from the segment s change in operations are reflected in the results for the year  discussed in subsequent paragraphs 
in addition  the fourth quarter results of operations are substantially different from results achieved by this segment in the past  and  in fact  the company believes these results are more indicative of results of operations to be expected in the near term  therefore  a separate discussion of the last three months of the year is included immediately following the year over year discussion below 
the following table summarizes the results of operations for the allmerica financial services segment 
for the years ended december in millions segment revenues premiums fees fees from surrenders other proprietary product fees net investment income brokerage and investment management income other income total segment revenues policy benefits  claims and losses policy acquisition costs brokerage and investment management variable expenses other operating expenses segment loss income brokerage and investment management income primarily reflects fees earned from the distribution and management of non proprietary insurance and investment products 
variable expenses related to this business primarily consist of commissions 
compared to segment results deteriorated million  to a loss of million during this loss reflects net charges of million resulting from the effect of the significant  persistent decline in equity market values during the most recent three years  culminating in the third quarter  as well as ratings downgrades see rating agency actions  and the company s decision to cease new sales of proprietary life insurance and annuity products 
these charges include million of additional amortization of the dac asset  a change in the assumptions related to the long term cost of gmdb for variable annuity products resulting in a reserve increase of million  partially offset by a reduction in dac amortization of million  and the recognition of impairments of capitalized technology costs associated with variable products totaling million 
the following table summarizes the aforementioned charges and benefits for each is explained in subsequent paragraphs 
in millions additional dac amortization revision of surrender rate assumptions equity market depreciation revision of market related appreciation assumptions revision of gmdb long term cost assumptions revision of future fees assumption impairment of dac asset gmdb revision of long term cost assumptions reduction of dac amortization impairment of capitalized technology costs total deferred acquisition costs as discussed further in critical accounting policies  dac for variable life products and variable annuities consists of commissions  underwriting costs and other costs which are amortized in proportion to the total gross profits that the company estimates will be earned over the expected life of the insurance contracts to which such costs relate 
to estimate the profitability of its insurance contracts  the company establishes and applies certain assumptions relating to  among other matters  appreciation of account assets  contract persistency and contract costs such as those relating to any gmdb feature and fees payable to distributors 
the company regularly evaluates these assumptions to determine whether recent experience or anticipated trends merit adjustments to such assumptions 
the substantial and sustained decline in the equity market  culminating in the third quarter  precipitated a number of significant events which caused the company to incur large increases in dac amortization 
these included  in large part  substantial ratings downgrades  which contributed to the company s decision to cease new sales of proprietary variable annuity and life products 
the company believes that this business decision will adversely affect the profitability of its existing policies and contracts by significantly decreasing the persistency of customer accounts 
decreased persistency also will increase the cost of the gmdb feature of variable annuity contracts  further reducing profitability 
this results from a reduction of revenues in future periods due to a decline in average invested assets  whereby the revenues will not be sufficient to offset gmdb claims in the near term 
in addition  the market decline resulted in significant differences in actual account value investment returns from those assumed 
this required the company to substantially increase the level of dac amortization and gmdb expense under existing assumptions and to reassess the appropriate long term assumptions on account appreciation and gmdb cost 
as a result  the company revised downward its assumptions regarding future account appreciation and increased its expectations regarding the long term cost of the gmdb feature 
finally  the company s evaluation of the compounding effects of the market decline and afs business model changes on the anticipated profitability of its distribution channels caused the company to determine that there had been a permanent impairment of the remaining dac asset related to its former partners distribution channel see statutory premiums and deposits for a description of the former distribution channels 
each of these increased costs and changed assumptions are discussed further below 
the aforementioned million of additional dac amortization consists of six separate items 
first  the company anticipates that the ratings downgrades see rating agency actions and the company s decision to cease new sales of proprietary life insurance and annuity products will unfavorably affect the persistency of the existing customer accounts  as customers seek to transfer their accounts to companies who are active in the marketplace and have higher ratings 
this reduces expected future profits  resulting in million of additional dac amortization 
second  significant declines in equity market values resulted in additional amortization of million in this resulted from application of the company s reversion to the mean accounting methodology 
the company considers the recent declines to be suggestive of a permanent  partial reduction in future profitability 
third  as of september   the company reviewed and reset its assumptions regarding future market related appreciation of separate account assets and its application of the reversion to the mean accounting methodology 
in view of the additional market declines in the third quarter  as well as the reduced time horizon resulting from the revised persistency expectations  the company reduced its expected rate of annual appreciation to per quarter  starting with september  asset levels 
this reduces expected future profits  resulting in million of additional dac amortization 
fourth  the company increased its assumptions related to the long term cost of gmdb for variable annuity products as of september  see the discussion of the gmdb reserve below 
the increased cost estimates affected the company s expectation of future gross profits  resulting in additional dac amortization of million in fifth  the company changed its estimate of future fees from certain annuity products in the second quarter of this decreased dac amortization by million in that quarter 
finally  the company recognized additional amortization of million related to its partners distribution channel see statutory premiums and deposits for a description of the former distribution channels 
after reviewing all assumptions affecting future profits assumed in its dac methodology  including the effect of the aforementioned adjustments  the company determined that the remaining dac asset related to partners exceeded the present value of total expected gross profits by million as of september  accordingly  the company recognized a permanent impairment to its dac asset of this amount 
it should be noted that a permanent impairment is not required for the other distribution channels because of their higher expected profitability 
relative to the other distribution channels  partners has the highest gmdb costs and the lowest fees from its underlying mutual funds 
after september   the company expects that dac amortization will be  in general  higher than historical levels as a percentage of gross profits 
this is due to lower future gross profits  because of poorer persistency  lower expected market related appreciation and higher expected gmdb costs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company experienced higher dac amortization than in prior periods 
the company expects a similar level of amortization as a percentage of gross profits in however  as a result of resetting the long term assumption for market related appreciation and applying the reversion to the mean accounting methodology  the company believes that dac amortization will be less sensitive to short term market movements than in the first nine months of the company is exposed to further impairments to the dac asset if actual experience is worse than the current assumptions 
in particular  the select dac asset would be subject to impairment should actual gross profits be moderately less than anticipated 
impairments would increase dac amortization in the period that they are recognized 
guaranteed minimum death benefits as noted above  as of september   the company increased its assumptions related to the long term cost of gmdb for variable annuity products 
the gmdb feature provides annuity contract holders with a guarantee that the benefit received at death will be no less than a prescribed minimum amount 
this minimum amount is based on the net deposits paid into the contract  the net deposits accumulated at a specified rate  the highest historical account value on a contract anniversary  or more typically the greatest of these values 
to the extent that the gmdb is higher than the current account value at the time of death  the company incurs a cost 
as of december   the difference between the gmdb and the current account value the net amount at risk for all existing contracts was approximately billion 
for each one percent change  either increase or decrease from december  levels in the s p index  the net amount at risk is estimated to increase or decrease by approximately million to million 
this amount will gradually decline as surrenders also reduce the net amount at risk 
to estimate the cost of the gmdb feature with respect to the profitability of the related insurance contract  the company establishes and applies certain assumptions relating to the appreciation of related account assets  mortality and contract persistency  among other matters 
the company regularly evaluates these assumptions to determine whether recent experience or anticipated trends merit adjustments to such assumptions 
the compounding effects of the significant third quarter market decline  the ratings downgrades  increased annuity surrenders and related afs strategic business changes resulted in significantly decreased account values and persistency assumptions which required the company to reassess  and increase  its assumptions related to the long term cost of gmdb 
the company has had a consistent policy of providing reserves for gmdb based on its best estimate of the long term cost of gmdb 
as of september   the company reassessed its expectation of the long term cost of gmdb in view of the current net amount at risk and the revised persistency expectations  as well as the absence of additional deposits at current market levels 
this resulted in revised expectations for the long term cost of gmdb 
the company calculated a reserve at september  of million  and recognized this amount in policy benefits 
this was partially offset by a reduction in dac amortization of million 
it should be noted that in addition to the reserve increase  policy benefits during include million of additional gmdb expense  versus million in the prior year 
these amounts were partially offset by reduced dac amortization of million and million  respectively 
based on account values as of december   the estimated annual gmdb expense would be approximately million 
in the near term  cash costs will likely exceed the annual expense  thereby reducing the reserve 
expected appreciation in asset levels would gradually reduce  and eventually reverse  this difference over time 
there can be no assurance that the existing reserve will be sufficient  or that the company s estimate of long term gmdb costs is accurate or sufficient 
future changes in market levels  persistency of existing accounts  mortality and other factors may result in material changes to gmdb costs and related expenses 
technology costs the company also recognized million of asset impairments related to technology used in its variable annuity and variable universal life business  reflected in other operating expenses 
of this amount  million relates to capitalized software development costs 
the remaining million relates to technology hardware 
during the past five years  the company has incurred costs to develop technology platforms for its variable products 
this includes the technology used to underwrite  issue and maintain customer accounts  incorporating disparate and complex product attributes 
as a result of the ratings downgrades see rating agency actions  and the company s decision to cease new sales of proprietary life insurance and annuity products  the company determined that expected future cash flows do not support continued capitalization of the entire cost of the technology assets 
accordingly  the company recognized the aforementioned permanent impairment in other operating expenses 
fees during  fees from surrenders increased million  or  to million as a result of increased annuity surrenders  primarily in the fourth quarter as a result of the ratings downgrades 
this increase was partially offset by a million decline in all other fees related to the proprietary products  primarily resulting from lower average invested assets 
compared to segment income decreased million  or  to million in this decrease primarily reflects lower asset based fees and other income  as well as an increase in policy benefits and other operating expenses  net of lower deferred acquisition costs 
the decline in asset based fees and other income is principally attributable to a decrease in the market value of assets under management in the variable product lines  and to lower brokerage income 
segment revenues decreased million  or  in  primarily due to lower asset based fees and other income 
fee income decreased million  or  to million  primarily due to variable annuity fees which decreased million  or 
this was primarily due to a decline in the market value of average variable annuity assets under management 
in addition  group annuity and non variable universal life policy fees decreased million and million  respectively  during these declines were primarily due to lower average invested assets resulting from the company s decision to exit its defined contribution group retirement business and from the continued shift in focus to variable life insurance and annuity products 
additionally  the decline in non variable universal life fees included approximately million due to changes in certain actuarial assumptions in these decreases in fees were partially offset by a million increase in variable universal life fees principally due to additional deposits 
other income decreased million  or  to million 
this decline was primarily due to lower investment management fees of million resulting from depreciation and reduced deposits in variable product assets under management as well as to lower brokerage income of million resulting from a decrease in mutual fund and general securities transaction volumes 
net investment income increased million primarily due to additional income from the investment of higher general account deposits  partially offset by the impact of defaulted bonds  lower average mortgage investments and yields  and to the aforementioned decision to exit the defined contribution group retirement business 
policy benefits  claims and losses increased million  or  to million in  primarily due to increased interest credited of approximately million related to an increase in general account deposits 
additionally  during  the gmdb expense increased million  primarily due to the sustained decline in the financial markets in the second half of policy acquisition and other operating expenses increased million  or  to million in other operating expenses increased approximately million  primarily due to increases in technology and distribution costs  partially offset by lower brokerage commissions and administrative expenses due to the aforementioned decrease in trading volumes for mutual fund and general securities transactions 
in addition  other operating expenses in included a million net reduction in premium tax and guaranty fund reserves 
policy acquisition expenses decreased million  or  to million 
in  policy acquisition expense reflects a refinement in the methodology used by the company s deferred policy acquisition cost valuation system which decreased amortization expense by approximately million 
included in policy acquisition expenses in were several unusual items  particularly approximately million of reduced expenses related to a change in certain life products actuarial assumptions and an increase in policy acquisition expenses of approximately million in the annuity line of business  resulting from an increase in assumed lapse rates 
excluding the effects of the aforementioned unusual items  policy acquisition costs declined approximately million  primarily due to lower variable annuity profits 
since variable products deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to gross profits  the lower annuity gross profits in resulted in less amortization expense 
quarter ended december  compared to quarter ended december  the following table summarizes the results of operations for the allmerica financial services segment for the quarter ended december  compared to the quarter ended december  as previously mentioned  the factors that affect this segment s results of operations after september  are substantially different from those in effect prior to that date 
accordingly  the company believes that the results of operations for the last three months of the year are more indicative of results of operations to be expected in for the quarter ended december in millions segment revenues premiums fees fees from surrenders other fees from proprietary products net investment income brokerage and investment management income other income total segment revenues policy benefits  claims and losses policy acquisition costs brokerage and investment management variable expenses other operating expenses segment loss income brokerage and investment management income primarily reflects fees earned from the distribution and management of non proprietary insurance and investment products 
variable expenses related to this business primarily consist of commissions 
segment results deteriorated million  to a loss of million in the fourth quarter of the approximate break even result in resulted from substantially higher amortization of dac  partially offset by increased surrender fees and net fees earned from sales of non proprietary products 
the company s decision to cease sales of proprietary products and the aforementioned ratings downgrades resulted in an expected substantial increase in surrenders of variable annuities in the fourth quarter 
annuity surrenders in the fourth quarter of were billion versus million in the fourth quarter of the prior year 
the increased surrenders resulted in additional surrender fees of million in  representing all of the increase in fees during the quarter 
however  the additional fees were substantially offset by additional related dac amortization of approximately million  reflecting the company s current dac assumptions mandating a higher amortization level as a percentage of gross annuity profits 
the remainder of the increase in dac amortization of approximately million  to million  during the quarter results from applying this higher amortization percentage to current profits generated by existing annuity accounts see deferred acquisition costs above 
during the fourth quarter of  afs increased its sales of non proprietary products  consistent with its new strategy 
such sales are made through veravest 
an increase to million  versus million in the prior year  resulted in additional brokerage and investment management income of million in the quarter  reflected in brokerage and investment management income 
these fees were substantially offset by additional commissions paid to the segment s registered representatives of million  reflected in other brokerage and investment management variable operating expenses 
the increase in other operating expenses reflects primarily acquisition costs that had been deferred in  as they related to proprietary annuity and insurance sales that are no longer offered by the company 
since distribution efforts have shifted to the development of non proprietary sales  these costs are no longer eligible for deferral under gaap 
policy benefits in the fourth quarter of were relatively consistent with the prior year 
expenses related to gmdb declined modestly  from million to million in the quarter ended december  finally  net investment income declined million in the fourth quarter of  to million 
this resulted from lower average general account assets and the effect of defaults and non income producing investments in the company s portfolio of fixed income securities 
given the changes in the afs business  the company believes the factors affecting profitability in the past are not indicative of how the future earnings of this segment will be generated 
the future profitability of the afs segment  including that of veravest  is dependent upon  among other things  the ability to generate profitable non proprietary sales  the ability to rationalize its expense structure for the non proprietary business and existing insurance business consistent with its new business strategy  equity market levels and the persistency of existing insurance customer accounts 
the company does not expect this segment to be a significant source of earnings in the near term 
effective december   the company sold its universal life insurance business see significant transactions sale of universal life insurance business 
during the fourth quarter of  the universal life business contributed incremental income of million 
statutory premiums and deposits the following table sets forth statutory premiums and deposits by product for the allmerica financial services segment 
for the years ended december in millions insurance traditional life universal life variable universal life individual health group variable universal life total insurance annuities separate account annuities    general account annuities retirement investment accounts total individual annuities    group annuities total annuities    total premiums and deposits    compared to for the year ended december   total premiums and deposits decreased million  or  to billion 
these decreases were primarily due to lower group annuity deposits resulting from the company s decision to cease marketing activities for new group retirement business and to lower individual annuity deposits  entirely in the fourth quarter of  resulting from the aforementioned ratings downgrades and decision to cease all new sales of proprietary products 
group variable universal life deposits decreased due to the cessation of marketing activities for this product 
during the fourth quarter of  total premiums and deposits declined significantly compared to the same period in see statutory premiums and deposits quarter ended december  compared to quarter ended december  below 
effective december   the company sold substantially all of its fixed universal life insurance business see significant transactions sale of universal life insurance business 
prior to the cessation of sales of the company s proprietary products  annuity products were distributed primarily through three distribution channels agency  which consisted of the company s former career agency force  select  which consisted of a network of third party broker dealers  and partners  which included distributors of the mutual funds advised by scudder investments scudder  pioneer investment management  inc and delaware management company delaware 
agency  select  and partners represented  respectively  approximately   and of individual annuity deposits in  and scudder represented of all individual annuity deposits 
during  agency  select  and partners represented  respectively  approximately   and of individual annuity deposits  and scudder represented of all individual annuity deposits 
compared to for the year ended december   total premiums and deposits decreased million  or  to  million 
these decreases are primarily due to lower separate account and group annuity deposits  partially offset by higher general account deposits 
in addition  group annuity deposits decreased due to the company s decision to exit its defined contribution retirement plan business and to cease marketing activities for new defined benefit retirement business 
partially offsetting these decreases were higher annuity deposits into the company s general account resulting  in part  from the introduction of a promotional annuity program  which offered an enhanced initial crediting rate for new general account deposits 
quarter ended december  compared to quarter ended december  the following table sets forth statutory premiums and deposits by product for the afs segment for the quarter ended december  compared to the quarter ended december  for the quarter ended december in millions insurance traditional life universal life variable universal life individual health group variable universal life total insurance annuities separate account annuities general account annuities retirement investment accounts total individual annuities group annuities total annuities total premiums and deposits the substantial decline in statutory premiums and deposits from to is due to the aforementioned decision to cease all new sales of proprietary variable annuities and life insurance products 
the company implemented this decision during the month of october  implementation was substantially complete by the end of that month 
accordingly  statutory premiums and deposits during the fourth quarter of reflect primarily new sales during the month of october 
future statutory premiums and deposits will be substantially less  since they will only include additional premiums and deposits either allowed or required by existing contracts

the fourth quarter level of surrender activity is consistent with management s expectations and with the surrender rate assumptions included in the company s calculation of its dac asset and its gmdb reserve at december  allmerica asset management the following table summarizes the results of operations for the allmerica asset management segment 
for the years ended december in millions interest margins on gics net investment income interest credited net interest margin premium financing business fees operating expenses net premium financing income fees and other income external internal other operating expenses segment income average gic deposits outstanding    outstanding gic deposits  end of year    compared to segment income increased million  or  to million in primarily due to the inclusion of million of earnings related to the company s premium financing subsidiary  amgro  in  which was previously included in the risk management segment 
in addition  segment income increased due to an increase in fees and other income related to external clients  offset by lower earnings on gics 
new external assets under management resulted in an increase in earnings from asset management services provided to external clients 
earnings on gics decreased million primarily due to lower net investment income and to withdrawals of short term funding agreements 
net investment income declined primarily due to lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates  and to the effect of defaults on certain fixed maturities supporting gic obligations 
declining financial strength ratings from various rating agencies during see rating agency actions resulted in the termination of all remaining short term funding agreements  and ultimately  the company ceased selling new long term funding agreements 
furthermore the company retired certain funding agreements at discounts during the fourth quarter of although these retirements resulted in a gain for the company see consolidated overview  income from the gic product line will be unfavorably affected in future periods due to the declining balance of outstanding gic deposits 
the company uses derivative instruments to hedge its gic portfolio see derivative instruments 
for floating rate gic liabilities that are matched with fixed rate securities  the company manages the interest rate risk by hedging with interest rate swap contracts designed to pay fixed and receive floating interest 
in addition  certain funding agreements are denominated in foreign currencies 
to mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates  the company regularly hedges this risk by entering into foreign exchange swap  futures and options contracts  as well as compound foreign currency interest rate swap contracts to hedge its net foreign currency exposure 
these hedges resulted in a million and a million reduction in net investment income during and  respectively  offset by similar reductions in gic interest credited during the respective periods 
the decreased effect of derivative instruments was due to a decrease in average outstanding gic deposits and the associated hedges 
although the company believes its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations are currently economically hedged  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses from ineffective hedges in the future 
compared to segment income decreased million  or  to million in primarily due to decreased earnings on gics and to lower earnings related to external clients 
earnings on gics decreased million primarily due to a shift from short term funding agreements to lower margin long term funding agreements in and to lower investment income due to defaults on certain bonds supporting gic obligations 
these declines were partially offset by increased earnings from higher net gic deposits during the year 
the decrease in earnings related to external clients resulted from a decrease in management fees from a securitized investment portfolio  partially offset by an increase in new external assets under management 
in the fourth quarter of  the company was notified of short term funding agreement withdrawals of approximately million which resulted from uncertainty regarding the rating agency actions when moody s investors service placed the company s a senior debt rating  a capital securities rating  and p short term debt rating on review for possible downgrade and revised the outlook for the life insurance companies ratings to negative from stable 
these withdrawals precipitated losses from related interest rate swap contracts as described in derivative instruments 
as noted above  the company uses derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and currency exchange rate risks related to its gic portfolio 
these hedges resulted in a million and a million reduction in net investment income during and  respectively  offset by similar reductions in gic interest credited during the respective periods 
the increased effect of derivative instruments in was due to an increase in average outstanding gic deposits and the associated hedges

for the years ended december in millions segment revenues investment and other income interest expense other operating expenses segment loss compared to segment loss decreased million  or  to million in  primarily as a result of decreased corporate overhead costs of million  including lower costs due to forfeited stock grants by the company s president as a result of his resignation  partially offset by a million decrease in net investment income 
the decrease in net investment income is principally due to lower average invested assets and to lower investment yields 
interest expense for both periods relates to the interest paid on the senior debentures of the company 
compared to segment loss increased million  or  to million in  primarily as a result of increased corporate overhead costs  including technology costs and certain corporate overhead expenses previously allocated to other operating segments  partially offset by state tax credits recognized by the holding company 
investment portfolio the company held general account investment assets diversified across several asset classes  as follows december in millions of total of total carrying carrying carrying carrying value value value value fixed maturities   equity securities mortgages policy loans cash and cash equivalents other long term investments total   the company carries these investments at fair value 
total investment assets decreased billion  or  to billion during  primarily as a result of a decrease in fixed maturities of billion 
fixed maturities decreased primarily due to short term funding agreement withdrawals and the retirement of certain long term funding agreements in the aam segment 
in addition  fixed maturities decreased in the afs segment due to annuity surrenders from the general account  as well as transfers to the separate accounts from the general account  which together more than offset million of new deposits in the general account in during  approximately million of investment assets will be used for the settlement of the net payable associated with the sale of the company s universal life insurance business see significant transactions sale of universal life insurance business 
the company s fixed maturity portfolio is comprised primarily of investment grade corporate securities  tax exempt issues of state and local governments  us government and agency securities and other issues 
based on ratings by the national association of insurance commissioners naic  investment grade securities comprised and of the company s total fixed maturity portfolio at december  and  respectively 
although management expects that new funds will be invested primarily in cash  cash equivalents and investment grade fixed maturities  the company may invest a portion of new funds in below investment grade fixed maturities or equity securities 
the average yield on fixed maturities was and for december  and  respectively 
this decline reflects lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates since the first quarter of due to the current interest rate environment  management expects its investment yield to be negatively affected by lower prevailing fixed maturity investment rates in as of december  and  million and million  respectively  of the company s fixed maturities were invested in non publicly traded securities 
fair values of non publicly traded securities are determined by either a third party broker or by internally developed pricing models  including the use of discounted cash flow analyses 
principally as a result of the company s exposure to below investment grade securities  the company recognized million and million of realized losses on other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities in included million related to the communication sector  million related to the airline sector  million related to the utility sector  million related to securitized investments  and million related to the energy sector 
other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities in included million related to the communication sector  million related to securitized investments  million related to the industrial sector  million related to the metals sector  and million related to the energy sector 
the losses reflect the continued deterioration of high yield securities in the company s portfolio 
in addition  the company recognized million and million of realized losses on other than temporary impairments of equity securities and other long term investments for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in the company s determination of other than temporary impairments  management considers several factors and circumstances  including the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  the issuer s financial performance  including earnings trends  dividend payments  and asset quality  a weakening of the general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  a prolonged period typically six months or longer in which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below the company s cost  and with respect to fixed maturity investments  any factors that might raise doubt about the issuer s ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms 
the company applies these factors to all securities 
other than temporary impairments are recorded as a realized loss  which serves to reduce net income and earnings per share 
temporary losses are recorded as unrealized losses  which do not affect net income and earnings per share but reduce other comprehensive income 
no assurance can be given that the other than temporary impairments will  in fact  be adequate to cover future losses or that substantial additional impairments will not be required in the future 
the following table for the years ended december  and provides information about the company s fixed maturities and equity securities that are in a gross unrealized loss position 
december in millions gross gross unrealized fair unrealized fair losses value losses value for greater than months for less than months  total fixed maturities and equity securities  the gross unrealized losses of fixed maturities and equity securities are viewed as being temporary as it is management s assessment that these securities will recover in the near term 
furthermore  as of december   the company has the intent and ability to retain such investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for this anticipated recovery in fair value 
of the million and million of gross unrealized losses of fixed maturities and equity securities at december  and  respectively  that have been in such a position for greater than months  million and million have been in a significant unrealized loss position typically those securities with a fair value less than of amortized cost as of december  and  respectively 
the risks inherent in the assessment methodology include the risk that  subsequent to the balance sheet date  market factors may differ from management s expectations  management may decide to subsequently sell a security for unforeseen business needs  or changes in the credit assessment or equity characteristics from the company s original assessment may lead the company to determine that a sale at the current value would maximize recovery on such investments 
to the extent that there are such adverse changes  the unrealized loss would then be realized and the company would record a charge to earnings 
the following table sets forth gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities by maturity period  and for equity securities 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties  or the company may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers 
mortgage backed securities are included in the category representing their ultimate maturity 
december in millions due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years total fixed maturities equity securities total fixed maturities and equity securities of the million and million of gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities  approximately million and million relates to investment grade fixed maturity obligations of the us treasury  us government and agency securities  states and political subdivisions  as of december  and  respectively 
an additional million and million of gross unrealized losses relates to holdings of investment grade fixed maturities in a variety of industries and sectors  while approximately million and million relates to holdings of below investment grade fixed maturities and equity securities in a variety of industries and sectors as of december  and  respectively 
substantially all below investment grade securities with an unrealized loss have been rated by the naic  standard poor s or moody s as of december  and the company had fixed maturity securities with a carrying value of million and million on non accrual status at december  and  respectively 
the effect of non accruals  compared with amounts that would have been recognized in accordance with the original terms of the fixed maturities  was a reduction in net investment income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
management expects that defaults in the fixed maturities portfolio may continue to negatively impact investment income 
derivative instruments the company enters into various types of interest rate swap contracts to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate funding agreement liabilities that are matched with fixed rate securities 
the company also enters into foreign currency swap  futures and options contracts  as well as compound foreign currency interest rate swap contracts  to hedge foreign currency and interest rate exposure on specific funding agreement liabilities 
finally  from time to time the company has entered into other swap contracts for investment purposes 
the company recognized million and million of net realized losses on derivatives for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the realized losses during the year ended december   were primarily due to the termination of derivative instruments used to hedge funding agreements  during a declining interest rate environment  in response to short term funding agreement withdrawals and the retirement of certain long term funding agreements at discounts 
the realized losses during the year ended december  were due primarily to the termination of swap contracts used to hedge short term funding agreements  during a declining interest rate environment  in response to withdrawals 
the company manages the risk of cash flow variability on floating rate funding agreements that are matched with fixed rate securities  by hedging with interest rate swap contracts designed to pay fixed and receive floating interest 
with the adoption of statement no 
on january   the swap contracts were considered cash flow hedges of the interest rate risk associated with the floating rate funding agreements  including funding agreements with put features allowing the policyholder to cancel the contract prior to maturity 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reviewed the trend in put activity since inception of the funding agreement business in order to determine the ongoing effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
based upon the historical trend in put activity  as well as management s uncertainty about possible future events  the company had determined that it was probable that some of the future variable cash flows of the puttable funding agreements would not occur  and therefore the hedges were ineffective 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reclassified losses of million to gains losses on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of income from other comprehensive income related to the payments that were probable of not occurring on ineffective interest rate swap contracts 
during  the company reclassified these losses of million to realized investment losses from gains losses on derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of income upon termination of the ineffective interest rate swap contracts 
as of december   the company no longer has outstanding floating rate funding agreements with put features 
in addition  the company no longer offers long term or short term funding agreements 
market risk and risk management policies interest rate sensitivity the operations of the company are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are paid  withdrawn  mature or re price in specified periods 
the principal objective of the company s asset liability management activities is to provide maximum levels of net investment income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and facilitating the funding needs of the company 
the company has developed an asset liability management approach tailored to specific insurance or investment product objectives 
the investment assets of the company are managed in over portfolio segments consistent with specific products or groups of products having similar liability characteristics 
as part of this approach  management develops investment guidelines for each portfolio consistent with the return objectives  risk tolerance  liquidity  time horizon  tax and regulatory requirements of the related product or business segment 
management has a general policy of diversifying investments both within and across all portfolios 
the company monitors the credit quality of its investments and its exposure to individual markets  borrowers  industries  sectors  and in the case of mortgages  property types and geographic locations 
in addition  the company carries long and short term debt  as well as mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the company 
the company uses derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  with indices that correlate to balance sheet instruments to modify its indicated net interest sensitivity to levels deemed to be appropriate 
specifically  for floating rate gic liabilities that are matched with fixed rate securities  the company manages the interest rate risk by hedging with interest rate swap contracts designed to pay fixed and receive floating interest 
additionally  the company uses exchange traded financial futures contracts to hedge against interest rate risk on the reinvestment of fixed maturities 
prior to september  the company used exchange traded financial futures contracts to hedge against interest rate risk on anticipated gic sales and other funding agreements 
the company no longer offers funding agreements see description of operating segments 
the following tables for the years ended december  and provide information about the company s financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturities  unless otherwise noted below 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties  or the company may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers 
mortgage backed and asset backed securities are included in the category representing their expected maturity 
available for sale securities include both us and foreign denominated fixed maturities  but exclude interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency swap contracts  which are disclosed in separate tables 
foreign denominated fixed maturities are also shown separately in the table of financial instruments subject to foreign currency risk 
variable interest rate gic liabilities are included in the category representing their contractual maturity  regardless of whether the liability includes a put feature 
for liabilities that have no contractual maturity  the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates based on the company s historical experience  management s judgment  and statistical analysis  as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
additionally  the company has assumed its available for sale securities are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes 
specifically  variable rate available for sale securities and mortgage loans comprise an immaterial portion of the portfolio and do not have a significant impact on weighted average interest rates 
therefore  the variable rate investments are not presented separately  instead they are included in the tables at their current interest rate

sale of universal life insurance business historically  afs offered fixed universal life insurance products through its agency distribution channel see allmerica financial services statutory premiums and deposits for a description of its former distribution channels 
the company sold substantially all of this business through a coinsurance agreement which was effective december  under the agreement  the company ceded approximately million of universal life insurance reserves in exchange for the transfer of approximately million of investment assets with an amortized cost of approximately million 
at december   the company recorded a loss from this transaction of million  net of taxes 
this loss consisted primarily of the aforementioned ceded reserves  asset transfers  a permanent impairment of the universal life deferred acquisition cost asset of million and administrative expenses of approximately million 
on a statutory accounting basis  this transaction produced an increase in statutory surplus of approximately million see statutory capital of insurance subsidiaries 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following critical accounting policies  among others  are those which management believes affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
additional information about the company s significant accounting policies may be found in note  summary of significant accounting policies on pages to of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
property casualty insurance loss reserves the amount of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves the loss reserves  as discussed in segment results risk management  reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses is determined based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process is judgmental  and requires the company to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims on type of business and nature of claim bases 
using data obtained from this monitoring and assumptions about emerging trends  the company develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions  which vary by line of business  used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
because the amount of the loss reserves is sensitive to the company s assumptions  the company does not completely rely on only one estimate to determine its loss reserves 
rather  the company develops several estimates using generally recognized actuarial projection methodologies that result in a range of reasonably possible loss reserve outcomes  the company s best estimate is within that range 
when trends emerge that the company believes affect the future settlement of claims  the company will adjust its reserves accordingly 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as adjustments to losses and loss adjustment expenses 
often  these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are disclosed and discussed separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to the financial results of the company 
property casualty reinsurance recoverables the company shares a significant amount of insurance risk of the primary underlying contracts with various insurance entities through the use of reinsurance contracts see segment results risk management  reinsurance 
as a result  when the company experiences loss events that are subject to the reinsurance contract  reinsurance recoveries are recorded 
the amount of the reinsurance recoverable can vary based on the size of the individual loss or the aggregate amount of all losses in a particular line  book of business or an aggregate amount associated with a particular accident year 
the valuation of losses recoverable depends on whether the underlying loss is a reported loss  or an incurred but not reported loss 
for reported losses  the company values reinsurance recoverables at the time the underlying loss is recognized  in accordance with contract terms 
for incurred but not reported losses  the company estimates the amount of reinsurance recoverable based on the terms of the reinsurance contracts and historical reinsurance recovery information and applies that information to the gross loss reserve estimates 
the most significant assumption the company uses is the average size of the individual losses for those claims that have occurred but have not yet been recorded by the company 
the reinsurance recoverable is based on what the company believes are reasonable estimates and is disclosed separately on the financial statements 
however  the ultimate amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
variable products deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs consist of commissions  underwriting costs and other costs  which vary with  and are primarily related to  the production of insurance deposits 
acquisition costs related to the company s variable products variable universal life and variable annuities are recorded on the balance sheet and amortized through the income statement in proportion to total estimated gross profits over the expected life of the contracts see segment results allmerica financial services  deferred acquisition costs 
the company s estimated gross profits are based on assumptions including mortality  persistency  asset growth rates and expenses associated with policy maintenance 
the principal source of earnings for these policies is from asset based fees  which can vary in relation to changes in the equity market 
at each balance sheet date  the company evaluates the historical and expected future gross profits 
any adjustment in estimated profit requires that the amortization rate be revised retroactively to the date of policy annuity issuance 
the cumulative difference related to prior periods is recognized as a component of the current periods amortization  along with amortization associated with the actual gross profits of the period 
lower actual gross profits would typically result in less amortization expense 
the converse would also be true 
however  if lower gross profits were to continue into the future  a partial permanent impairment of the existing dac asset may occur 
the company periodically reviews the dac asset to determine if it is recoverable from future income 
if dac is determined to be unrecoverable  such costs are expensed at the time of determination 
the amount of dac considered recoverable would be reduced in the near term if the estimate of ultimate or future gross profits is reduced 
the amount of dac amortization would be revised if any of the estimates discussed above are revised 
in addition  the disposition of a line of business can result in the permanent impairment of the related dac asset 
other than temporary impairments the company employs a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair values below amortized cost for all investments 
this methodology ensures that available evidence concerning the declines is evaluated in a disciplined manner 
in determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost is other than temporary  the company evaluates the length of time typically six months or longer and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  the issuer s financial performance  including earnings trends  dividend payments  and asset quality  any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer  general market conditions  and  the financial condition and prospects of the issuer s market and industry 
the company applies judgment in assessing whether the aforementioned factors have caused an other than temporary decline in value 
when an other than temporary decline in value is deemed to have occurred  the company reduces the cost basis of the investment to fair value 
this reduction is permanent and is recognized as a realized investment loss see investment portfolio 
statutory capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic prescribes an annual calculation regarding risk based capital rbc 
rbc is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile 
the rbc ratio for regulatory purposes is calculated as total adjusted capital divided by required risk based capital 
total adjusted capital for life insurance companies is defined as capital and surplus  plus asset valuation reserve  plus of dividends apportioned for payment 
total adjusted capital for property and casualty companies is capital and surplus 
the company action level is the first level at which regulatory involvement is specified based upon the level of capital 
regulators may take action for reasons other than triggering various rbc action levels 
the various action levels are summarized as follows 
the company action level  which equals of the authorized control level  requires the company to prepare and submit a rbc plan to the commissioner of the state of domicile 
a rbc plan proposes actions which a company may take in order to bring statutory capital above the company action level 
after review  the commissioner will notify the company if the plan is satisfactory 

the regulatory action level  which equals of the authorized control level  requires the insurer to submit to the commissioner of the state of domicile a rbc plan  or if applicable  a revised rbc plan 
after examination or analysis  the commissioner will issue an order specifying corrective actions corrective order to be taken 

the authorized control level authorizes the commissioner of the state of domicile to take whatever regulatory actions considered necessary to protect the best interest of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer 

the mandatory control level  which equals of the authorized control level  authorizes the commissioner of the state of domicile to take actions necessary to place the company under regulatory control ie rehabilitation or liquidation 

life and health companies whose total adjusted capital is between and of the authorized control level are subject to a trend test 
the trend test calculates the greater of the decrease in the margin between the current year and the prior year and the average of the past three years 
it assumes that the decrease could occur again in the coming year 
any company that trends below of the authorized control level ie demonstrates a negative trend would trigger the company action level 
as of december   both afliac and faflic had adjusted capital levels well above of the authorized control level risk based capital and  therefore  were not subject to the trend test 
rbc ratios for regulatory purposes  as described above  are expressed as a percentage of the capital required to be above the authorized control level the regulatory scale  however  in the insurance industry rbc ratios are widely expressed as a percentage of the company action level without regard to the application of the negative trend test 
set forth below are rbc ratios for the companies life insurance subsidiaries and for hanover as of december   expressed both on the industry scale total adjusted capital divided by the company action level and regulatory scale total adjusted capital divided by authorized control level in millions  except ratios total company authorized rbc ratio rbc ratio adjusted action control industry regulatory capital level level scale scale afliac faflic hanover afliac s total adjusted capital includes million related to its subsidiary  faflic 
hanover s total adjusted capital includes million related to its subsidiary  citizens 
on december   afliac  previously a delaware domiciled life insurance company  became a massachusetts domiciled life insurance company 
on december   afliac became a direct subsidiary of afc  as well as the immediate parent of faflic 
under the previous internal ownership structure  faflic was the immediate parent of afliac and a direct subsidiary of afc 
as a result of this internal reorganization  the statutory surplus of afliac substantially increased since it includes faflic s capital 
this allows for a greater tolerance of equity market volatility 
in turn  the statutory surplus of faflic substantially decreased since it no longer includes afliac s capital 
however  faflic s statutory surplus is no longer as susceptible to equity market volatility since afliac  which holds approximately of the company s annuity products that are most sensitive to changes in the equity market  is no longer consolidated into faflic 
afc has entered into an agreement with the massachusetts commissioner of insurance  the massachusetts commissioner  in consideration of the decision not to write new business  whereby it will indefinitely maintain the rbc ratio of afliac at a minimum of of the company action level on the industry scale 
this agreement  which was previously with faflic  replaced an earlier commitment that faflic maintain a rbc ratio on the industry scale 
afc has also entered into several transactions that significantly improved the statutory capital positions of both afliac and faflic as of december  these transactions include selling  through a coinsurance agreement  effective december   the fixed universal life insurance block of business which produced an increase in statutory surplus of approximately million 
in addition  faflic successfully completed a tender offer through which it retired additional long term funding agreements at amounts less than statutory accounting carrying values 
this transaction  together with open market repurchases of long term funding agreements in the fourth quarter  resulted in the retirement of approximately million of funding agreements at amounts below face value 
these actions produced a net increase in faflic s statutory surplus of approximately million 
during  afc made capital contributions to its then subsidiary faflic  which in turn contributed capital to its then subsidiary  afliac 
such contributions were necessary due to the negative impact on statutory surplus of increased sales commissions  the effect of declines in the equity market on gmdb reserves and an increased level of realized investment losses 
such contributions were also made in consideration of the ratings of the life companies and the rbc agreement described above  which has since been superseded 
for each contribution made  the amount was accrued as of the end of the prior quarter and was  therefore  reflected in the previous quarter s surplus balance in the corresponding company s statutory quarterly or annual statement 
hanover also paid an ordinary dividend to afc in july  contributions pertaining to were as follows date of path of amount effective contribution contribution in millions date february  afc to faflic december  faflic to afliac may  afc to faflic march  faflic to afliac july  hanover to afc july  august  afc to faflic june  faflic to afliac october  faflic to afliac september  january  afc to faflic december  faflic to afliac the effective date represents the date which these transactions were reflected in the company s statutory surplus balance 
the company does not expect the life insurance subsidiaries to require levels of capital contributions from afc as in prior years  due to the expectation of sufficient statutory capital and earnings  therefore  the company does not expect that it will be necessary to dividend significant funds from its property and casualty companies to afc during see liquidity and capital resources 
the statutory surplus of the life companies  particularly afliac  which holds approximately of the annuity deposits with the gmdb feature  is highly sensitive to movements in the equity market 
this is due  in large part  to the required methodology for calculating gmdb actuarial guideline reserves for statutory accounting purposes 
as of december   the level of net gmdb reserves in the life companies was approximately million 
an increase of these reserves does not result directly in cash losses to the company  but it does result in a reduction in statutory surplus 
for each one percent decline in the s p index  the expected increase in required statutory gmdb reserves is approximately million to million 
any increase in required reserves would result in an equal decrease in the statutory surplus 
any increase in the s p index would result in a decrease in required statutory gmdb reserves  as well as an increase in surplus due to the impact of the gmdb reinsurance 
the dac amortization adjustments described earlier do not have an impact on statutory surplus  as dac is not a concept recognized under statutory accounting principles 
afliac entered into a reinsurance agreement  in  with an independent reinsurer  to cede up to million of its gmdb costs annually based upon contract date  in excess of million  for a three year period 
as described under liquidity and capital resources below  afc entered into a related agreement to reimburse costs incurred by this independent reinsurer 
the above mentioned agreement was superseded by the implementation of a new gmdb mortality reinsurance program 
effective december   afliac and faflic entered into a new mortality reinsurance program with unaffiliated reinsurers covering the incidence of mortality on variable annuity policies 
this transaction reduced required statutory net gmdb reserves and resulted in an increase in statutory capital and surplus of approximately million for the life companies at december  for the year ended december   afliac and faflic incurred gmdb costs of million and million  respectively  and ceded million and million  respectively  of gmdb costs under the aforementioned reinsurance programs 
the actuarial profession is currently examining issues surrounding the development of a reserve methodology for variable annuity products 
although no specific recommendations have been made at this time  such changes could potentially have a material negative effect on the company s statutory surplus and rbc ratio 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations 
as a holding company  afc s primary source of cash is dividends from its insurance subsidiaries 
however  dividend payments to afc by its insurance subsidiaries are subject to limitations imposed by state regulators  such as the requirement that cash dividends be paid out of unreserved and unrestricted earned surplus and restrictions on the payment of extraordinary dividends  as defined 
as mentioned above see statutory capital of insurance subsidiaries  afc has entered into an agreement with the massachusetts insurance commissioner  in consideration of the decision not to write new life insurance and annuity business  whereby it partially offset by cash provided by sales of mortgage loans  and year over year declines in purchases of mortgages and will indefinitely maintain the rbc ratio of afliac at a minimum of of the company action level on the industry scale 
during  afc received million of dividends from its property and casualty businesses 
additional dividends from the company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries prior to july  would be considered extraordinary and would require prior approval from the respective state regulators 
the company does not expect dividend payments from its life insurance subsidiaries in during  afc contributed million to its life insurance subsidiaries 
such capital contributions were made due to the negative impact on statutory surplus of increased sales commissions  gmdb reserves  an increased level of realized investment losses  the level of premiums and deposits and in consideration of the ratings of the life companies and the rbc agreement  as described above  which has since been superseded 
the company does not expect that its life insurance subsidiaries will require the levels of capital contributions as in prior years due to the expectation of sufficient statutory capital and earnings  therefore  the company does not expect it will be necessary to dividend funds from the property and casualty companies in however  there can be no guarantee that future dividends will not be necessary in order to maintain these surplus levels 
in  afliac entered into an agreement to cede a portion of its gmdb obligations to an independent reinsurer see statutory capital of insurance subsidiaries 
under a related agreement  afc agreed to reimburse these costs to the reinsurer 
in  afliac incurred gmdb costs of approximately million 
since  afliac ceded million under the agreement  of which afc has reimbursed million through december management expects that reimbursements related to this agreement will not be significant in the future due to the aforementioned additional gmdb reinsurance program 
sources of cash for the company s insurance subsidiaries are from premiums and fees collected  investment income and maturing investments 
primary cash outflows are paid benefits  claims  losses and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition expenses  other underwriting expenses and investment purchases 
cash outflows related to benefits  claims  losses and loss adjustment expenses can be variable because of uncertainties surrounding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses either individually or in the aggregate 
management expects that  due to the decision to cease new sales of life and annuity products  the expectation of high policy surrenders in afs products and the retirement of funding obligations in aam  additional cash outflows will occur in these outflows will be funded with existing cash and with proceeds from sales of cash equivalents and fixed maturities 
the company periodically adjusts its investment policy to respond to changes in short term and long term cash requirements 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash during primarily reflects net payments from the general account as a result of increased annuity contract withdrawals in the afs segment as a result of ratings downgrades and the company s decision to cease new sales  compared to net deposits in which included funds received from the aforementioned promotional annuity program 
additionally  premium collections in the property and casualty business decreased as compared to  principally due to timing of cash receipts 
the company also made approximately million of payments related to funds held for the aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contract as a result of the ratings downgrades see rating agency actions 
these net cash outflows were partially offset by decreased loss and lae payments in the property and casualty business  as well as increased federal income tax refunds 
the increase in is primarily the result of higher general account deposits  including funds received from the aforementioned promotional annuity program with enhanced crediting rates and to an increase in premiums received from the property and casualty business 
these increases in cash were partially offset by increased loss and lae payments in the property and casualty business 
net cash provided by investing activities was billion in  while net cash used in investing activities was billion and million in and  respectively 
the billion increase in cash provided in from resulted primarily from net sales of fixed maturities in  compared to net purchases of fixed maturities in the increase in net sales of fixed maturities in was primarily a result of short term funding agreement withdrawals  the retirement of certain long term funding agreements  and payments made related to annuity surrenders in the afs segment 
the million increase in cash used in is primarily the result of higher net purchases of fixed maturities  partially offset by cash provided by sales of mortgage loans  and year over year declines in purchases of mortgages and company owned life insurance 
net purchases of fixed maturities in increased principally due to additional deposits into the general account  including those related to the aforementioned promotional annuity program 
net cash used in financing activities was billion in  while net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to net funding agreement withdrawals  including the retirement of the trust instruments supported by funding obligations  of billion versus net deposits of million in and to the re payment of the company s short term debt obligation of million in the decrease in cash provided in compared to is primarily due to lower net funding agreement deposits  including trust instruments supported by funding obligations  partially offset by the absence of common stock repurchases in at december   afc  as a holding company  held million of cash and investments 
historically  funds provided to the holding company were from its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries 
management believes the holding company of afc has the ability to meet its obligations through  including annual interest on senior debentures and capital securities of million and the million capital contribution paid in january to its life insurance subsidiaries see statutory capital of insurance subsidiaries 
therefore  the company currently does not expect it will be necessary to dividend funds from the property and casualty companies in in order to fund holding company obligations as discussed above 
however  the company believes the holding company will require additional funding in in order to meet its obligations  which will include obligations consistent with those expected for and may include certain federal income tax liabilities 
the company decided  in  to suspend payment of its annual common stock dividend 
whether the company will pay dividends in the future depends upon the earnings and financial condition of afc  although the company does not expect to pay a dividend in the company expects to continue to generate sufficient positive cash to meet all short term and long term cash requirements 
the company s insurance subsidiaries maintain a high degree of liquidity within their respective investment portfolios in fixed maturity investments  common stock and short term investments 
afc has million available under a committed syndicated credit agreement which expires may borrowings under this agreement are unsecured and incur interest at a rate per annum equal to  at the company s option  a designated base rate or the eurodollar rate plus applicable margin 
the agreement provides covenants  including  but not limited to  requirements that the company maintain adjusted statutory surplus in certain of its insurance subsidiaries totaling in excess of billion 
at december   the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under this agreement 
in addition  the company had no commercial paper borrowing as of december  ratings downgrades have adversely affected the cost and availability of additional debt and equity financing and will continue to do so in the future should ratings remain at current levels or decrease further see rating agency actions 
the company does not expect to renew this credit agreement 
the company s financing obligations generally include debt  minority interest on and repayment of the company s capital securities  operating lease payments  trust instruments supported by funding obligations and funding agreements

contingencies the company s insurance subsidiaries are routinely engaged in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business  including claims for extracontractual or punitive damages 
additional information on other litigation and claims may be found in note  contingencies litigation  on pages and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in financial statements and supplementary data of this form k 
in the opinion of management  none of such contingencies are expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  although it is possible that the results of operations in a particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome 
rating agency actions insurance companies are rated by rating agencies to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers information on specific insurance companies 
higher ratings generally indicate the rating agencies opinion regarding financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims 
management believes that strong ratings are important factors in marketing the company s products to its agents and customers  since rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
insurance company financial strength ratings are assigned to an insurer based upon factors deemed by the rating agencies to be relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors 
such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy  hold or sell any security

in addition  the company is no longer able to sell its gic products 
these downgrades have also caused counterparties to terminate certain swap agreements  which have been replaced with alternative derivative instruments 
the decrease in the property and casualty ratings  in particular the am best rating  could continue to negatively impact earnings and growth in this business  primarily in the company s commercial lines 
in the fourth quarter  the company secured third party guarantees  which expire in august  in an effort to minimize the loss of commercial lines business as a result of the downgrades 
these measures are primarily intended to reduce the risk of cancellation or non renewal of these commercial policies in the near term 
the company believes that the longer the ratings remain at the current level  the greater the adverse effect of the lower ratings on the operating results of the risk management segment 
there can be no assurance that these downgrades  or any further downgrades that may occur  will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial position of the company 
rating downgrades have also adversely affected the cost and availability of any additional debt or equity financing and will continue to do so in the future should ratings remain at current levels or decrease further 
recent developments the company recognized net periodic pension expenses from its employee pension plans of million and million in and  respectively 
in  the company recognized a net periodic pension benefit of million related to these plans 
the expense or benefit related to the pension plans results from several factors  including changes in the market value of plan assets  interest rates and employee compensation levels 
the net expense in and primarily reflects decreased market values of plan assets as compared to prior years  while the net benefit in primarily reflects increases in the market value of plan assets 
in addition  during  the company recognized million of additional pension expenses associated with the restructuring of the afs segment
