critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables  impaired finance receivables  assets received to satisfy receivables and residual values on direct financing leases 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables is estimated by management based on total finance receivables  charge offs  non accrual delinquent finance receivables and management s current assessment of the risks inherent in the company s finance receivables from national and regional economic conditions  industry conditions  concentrations  the financial condition of counterparties includes the obligor lessee and other parties the company may have recourse to such as equipment vendors manufacturers and owners affiliates of the obligor lessee  equipment collateral values and other factors 
changes in the allowance level may be necessary based on unexpected changes in these factors 
impaired finance receivables are recorded at their current estimated net realizable value if less than their carrying amount 
assets received to satisfy receivables are recorded at their current estimated fair value less selling costs if less than their carrying amount 
management estimates these amounts based on expected cash flows and the prevailing market value and condition of the collateral 
adverse changes in the expected cash flows and market value and condition of the collateral would cause the company to incur additional write downs 
the company records residual values on its direct financing leases at the lowest of i any stated purchase option  ii the present value at the end of the initial lease term of rentals due under any renewal options or iii the estimated fair value of the equipment at the end of the lease 
the company may not be able to realize the full amount of the estimated residual value recorded due to subsequent adverse changes in equipment values which would cause the company to incur a write down 
results of operations comparison of fiscal to fiscal net earnings decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal excluding the million loss on the redemption of the company s convertible debt in fiscal million after tax  net earnings decreased by to million in fiscal the decrease was due to i a higher provision for losses on finance receivables  increased costs and reduced finance income resulting from a higher level of non performing assets  ii the effects of continued low market interest rates and  to a lesser extent  iii increased costs of being a public company 
these factors were partially offset by i the increase in average finance receivables outstanding  ii reduced interest expense from the conversion of million of debt into equity and  to a lesser extent  iii lower salary expense 
finance income decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease resulted from the lower net yield of finance receivables from continued low market interest rates and  to a lesser extent  increased non accrual finance receivables 
these factors were partially offset by the million increase in average finance receivables outstanding to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal interest expense  incurred on borrowing used to fund finance receivables  decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease resulted from lower average market interest rates and the august debt conversion redemption 
these factors were partially offset by the million increase in average debt outstanding excluding the conversion of million of debt into equity 
net finance income before provision for credit losses on finance receivables decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net finance income before provision for credit losses expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables outstanding net interest margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease resulted from the effects of continued low market interest rates and the increase in non accrual finance receivables 
these factors were partially offset by the effect of the decrease in the company s leverage 
the provision for credit losses on finance receivables increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to increased net charge offs write downs of finance receivables less recoveries 
the increase in net charge offs resulted from higher amounts of non performing assets  declining equipment values  a weak resale market and general economic conditions 
salaries and other expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from increased costs associated with higher amounts of non performing assets and  to a lesser extent  increased costs of being a public company includes internal and external audit costs  legal fees and insurance 
these factors were partially offset by decreased salary expense due to the effect of work force reductions exceeding salary increases 
salaries and other expenses expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables outstanding expense ratio increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase resulted from the increase in expenses  partially offset by the increase in average finance receivables outstanding 
the provision for income taxes decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal resulting from the decrease in earnings before income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal and diluted earnings per share decreased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal  and basic earnings per share decreased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal the percentage decrease in diluted earnings per share was lower than the percentage decrease in net earnings primarily due to the decrease in the number of dilutive shares outstanding from the august redemption of convertible debt 
the percentage decrease in basic earnings per share was higher than the percentage decrease in net earnings primarily due to the issuance of million shares of common stock from the august conversion of million of debt 
diluted and basic earnings per share for fiscal  excluding the after tax loss on redemption of convertible debt  were and  respectively 
net earnings and diluted and basic earnings per share excluding the million after tax loss on the redemption of convertible debt are non gaap financial measures 
management believes these amounts to be useful to investors in comparing the company s current operating performance to past and future fiscal periods 
the excluded loss resulted from the company s redemption of its convertible subordinated notes 
the notes were redeemed to eliminate their dilutive effect 
this was a non recurring event 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net earnings increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to lower market interest rates and growth in finance receivables  partially offset by the effects of higher net charge offs and higher non performing assets 
finance income increased by less than to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the million increase in average finance receivables outstanding to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal offset by i the decrease in the net yield of finance receivables as a result of the decline in market interest rates since january and  to a lesser extent  ii an increase in the level of non performing assets in fiscal finance receivables originated in fiscal and in fiscal were million and million  respectively 
interest expense decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to significantly lower average market interest rates in fiscal  partially offset by the million increase in average debt outstanding in fiscal from fiscal net finance income before provision for credit losses on finance receivables increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net interest margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the decline in market interest rates from january and  to a lesser extent  the decrease in the company s leverage to at july  from at july  the provision for credit losses on finance receivables increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to the increase in net charge offs and the growth in finance receivables in fiscal salaries and other expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of marketing and administrative employees  salary increases and increased costs associated with higher non performing assets 
the expense ratio increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase resulted from the increase in expenses  partially offset by the increase in average finance receivables outstanding 
the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to the increase in earnings before income taxes and  to a lesser extent  the increase in the company s effective tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal diluted earnings per share increased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal  and basic earnings per share increased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal the percentage increase in diluted earnings per share was lower than the percentage increase in net earnings primarily due to the effect that the convertible notes have on the diluted earnings per share calculation and the increase in the average price of the company s common stock in fiscal the percentage increase in basic earnings per share was lower than the percentage increase in net earnings primarily due to the increase in the number of outstanding shares of the company s common stock resulting from the exercise of the company s million warrants in the second quarter of fiscal receivable portfolio and asset quality finance receivables outstanding decreased by million to billion at july  from billion at july  finance receivables comprise installment sale agreements and secured loans collectively referred to as loans and investments in direct financing leases 
at july   loans were billion of finance receivables  and leases were million of finance receivables 
finance receivables originated in fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
finance receivables collected in fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
originations decreased due to general economic conditions 
the company s underwriting policies and procedures require obtaining a first lien on equipment financed or ownership of equipment leased 
the equipment financed leased by the company generally possesses certain characteristics that can mitigate losses 
the equipment collateral typically has an economic life exceeding the term of the transaction  historically low levels of technological obsolescence  use in multiple industries  ease of access and transporting  and a broad  established resale market 
the company does not finance lease aircraft and railcars  computer related equipment  fixtures and telecommunications equipment or equipment not located in the united states 
the company has an allowance for credit losses on finance receivables on its balance sheet 
the purpose of the allowance is to provide for any inherent losses at the balance sheet date 
the allowance for credit losses was million at july  and million at july  the allowance level was of finance receivables at july  and at july  management periodically reviews the allowance to determine that its level is appropriate 
net charge offs of finance receivables write downs less recoveries increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net charge offs  expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables outstanding loss ratio  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal write downs are recorded on impaired finance receivables when all amounts contractually due are not expected to be collected from the combination of the obligor lessee  any guarantor and the liquidation of the underlying collateral 
net charge offs increased primarily due to a higher level of non performing assets  declining equipment values  a weak resale market and general economic conditions 
effective august   the company accelerated the non accrual classification of finance receivables 
finance receivables with a contractual payment days or more past due are classified as non accrual  the prior threshold was days 
this change did not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in addition  the company has reclassified assets received to satisfy finance receivables repossessed equipment from finance receivables to other assets 
the company made these changes to conform to industry practice 
non accrual finance receivables and repossessed equipment are presented below in millions july  non accrual finance receivables repossessed equipment total non performing assets percentage of total finance receivables includes million of total receivables at july  arising from the acceleration of the non accrual classification of finance receivables from to days 
delinquent finance receivables transactions with a contractual payment or more days past due were million of total finance receivables at july  compared to million of total finance receivables at july  approximately half of the company s non accrual finance receivables at july  were not delinquent 
the company s asset quality statistics in fiscal  although having improved in the fourth quarter  continued to reflect weak economic and industry conditions and the effects of the war 
these factors caused more customers to pay late  stop paying  declare bankruptcy or liquidate their businesses and also caused declines in equipment values 
a continuation of these conditions could result in higher net charge offs and non performing assets 
increases in net charge offs would have a negative effect on earnings through additional increases in the provision for credit losses and increases in non performing assets would have a negative effect on earnings by reducing finance income and increasing charge offs 
although net charge offs have been increasing and may continue to increase  the current and expected levels are within current and historical industry experience 
finance receivables reflect certain industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk 
these concentrations arise from counterparties having similar economic characteristics that could cause their ability to meet their contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
at july   the major industry concentrations are construction related  road transportation  waste services and manufacturing 
the regional geographic concentrations are southeast  northeast  southwest  west and central 
the company limits its exposure with any single customer 
at july   this limit was million 
the company s largest and ten largest customer s accounted for million and million  respectively  of total finance receivables at july  liquidity and capital resources the company s operations and growth depend upon the continued availability of funds to originate or acquire finance receivables  to purchase portfolios of finance receivables and to repay maturing debt 
the company may obtain funds from many sources  including operating cash flow  private and public issuances of term debt  conduit and term securitizations of finance receivables  borrowings under committed unsecured revolving credit facilities  dealer placed and directly issued commercial paper and sales of common and preferred equity 
management believes that the company s sources of liquidity are well diversified 
the company is not dependent on any single funding source or on any single credit provider 
management believes  but cannot assure  that sufficient liquidity is available to the company to support its future operations and growth 
the senior term notes of the company s major operating subsidiary are rated bbb by fitch  inc fitch  a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization and the subsidiary s commercial paper is rated f by fitch 
all of the company s senior term notes and a majority of the company s commercial paper were issued by the subsidiary 
the company s access to capital markets at competitive rates is partly dependent on these investment grade credit ratings 
fitch recently reaffirmed its ratings of the subsidiary with a positive outlook 
the debt agreements of the subsidiary contain certain restrictive covenants including limitations on indebtedness  encumbrances  investments  dividends and other distributions to the company  sales of assets  mergers and other business combinations  capital expenditures  interest coverage and net worth 
none of the debt agreements contain a material adverse change clause 
based on the minimum net worth requirements of these agreements  the amount of equity that the company could distribute was indirectly limited to million at july  total debt decreased by million to billion at july  from billion at july  and stockholders equity increased by million to million at july  from million at july  as a result  leverage debt to equity ratio decreased to at july  from at july  the decrease in debt and the increase in equity resulted from the conversion of million of debt into equity in august and net earnings of million in fiscal debt comprised the following in millions july  july  amount percent amount percent senior term notes asset securitization financings commercial paper borrowings under bank credit facilities subordinated debt total principal amount   fair value adjustment of hedged debt total debt   the company has decreased its short term unsecured debt since fiscal short term unsecured debt has decreased from of total debt at july  to at july  senior term notes in april  the company issued million of unsecured senior term notes to thirteen insurance companies 
the company received million in april and million in june to match maturing debt 
the company used the proceeds to repay borrowings under bank credit facilities  commercial paper and maturing term debt 
the notes include million of fixed rate notes and million of floating rate notes due at maturity as follows million in april and june and million in april and june in august  the company received the remaining million of its july issuance of million of fixed and floating rate unsecured senior term notes and used the proceeds to repay borrowings under bank credit facilities and commercial paper 
in fiscal  the company repaid million of unsecured senior term notes at maturity with proceeds from borrowings under bank credit facilities and new term debt 
the company also prepaid a million unsecured senior term note at principal with proceeds from borrowings under bank credit facilities 
at july   the million of senior term notes outstanding comprised million of private placements and medium term notes with insurance companies and million of bank term loans 
the weighted average maturity of the notes is years compared to years at july  and the notes are due as follows in millions fiscal asset securitization financings in august  the company borrowed million in the third transaction under its asset securitization facility that was established in july the company used the proceeds to repay borrowings under bank credit facilities and commercial paper 
the company structured the terms of the facility so that any securitization proceeds are classified as debt and not as sales of receivables for financial reporting purposes 
therefore  the company has not recorded any gains on sales of securitized receivables 
at july   the company had million of asset securitization financings accounted for as secured borrowings included in senior debt on its consolidated balance sheet 
borrowings under the securitization facility are limited to a minimum level of securitized receivables 
when borrowings exceed the minimum level  the company can repay the excess or securitize more receivables 
the company can securitize more receivables during the term of the facility 
the facility expires march  the company currently intends to renew the facility for another year 
upon the expiration of the facility  the company can repay borrowings outstanding or convert them into term debt 
the term debt would be repaid in monthly amounts equal to the collections of securitized receivables 
currently  the company would exercise the conversion option if the facility was not renewed 
based on the contractual payments of the million of securitized receivables at july   the term debt would be fully repaid by july the unsecured senior debt agreements of the company s major operating subsidiary limit the amount of finance receivables that the subsidiary can securitize to of its finance receivables outstanding  approximately million at july  therefore  the company could securitize an additional million of finance receivables at july  the amount that the company can borrow under the securitization facility is limited to of securitized receivables 
commercial paper the company issues commercial paper directly and through a million program 
the company s commercial paper is unsecured and matures within days 
the company has not obtained commitments from any purchaser of its commercial paper for additional or future purchases 
increases in commercial paper are generally offset by decreases in bank and other borrowings  and vice versa 
commercial paper outstanding at july  was million  a decrease of million from the million outstanding at july  the company s current policy is to maintain committed revolving credit facilities from banks so that the aggregate amount available thereunder exceeds commercial paper outstanding 
bank credit facilities at july   the company had million of committed unsecured revolving credit facilities from ten banks a million decrease from july  
this includes million of facilities with original terms ranging from two to five years and million of facilities with an original term of one year 
at july   million was outstanding  with a maturity of seven days  under a multi year facility 
these facilities range from million to million 
the multi year facilities expire as follows in millions fiscal during fiscal  the company obtained million of additional credit facilities from a bank and renewed million of credit facilities with four banks 
also  million of credit facilities from six banks expired in fiscal at july   the company had a commitment to obtain two new credit facilities from a bank totaling million 
these facilities provide the company with a dependable  low cost source of funds and support for its commercial paper program 
the company can borrow the full amount under each facility 
none of the facilities are for commercial paper back up only 
these facilities may or may not be renewed upon expiration 
information on the combined amounts of commercial paper and bank borrowings follows in millions fiscal maximum outstanding during the year average outstanding during the year outstanding at year end convertible notes in july  the company called its convertible subordinated notes due in may for redemption 
the redemption was completed in august  million of the notes were redeemed for cash and million of the notes were converted into million shares of the company s common stock at the stated conversion price of per share 
the company called the notes because they were an expensive form of financing considering their dilution and their cost relative to current market interest rates 
the company also had sufficient resources to call the notes from the july million debt issuance and the august million asset securitization financing 
the company paid a million prepayment premium equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed for cash 
stockholders equity in fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of common stock for million through its repurchase program 
at july   million was available under the program for future repurchases 
market interest rate risk and sensitivity the company s earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in market interest rates includes libor  rates on us treasury securities  money market rates and the prime rate 
changes in these rates affect the company s finance income and interest expense 
generally  based on the current mix of fixed rate and floating rate finance receivables and debt  increases in rates would have a negative impact on earnings  and decreases in rates would have a positive impact on earnings because the company has more floating rate and short term debt than fixed rate term debt  and more fixed rate finance receivables than floating rate finance receivables 
as a result  if market interest rates rise  the company s borrowing costs would increase faster than the yield on its finance receivables 
conversely  if market interest rates decline  the company s borrowing costs would decrease faster than the yield on its finance receivables 
these effects would diminish over time 
in addition  since the company s interest earning assets exceed its interest bearing liabilities  eventually  lower market interest rates would reduce net earnings and higher rates would increase net earnings 
these broad statements do not take into account the effects of economic and other conditions that could accompany interest rate fluctuations 
the net yield of finance receivables less the weighted average cost of borrowed funds represents the net interest spread  an important measure of a finance company s profitability 
the net interest spread for fiscal  and follow years ended july  net yield of finance receivables weighted average cost of borrowed funds net interest spread the effect of continued low market interest rates started to reduce the company s net interest spread in the second quarter of fiscal the company expects the net interest spread to continue to decline because the net yield of finance receivables will decline as new finance receivables are booked at rates that are lower than the rates on finance receivables collected more than the company s cost of funds 
the company monitors and manages its exposure to market interest rate fluctuations through risk management procedures that include using certain derivative financial instruments and changing the proportion of its fixed rate term debt versus its floating rate and short term debt 
the company may use derivatives to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk on certain debt obligations 
the company does not use derivatives for speculation and the company does not trade derivatives 
in fiscal  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements  with notional amounts totaling million  and designated them as fair value hedges of the fixed rate term notes issued in april under the terms of the swaps  the company receives fixed rates that are equal to the rates on the respective hedged notes and pays floating rates indexed to six month libor at july  on the notional amounts 
the swaps expire on the respective notes maturity dates 
the swaps effectively converted the fixed rate notes to floating rates 
the swaps reduced interest expense by  in fiscal based on six month libor at july   the swaps would reduce annual interest expense by approximately million 
the terms of the swaps follow in millions expiration notional receive july  issue date date amount rate pay rate april april july april july june july june july june at july   billion of finance receivables were fixed rate and million were indexed to the prime rate 
finance receivables provide for monthly payments for periods of two to five years 
the company experiences some prepayments that accelerate the scheduled maturities of finance receivables 
at july   million of fixed rate finance receivables are scheduled to mature within one year and the weighted average remaining maturity of fixed rate finance receivables is approximately years 
at july   fixed rate term debt as swapped was million  or of total debt outstanding 
the company s other debt  million  comprising commercial paper  bank borrowings  asset securitization financings and floating rate term notes  reprices as follows million within one month  million  within the following two months and the remainder  million  within the following six months 
fixed rate term debt million and stockholders equity million totaled million at july  this represented of total debt plus equity 
since fixed rate finance receivables exceeds this amount significantly  the company s net interest spread would be affected by fluctuations in market interest rates 
the company does not match the maturities of its debt to its finance receivables 
management periodically calculates the net earnings effect of a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in market interest rates 
at july   such a hypothetical adverse change in rates would reduce annual net earnings by approximately million and would reduce the net interest spread by approximately basis points to 
the basis point increase is of the weighted average interest rate on the company s short term and floating rate debt at july  actual future changes in market interest rates may differ materially and their effect on net earnings may also differ materially due to changes in finance receivable and debt repricing structures 
in addition  any other factors that may accompany an actual immediate basis point increase in market interest rates were not considered in the calculation 
new accounting standards on august   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no

 the million loss the company incurred on its august convertible debt redemption was reported as a separate item included in operating earnings instead of an extraordinary item net of income taxes 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires a guarantor to record a liability for the fair value of its guarantees when issued and disclose them in detail in its interim and annual financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of periods ending after december  the recognition and measurement provisions are applicable prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company generally does not issue guarantees and did not have any material guarantees at july  therefore  fin no 
did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to expense stock based employee compensation and requires prominent disclosures in annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the required disclosures appear in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not currently plan to make a voluntary change to record expense for stock options 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no
