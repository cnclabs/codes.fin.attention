item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
it is our objective to provide the most meaningful disclosures in our management s discussion and analysis in order to explain significant changes in our company s results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
as discussed in note a basis for segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page a of the appendix  our segment financial information is not based on generally accepted accounting principles and it is not intended to measure contributions to enterprise results 
therefore  it is impractical for us to try to discuss our company s results of operations and liquidity and capital resources solely based on segment information 
where practical  we have linked our discussions to segment information provided in table vi segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements on pages a through a of the appendix see reconciliation of machinery and engine sales by geographic region to external sales by marketing segme nt in item of this form k

internal engine transfers are valued at prices comparable to those for unrelated parties 
fourth quarter compared with fourth quarter fourth quarter sales and revenues were billion compared to billion in the increase of more than percent was due to a million improvement in price realization  about half of which was due to the favorable impact of currency and higher sales volume 
price realization is defined as the net impact of price changes  sales variances and currency fluctuations on sales 
sales variances include items such as warranty  special retail and wholesale incentive programs and manufacturer and cash discounts 
profit for the fourth quarter was million or cents per share compared to million or cents per share in the fourth quarter excluding the million after tax impact of unusual charges recorded in for sale of the challenger agricultural tractor line  plant closing and consolidations and costs for planned employment reductions  earnings per share increased percent 
the mill ion favorable impact of improved price realization excluding currency plus the impact of lower sg a and r d expenses were partially offset by continuing manufacturing inefficiencies related to volume shifts at most us engine manufacturing facilities 
application of the goodwill non amortization provisions of sfas resulted in a favorable pretax impact on earnings of million for the fourth quarter 
this was partially offset by a million pretax increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense 
the increase was a result of lower plan asset returns in recent years and assumed discount rates used in compared to  partially offset by the favorable pretax impact of other postretirement benefit plan changes made in the second quarter 
these changes impacted us employees only and included an increase in retiree cost sharing of health care benefits  elimination of company payments for medicare part b premiums and significant reductions in retiree life insurance 
machinery and engines machinery sales were billion  an increase of million or percent from fourth quarter sales volume for the quarter increased percent from a year ago  mainly due to year over year changes in dealer inventories 
in the fourth quarter of  dealers decreased machine inventories about percent 
in the fourth quarter of  dealer inventories increased percent  however  year end inventories compared to current selling rates were lower than year earlier levels in all regions 
page engine sales were billion  a decrease of million or percent from fourth quarter sales volume for the quarter decreased percent from a year ago 
while on highway truck and bus engine sales were flat  engine sales into the electric power  petroleum and marine sectors decreased about percent due to reduced corporate profits and continued business investment uncertainties in these industries 
operating profit fourth quarter millions of dollars machinery engines includes million of unusual charges for the sale of the challenger agricultural tractor line  plant closing and consolidations and costs for planned employment reductions 
the unusual charges were split million and million to machinery and engines  respectively 
caterpillar operations are highly integrated  therefore  the company uses a number of allocations to determine lines of business operating profit 
machinery operating profit increased million from fourth quarter excluding the million impact of unusual charges  operating profit increased million or percent 
higher sales volume contributed about million of the improvement  with the remainder due to improved price realization excluding the impact of currency and cost reduction 
engine operating profit decreased million from fourth quarter excluding the million impact of unusual charges  operating profit decreased million or percent 
lower sales volume of large reciprocating engines  volume related manufacturing inefficiencies and non conformance penalties for on highway truck and bus engines reduced operating profit by approximately million 
this was partially offset by improved price realization excluding currency and cost reduction 
interest expense was million higher than a year ago primarily due to increased long term borrowings and less capitalized interest year over year 
other income expense was income of million compared to income of million last year 
financial products financial products revenues for the fourth quarter were million  up million or percent compared with fourth quarter the favorable impact of approximately million due to the continued portfolio growth of finance receivables and leases at cat financial was partially offset by the approximately million unfavorable impact of generally lower interest rates on finance receivables

machinery and engines machinery sales were billion  a decrease of million or percent from sales volume for the year decreased percent from higher sales in asia pacific were due to higher retail demand 
sales in north america  eame and latin america declined due to lower retail demand 
sales were also affected by changes in dealer inventories

in  dealer inventories increased by about percent  however  year end inventories compared to current selling rates were lower than year earlier levels in all regions 
engine sales were billion  a decrease of million or percent from sales volume for the year decreased percent from caterpillar truck engine sales rose percent due to a surge in demand from north american truck oems for heavy duty truck engines prior to the october emissions deadline and improved truck fleet operating profits 
sales into the petroleum sector increased percent as higher sales of turbine engines more than offset a decline in sales of reciprocating engines 
these increases were more than offset by percent lower sales to the electric power sector  where financial uncertainties and depressed operating profits within the electric utility  technology and telecommunications industries impacted demand

update unusual charges in  we recorded unusual charges of million million after tax 
these charges were for the sale of the challenger agricultural tractor line  plant closing and consolidations and costs for planned employment reductions 
page during  we reduced the challenger exit cost reserve by million  primarily for cash outlays for research and development expenses and manufacturing equipment in accordance with the contract with agco 
we reduced the shrewsbury redundancy reserve by million for separation benefits for employees 
as planned  the us employment reduction was achieved entirely through voluntary retirements 
as a result  the reserve of million was reclassified to our pension accounts upon completion of the retirement program 
future cash outlays for contractual commitments for the challenger line of approximately million per year will continue through most of the diesel engine production at our shrewsbury  england plant ceased in  however  it has taken longer than anticipated to finalize the design of one replacement engine 
as a result  some diesel engine production at shrewsbury will continue through the reserve will be reduced as redundancy and exit costs are incurred through unusual charges charge asset impairments activity balance millions of dollars challenger asset impairments exit costs shrewsbury asset impairments redundancy exit costs us employment reduction other asset impairments total all amounts were paid in cash except for the us employment reduction of million  which was reclassified to our pension accounts 
supplemental information dealer machine sales to end users and deliveries to dealer rental operations worldwide dealer sales including both sales to end users and deliveries to dealer rental operations declined percent from the capital spending environment remained weak in the industrial countries of north america and europe  the result of slow economic growth  a delayed recovery in corporate profitability  the crisis in corporate governance and uncertainty associated with rising geopolitical tensions in the second half of the year 
dealer sales were also impacted by reduced cash flow in the metal and coal mining industries  which depressed worldwide equipment sales to these industries 
dealer sales including both sales to end users and deliveries to dealer rental operations in north america declined percent from  the same as industry demand 
caterpillar s share of industry sales remained at year earlier levels 
dealer sales declined in both the united states  down percent  and canada  down percent 
for the region  sales increased percent in the heavy construction sector due to higher sales to the us military  spurred by increased defense spending  and for airport construction 
in addition  sales to highway construction remained strong  as public infrastructure construction remained at high levels 
sales to the quarry and aggregates sector were up percent  due primarily to an increase in caterpillar s share of industry sales 
sales growth in these two sectors was more than offset by a percent reduction in sales to mining  especially coal 
sales to the general construction sector declined percent due to reductions in dealer rental deliveries as well as reduced purchases by residential and non residential builders 
page dealer sales in eame declined percent due to percent lower sales in europe 
general business conditions in europe were weak due to slow economic growth 
sales increased in the commonwealth of independent states  up percent  and africa middle east  up percent 
for the region  sales to the heavy construction sector increased about percent due to new product shipments  major pipeline projects in russia and infrastructure projects in the middle east 
sales to quarry and aggregate producers were up percent as well 
these increases were more than offset by percent lower sales to the general construction sector 
sales were also lower to industrial  down percent  and mining  down percent 
in asia pacific  dealer sales increased percent  led by a strong percent gain in china  as economic growth was good and public infrastructure spending increased 
for the region  sales were percent higher in the heavy construction sector and industrial sector sales grew percent 
sales also increased to the general construction sector  up percent  and the quarry and aggregates sector  up percent 
these gains more than offset percent lower sales to the mining sector  resulting from sharp cutbacks in purchases by coal mining companies 
dealer sales in latin america declined percent 
sales in mexico increased percent due to an expansion in overall construction activity  and sales in brazil increased percent due to good economic growth in the first half of the year 
however  these increases were more than offset by declines in argentina  down percent  peru  down percent and chile  down percent 
sales declined sharply in argentina due to political uncertainty while sales in peru and chile declined due to reduced cash flow in the metal mining industry 
for the region  sales were up percent in the heavy construction sector  mostly due to major pipeline projects 
this gain was more than offset by percent lower sales to the mining sector  especially metals  as well as a percent decline in sales to the general construction sector 
dealer inventories of new machines worldwide dealer new machine inventories at year end were about percent higher than levels 
inventories increased in north america  up percent  asia pacific  up percent  and eame  up percent 
dealer inventory declined percent in latin america 
despite the overall increase in dealer inventories  inventories compared to current selling rates were lower than year earlier levels in all regions 
engine sales to end users and oems worldwide engine sales to dealer customers and oems were up percent in sales to the on highway truck and bus sector rose percent and sales to the petroleum sector rose percent  more than offsetting percent lower sales to the electric power sector and percent lower sales to the marine sector 
similar to the market fundamentals discussed above for construction machinery  global engine sales were impacted by the weak capital spending environment in industrialized countries and depressed operating profits and heightened investor uncertainties concerning new electric utility and energy investments 
in north america  caterpillar sales of on highway truck and bus engines rose percent but were more than offset by lower sales in electric power  down percent  petroleum  down percent  and marine  down percent 
north american sales were impacted by sluggish economic growth  weak corporate profits  continuing economic uncertainties and delayed new investments 
caterpillar widened its leadership position in the north american on highway truck and bus industry  caterpillar s share of industry demand rose significantly for both heavy duty and midrange truck engines 
the heavy duty truck industry and caterpillar heavy duty truck engine demand were substantially higher than we originally expected for we estimate about  extra heavy duty trucks were built in to accommodate an artificial surge in customer demand for trucks with engines built before the october emissions deadline 
this artificial demand added an estimated million to caterpillar s truck engine sales  repr esenting about percent of the total year over year sales increase to the on highway truck and bus sector 
in eame  overall sales declined percent  with a percent increase in demand for larger reciprocating and turbine engines used in the petroleum sector more than offset by and percent lower sales into the electric power and marine sectors  respectively 
electric power and marine engine sales were impacted by weakening economic trends in western europe and increased business uncertainty which delayed new business investment decisions 
page sales in asia pacific rose percent with sales gains in all sectors except electric power where sales declined percent 
sales of large reciprocating and turbine engines used in the petroleum sector surged percent  as developing countries in asia pacific and latin america increased oil and gas exploration and development to raise local energy production and offset higher costs of imported fuels 
sales in latin america increased percent with sales gains in all sectors and pronounced strength in large reciprocating and turbine engine sales into the petroleum and marine sectors  which rose and percent  respectively 
compared with sales and revenues for were billion  percent more than the increase was due to higher sales volume of about million and increased financial products revenues of approximately million  which were partially offset by approximately million of lower price realization 
more than percent of the price realization detriment was due to the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar on sales in other currencies  primarily the euro and australian dollar 
profit of million  including unusual charges of million million after tax  was down million 
these charges were for the sale of the challenger agricultural tractor line  plant closing and consolidations and costs for planned employment reductions 
excluding unusual charges  profit was million  down million or percent 
the combined effect of higher sales volume and a net favorable currency impact of approximately million was more than offset by cost inefficiencies resulting from sharp volume shifts at some manufacturing facilities and higher sg a expenses related to spending for future growth and improving long term cost structure 
the net favorable currency impact occurred as the negative impact of currency on sales was more than offset by a positive impact on costs 
machinery and engines machinery sales were billion  an increase over of million resulting from a percent increase in sales volume 
sales were higher in all regions except latin america  which was about flat 
in north america  sales increases due to higher share of industry sales and a slower rate of dealer inventory reduction more than offset reduced industry demand 
in eame and asia pacific  improved retail demand more than offset the impact of reductions in dealer inventory 
sales in latin america remained near levels as higher retail demand offset reductions in dealer inventory 
engine sales were billion  a decrease of million or percent from even though sales volume was flat 
unfavorable price realization resulting from competitive pressures in north america combined with the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar on sales in other currencies caused the sales decline 
higher sales in the electric power  petroleum and marine sectors were offset by a substantial drop in truck engine sales 
machinery operating profit decreased million from the favorable impact of higher sales volume and the net favorable impact of currency were more than offset by higher costs  including unusual charges of million  employment related cost increases and higher energy costs 
engine operating profit decreased million from the decline was primarily due to lower price realization  manufacturing inefficiencies related to sharp swings in production levels and unusual charges of million 
interest expense was million lower than a year ago as lower effective borrowing rates more than offset the impact of higher borrowings 
other income expense improved by million due to lower foreign currency losses primarily the british pound in financial products revenues for were a record billion  up million or percent compared with excluding revenue transactions with machinery and engines  revenues increased million or percent 
the increase resulted primarily from a billion increase in the portfolio at cat financial 
page before tax profit increased million or percent from record profit at cat financial resulted from an approximate one percentage point increase in the spread on the receivables portfolio and increased gains of million on sales of receivables 
the wider interest rate spread on the portfolio was principally a result of s interest rate environment  where the continuing rapid decrease in rates allowed cat financial s debt rates to decrease more rapidly than the portfolio rates because we are not match funded 
as rates stabilize or increase our interest rate spread is expected to narrow accordingly 
the increase in gains on sales of receivables at cat financial was due to north american dealer trade receivables purchased from caterpillar inc that were paid earlier than estimated at their purchase date 
cat financial purchases trade receivables each week at discounts that are expected to yield a market rate of interest over their term 
because the discounts are based on estimates as to when the receivables will be paid  the actual yield on the receivables can be higher or lower than the rates used to determine the discounts 
in the yield was higher because the receivables paid substantially earlier than estimated 
however  similar results are not expected in future periods 
income taxes excluding the tax effect of the unusual charges reported in and the favorable tax adjustment of million at caterpillar brasil ltda 
in  tax expense in both years reflects an effective tax rate of percent 
unconsolidated affiliated companies the company s share of unconsolidated affiliated companies results increased million from a year ago  primarily due to stronger results at shin caterpillar mitsubishi ltd 
unusual charges in december  we signed an agreement with agco to sell the design  assembly and marketing of the new mt series of caterpillar s challenger high tech farm tractors during the first quarter of by selling the challenger we will avoid the substantial new investment in distribution that would be required to make this product profitable 
the sale will also provide our distribution network the expanded line of agricultural products it needs to be successful 
a total charge of million was recognized for the challenger sale 
these charges reflect the provisions of the agreement with agco and are comprised of the following million for write downs of land  buildings and equipment at our dekalb  illinois  facility to fair market value based on the negotiated contract price with agco 
million for exit costs 
the contract with agco requires that we complete the design of the new challenger tractor  ensure a successful market launch and pay for the remaining capital assets required for the production of the tractor 
these amounts reflect our estimate of costs to fulfill our contract obligations and will be incurred in also included in exit costs are contractual obligations that will remain after the sale to agco but will provide no benefit to caterpillar 
these obligations range from one to seven years 
in december  we announced plans to cease production of diesel engines at the perkins engines shrewsbury  england plant by the end of production will be reallocated to other caterpillar engine facilities to better leverage technology and capacity 
upon closure of the plant  we expect an annual benefit to cost of goods sold of approximately million 
this represents lower overhead and other fixed manufacturing expenses as the production moves to other existing caterpillar locations 
a total charge of million was recognized for the closing and comprised the following million for write downs of land  buildings and equipment to fair market value as determined by third party appraisers 
million of separation costs for termination of employees at the shrewsbury plant 
these benefits were communicated to impacted employees in december 
exit costs of million associated with closing the facility 
page in december  we announced plans to reduce us salaried and management employment by people at selected business units during the first half of these reductions are being made to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in support of our long term growth and profitability goals 
we expect this reduction to be achieved through voluntary early retirements but if the reduction goal is not met  we will use involuntary separations 
the charge of million for this program reflects the cost of retirement incentives 
we expect lower annual labor costs of approximately million after completion of the employment reduction 
other unusual charges of million were for write downs of two manufacturing buildings  one at our decatur  illinois  facility and one at our kiel  germany  facility 
liquidity capital resources sources of funds the company generates its capital resources primarily through operations 
consolidated operating cash flow was billion for  compared with billion for the increase is primarily the result of concerted efforts to reduce inventory and other working capital in response to the current economic environment 
we anticipate that the majority of future capital resource requirements will be funded by operating cash flow  which is largely sourced from profits 
see our outlook in item of this form k 
total debt as of december  was billion  an increase of billion from year end debt related to machinery and engines decreased million  due to improved operating cash flow and lower capital expenditures 
debt related to financial products increased billion due to portfolio growth at cat financial 
we have a global credit facility of billion available to both machinery and engines and cat financial to support commercial paper programs 
cat financial may use up to percent of the available facility subject to a maximum debt to equity and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
machinery and engines may use up to percent of the available facility subject to a minimum level of net worth 
based on these restrictions  and the allocation decisions of available credit made by management  the portion of the facility available to cat financial at december   was billion 
the facility is c omprised of two components   million expiring in september and  million expiring in september the facility expiring in september has a provision which allows caterpillar to obtain a one year loan in september that matures in september our total credit commitments as of december  were consolidated machinery and engines financial products millions of dollars credit lines available global credit facility    other external  intercompany total credit lines available    utilized credit unused credit    we also generate funding through the securitization of receivables

page critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
the more significant estimates include residual values for leased assets  fair market values for goodwill impairment tests  impairment of available for sale securities  and reserves for warranty  product liability and insurance losses  postemployment benefits  post sale discounts  credit losses and certain unusual charges 
we use the following methods and assumptions in determining our estimates residual values for leased assets determined based on the product  specifications  application and hours of usage 
each product has its own model for evaluation that includes market value cycles and forecasts 
consideration is also given to the number of machines that will be returned from lease during a given time frame 
fair market values for goodwill impairment tests determined for each reporting unit by discounting projected cash flow for the upcoming five years and adding a year five residual value based upon a market earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiple 
impairment of available for sale securities securities are reviewed monthly to identify market values below cost of percent or more 
if a decline for a debt security is in excess of percent for months  the investment is evaluated to determine if the decline is due to general declines in the marketplace or if the investment has been impaired and should be written down to market value pursuant to sfas after the month period  debt securities with declines from cost in excess of percent are evaluated monthly for impairment 
for equity securities  if a decline from cost of percent or more continues for a month period  an other than temporary impairment is recognized without continued analysis 
warranty reserve determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory 
generally  historical claim rates are developed using a month rolling average of actual warranty expense 
these rates are applied to the field population and dealer inventory to determine the reserve 
product liability and insurance loss reserve determined based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported 
postemployment benefit reserve determined in accordance with sfas  and using the assumptions detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
post sale discount reserve the company extends numerous merchandising programs that provide discounts to dealers as products are sold to end users 
the reserve is determined based on historical data adjusted for known changes in merchandising programs 
credit loss reserve determined by applying historical credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio with consideration given to the condition of the economy and trends in past due accounts 
unusual charge reserve determined in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the situation 
unusual charges discussed in note on page a to the consolidated financial statements were estimated in accordance with sfas and and eitf we have incorporated many years of historical data into the determination of each of these estimates 
we have a proven history of using accurate estimates and sound assumptions to calculate and record appropriate reserves and residual values 
page employment at december   caterpillar s worldwide employment was  compared with  one year ago 
the company reduced employment by  or about percent during before the impact of acquisitions  which added people 
full time employees at year end inside us    outside us    total    by region north america    eame    latin america    asia pacific    total    other matters environmental and legal matters the company is regulated by federal  state and international environmental laws governing our use of substances and control of emissions in all our operations 
compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
we are cleaning up hazardous waste at a number of locations  often with other companies  pursuant to federal and state laws 
when it is likely we will pay clean up costs at a site and those costs can be estimated  the costs are charged against our earnings 
in making that estimate  we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies and others 
the amount set aside for environmental cleanup is not material and is included in accrued expenses in statement of the consolidated financial statements on page a of the appendix 
if a range of liability estimates is available on a particular site  we accrue the lower end of that range 
we cannot estimate costs on sites in the very early stages of cleanup 
currently  we have five sites in the very early stages of cleanup  and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for cleanup will be required 
pursuant to a consent decree caterpillar entered with the united states environmental protection agency epa  the company was required to meet certain emission standards by october the decree provides that if the manufacturers were unable to meet the standards at that time they would be required to pay a non conformance penalty ncp on each engine sold that did not meet the standard 
the amount of the ncp would be based on how close to meeting the standard the engine came the more out of compliance the higher the penalty 
the company began shipping lower emission engines in october as a bridge until fully compliant advanced combustion emission reduction technology acert engines are introduced in page the consent decree also provided the ability to bank emissions credits prior to october that could be used to offset non conforming engines produced after january  that is  if a company was able to produce and sell engines that were below the applicable standard prior to october  then the company could apply the emission credits created by those engines to engines produced after january  that do not meet the consent decree standard 
for example  an engine produced and sold prior to october that produced grams of nox as compared to gram standard would create a gram credit 
this credit would be banked to be used to offset the nox deficiency of an engine produced after january  that did not meet the consent decree standard 
given this scenario  a company could produce and sell a gram engine in without paying an ncp even though the engine exceeds the gram standard 
caterpillar has a legal righ t  as described in the consent decree  to use its banked credits as offsets against ncps for non compliant engines produced after december  the epa has approved the process by which the credits are calculated 
we produced and sold  medium heavy duty engines prior to october that yielded emissions below the applicable standard for that period  resulting in  mg of medium heavy duty banked credits 
we expect to produce approximately  non conforming medium heavy duty engines after january   but we do not expect to pay any ncps on these medium duty engines in due to our banked credits 
we produced and sold heavy duty engines in resulting in  mg of heavy duty banked credits 
of the approximately  non conforming heavy duty engines we expect to build after january   these banked credits are expected to offset the ncps on approximately  of these units 
we began production of medium heavy duty acert engines complying with the epa emissions standards in early caterpillar received certification from the epa in january for the c diesel engine  the first of our new engines equipped with acert technology 
we began shipping of the c which was certified to the more stringent transit bus standards in march 
we received certification for our second acert equipped model  the c in march and this engine will be in production in june of we anticipate that our heavy heavy duty models the c and c the acert versions of the current c and c  respectively will be in full production by october and the c the acert version of the current c will be in full production by december after the epa has certified each engine 
as a result  we do not anticipate paying ncps beyond the certification process is described in the consent decree and the regulations  and includes the following the durability of the engine is established through testing to determine if the engine emissions change with time 
an emissions deterioration factor is determined that represents the amount of emission deterioration that would be expected over the useful life of the engine 
an emission data engine is tested according to the regulations 
emission levels are determined on various steady state and transient tests 
the results from the two tests are submitted to the epa in a certification application as proof that the engine meets the requirements along with additional information and a request that a certificate be granted 
the epa reviews the application and if all the regulatory requirements are met  a certificate is issued 
if the engine exceeds the standard  the epa issues a certificate for either a banked or an ncp engine 
the ncp engine certificate requires production compliance auditing pca testing 
after receipt of the epa certificate manufacturing and shipment of the certified engines can begin 
each engine is labeled to indicate that it is certified 
page our expense for ncps was million in this amount was based on levels that we believed the engines would perform when tested 
for  we paid ncps on  heavy duty units and  medium heavy duty units  and in we estimate we will pay ncps on  heavy duty units 
the actual ncp amount will not be known until final testing with the epa is completed with all models during our estimates of the ncp amounts are based on our knowledge of how each of the engine models is expected to perform in pca testing 
caterpillar can make fairly accurate predictions of the emissions profiles of its engines due to its engineering knowledge  development process  and prior testing of its engines during development 
pca testing on medium heavy duty engines has now been completed  pca testing on heavy heavy duty engines is on going 
therefore  while pca testing has not been concluded  we are confident that our ncp and credit consumption estimates will be fairly accurate 
aside from million in customary research and development expenses  emissions standard changes negatively impacted our financial results by million million after tax or about cents per share as ncps million pre tax  product cost increases and ramp up production costs million pre tax were partially offset by price increases for these engines million pre tax 
we recorded the million for ncps when the bridge engines were produced  and either have paid or will pay the epa from an escrow account no later than days after pca testing on an engine class is complete 
for example  on january   caterpillar deposited million the recorded million based on our estimates plus an additional million following the completion of pca testing with an escrow agent for estimated ncps related to fourth quarter bridge engine production 
this included million for medium heavy duty engine models and million for heavy duty engine models 
after comple tion of epa testing of high horsepower medium heavy duty engines  on march  caterpillar released million from the escrow account to the epa 
after completion of testing of the remaining medium heavy duty engine models  on march  caterpillar released the remaining million from the medium heavy duty engine escrow account and paid an additional  to the epa because the tested level of ncps for that engine family was slightly higher per engine than was anticipated at the time of the january escrow deposit 
the following table reflects the impact of the emission standard changes millions of dollars price engines sold x price increase incremental costs cost of additional materials ncps engines sold x projected ncp per engine net effect pre tax tax net effect after tax in addition to the above  the consent decree required caterpillar to pay a fine of million  which was expensed in and to make investments totaling million in environmental related products by july  total qualifying investments to date for these projects is million  of which million was made in a future benefit is expected to be realized from these environmental projects related to caterpillar s ability to capitalize on the technologies it developed in complying with its environmental project obligations 
in short  caterpillar expects to receive a positive net return on the environmental projects by being able to market the technology it developed 
page as of december  we expect the net unfavorable impact of emission standard changes in to be no more than as we estimate that significantly higher ncps approximately million pre tax  product cost increases and ramp up production costs approximately million pre tax  will be partially offset by price increases for bridge and acert engines approximately million pre tax 
for example  we estimate that we will sell  c engines in that will be subject to ncps 
we also estimate that the blended there are multiple models of the c ncp per engine will be  caterpillar is not required to make any payment to the epa for these engines until pca testing for the engine model has been completed 
however  caterpillar is required to place an amount equal to its estimated ncps for that engine model into an escrow account on a quarterly basis 
as a result  we will record approximately million for ncps as the bridge engines are produced and once pca testing is com pleted for an engine model  we will pay the epa the ncps on these engine sales out of the established escrow accounts on a quarterly basis 
the following table reflects the projected impact of the emission standard changes millions of dollars price bridge or acert price increase x projected engine sales incremental costs cost of additional materials ncps projected ncp per engine x projected engine sales banked credits net effect pre tax tax net effect after tax as reflected in this table  our projections for are subject to assumptions regarding projected ncps  price increases and volumes 
for example  our estimate of ncps per engine could change from the average per heavy duty engine based on the results of on going epa testing  this testing could impact both the ncp level per engine and the utilization of banked credits 
however  we are able to make fairly accurate predictions of the results of the epa tests due to our engineering knowledge  development process and internal testing during development 
our net price increase for heavy duty bridge engines was successfully implemented on october   this increase was competitive with price increases implemented by other engine manufacturers on that date 
with the introduction of acert engines in  there will be an additional price increase to truck manufacturers that purchase our engines 
this increase has been communicated to the truck manufacturers and is based on the additional value that we expect truck owners to receive from acert engines compared to our competitors as a result of better fuel economy  less maintenance and greater durability 
the ultimate net price increase we are able to achieve for our acert engines is dependent upon marketplace acceptance of these engines versus competitive alternatives 
while we estimate volume to the best of our ability  industry volume is an issue out of our control 
we will revise our disclosures in future filings accordingly if the actual ncp amount in vary materially from our projections  if the market unexpectedly will not bear the planned price increase or if our estimated volumes prove to have been materially too conservative or optimistic 
page on august   a world trade organization wto arbitration panel determined that the european union eu may impose up to billion per year in retaliatory tariffs if the us tax code is not brought into compliance with an august wto decision that found the extraterritorial tax eti provisions of the fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures 
since august  the eu has been developing a proposed list of us origin products on which the eu could impose tariffs as high as percent of the value of the product 
negotiations among eu member states  the european commission  and the private sector over which products are listed have been intense 
that list has not yet been finalized  the eu has not announced that they will impose a retaliatory tariff  and it is unclear the extent to which the company s products will be subject to a retaliatory tariff but based on w hat we know today  we do not believe it will materially impact our financial results 
assuming the eu implemented a retaliatory tariff and certain company products were subject to percent tariffs  the company s competitive position in the european market would not be significantly affected 
the company has production facilities in the eu  russia  asia  and south america that would not be affected by a retaliatory tariff aimed at us origin products 
if the eu implemented its proposed retaliatory tariff  increased pressure would be placed on congress to repeal eti  possibly during the th congress 
based on current information related to this matter  it is not possible to predict how the us legislative process will affect the company s tax liability  but based on what we know today  we do not believe the impact  if any  will be material in on january   caterpillar commenced an action against navistar international transportation corporation and international truck and engine corporation navistar 
caterpillar seeks a declaratory judgment upholding a long term purchase contract plus damages arising from navistar s alleged breach of contract 
on january   caterpillar filed its first amended complaint to add four additional defendants and to add claims alleging that two of the new defendants colluded with navistar to utilize technology misappropriated from caterpillar 
at december   the past due receivable from navistar related to this case was million 
on january   navistar commenced an action against caterpillar that alleges we breached various aspects of the long term purchase contract 
on april   the court granted caterpillar s motion for involuntary dismissal of this action  navistar subsequently asserted its claims as counterclaims in the action caterpillar file d in peoria 
we believe navistar s claims are without merit  and resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
on may   international truck and engine corporation international commenced an action against caterpillar in the circuit court of dupage county  illinois that alleges caterpillar breached various aspects of a long term agreement term sheet 
in its third amended complaint  international seeks a declaration from the court that the term sheet constitutes a legally binding contract for the sale of heavy duty engines at specified prices through the end of  alleges that caterpillar breached the term sheet by raising certain prices effective october   and also alleges that caterpillar breached an obligation to negotiate a comprehensive long term agreement referenced in the term sheet 
international further claims that caterpillar improperly restricted the supply of heavy duty engines to international from june through september international seeks damages in an amount to be determined at trial and injunctive relief 
caterpillar filed an answer denying international s clai ms and has filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration that the term sheet has effectively been terminated 
caterpillar denies international s claims and will vigorously contest them 
the company further believes that final resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
this matter is not related to the breach of contract action brought by caterpillar against international currently pending in the circuit court of peoria county  illinois 
postretirement benefits in we recognized a net pension benefit of million compared with a benefit of million in the decrease was primarily a result of continued poor performance of the equity markets and lower than expected long term returns on pension plan assets 
sfas  employers accounting for pensions requires companies to use an expected long term rate of return for computing current year pension expense 
differences between the actual and expected returns are amortized into future earnings as actuarial gains and losses 
at the end of  unrecognized actuarial losses of billion primarily reflect lower than expected returns on our pension plan assets 
page other postretirement benefit expense was million in  up million from an increase resulting from several unfavorable items including inflation on health care costs and lower actual return on plan assets was almost entirely offset by changes to our us benefit plans implemented during second quarter these changes include an increase in retiree cost sharing of health care benefits  elimination of company payments for medicare part b premiums and significant reductions in retiree life insurance 
in total  these changes lowered our existing benefit obligation by approximately million  which will be amortized into earnings over seven years the average remaining service period of employees affected by the plan changes 
in addition to this amortization  our ongoing annual expense will decrease approximately million from the plan changes 
a benefit of million reflecting the partial year impact of the plan changes representing both the amortizatio n and ongoing impact of the changes was recognized in unrecognized actuarial losses for other postretirement plans were million at the end of these losses reflect lower than expected plan asset returns  higher than expected benefit costs  a decrease in the assumed discount rate and an increase in expected health care inflation 
these losses will be amortized into future earnings in accordance with sfas  employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the unrecognized actuarial losses will be impacted in future periods by actual asset returns  actual health care inflation  discount rate changes and other factors that impact pension and other postretirement benefit expenses 
sfas requires the recognition of an additional minimum liability if the market value of plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation at the end of the plan year 
based on these values  the company increased the additional minimum liability by million in the fourth quarter of this resulted in a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of shareholder s equity on the statement of financial position of million after tax 
during  the company made cash contributions of million to its us defined benefit pension plans  which make up about percent of the company s total pension liability 
the company continues to have adequate liquidity resources to fund plans  as it deems necessary 
future changes to the additional minimum liability will be dependent on several factors including actual returns on our pension plan assets  company contributions  benefit plan changes and our assumed discount rate 
actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on both pension and other postretirement benefit expenses 
the effect of a one percentage point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on benefit costs and year end obligations is included in the table below 
postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions sensitivity following are the effects of a one percentage point change in our primary pension and other postretirement benefit actuarial assumptions on pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations benefit cost year end benefit obligation one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease millions of dollars pension benefits assumed discount rate  expected rate of compensation increase expected long term rate of return on plan assets other postretirement benefits assumed discount rate expected rate of compensation increase expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumed health care cost trend rate page the assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligations back to today s dollars 
the us discount rate is based on the moody s aa bond yield as of our measurement date  november a similar process is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our non us pension plans 
the discount rates used to calculate benefit plan expense were percent for us plans and percent for us plans 
the discount rates for will be percent for us plans and percent for non us plans 
the expected rate of compensation increase is used to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement 
it represents average long term salary increases 
the rate was percent for us benefit plans and percent for non us pension plans 
our us expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our pension assets 
based on historical performance  we add percent to the passive returns due to our active management 
a similar process is used to determine this rate for our non us pension plans 
the expected long term rates of return used to calculate benefit plan expense were percent for us plans and percent for non us plans 
the expected long term rates of return for will be percent for us plans and percent for us plans 
the assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase 
to calculate benefit expense  we assumed an increase of percent for this rate was assumed to decrease gradually to the ultimate health care trend rate of percent in this rate represents percent general inflation plus percent additional health care inflation 
based on our recent expenses and our forecast of changes  we expect an increase of percent during with no change to the ultimate trend rate 
sensitivity foreign exchange rate sensitivity based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our machinery and engines operations for the next months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year end  a hypothetical percent weakening of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected cash flow for our machinery and engines operations by million 
last year  similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential million adverse impact on cash flow 
we determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflows and outflows by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments 
we multiply these net amounts by percent to determine the sensitivity 
since our policy for financial products operations is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio does not match the currency of our receivable portfolio  a percent change in the value of the us dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
neither our policy nor the effect of a percent change in the value of the us dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year 
the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables  including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact  the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above 
in addition  it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen 
interest rate sensitivity for our machinery and engines operations  we have the option to use interest rate swaps to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed to floating interest rate swaps to fixed rate debt 
however  we currently do not have any interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect pretax earnings of machinery and engines by million 
last year  similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential million adverse impact on pretax earnings 
this effect is caused by the interest rate fluctuations on our short term debt 
page for our financial products operations  we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match funding objectives and strategies 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect the pretax earnings of financial products by million 
last year  similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential million adverse impact on pretax earnings 
to estimate the impact of interest rate sensitivity on our income  we compute the difference in baseline and sensitized interest expense over the next months 
we determine the baseline interest expense by applying a market interest rate to the unmatched portion of our debt portfolio 
the unmatched portion of our portfolio is an estimate of fixed rate assets funded by floating rate liabilities 
we incorporate the effects of interest rate swap agreements in the estimate of our unmatched portfolio 
we determine the sensi tized interest expense by adding basis points to the market interest rate applied to baseline interest expense and apply this rate to the unmatched portfolio 
our analysis assumes no new fixed rate assets were extended and no further action was taken to alter our current interest rate sensitivity 
the effect of the hypothetical change in interest rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in actual sales volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that management would take in response to such a change are also ignored 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
outlook economic and industry summary worldwide economic and geopolitical uncertainties remained at relatively elevated levels in the early weeks of we expect this will dampen the economic recovery in the first half of  but growth is expected to accelerate in the second half  leading to worldwide growth of about percent for the year as a whole 
in this environment  industry opportunity is expected to be about the same as our outlook is based on and subject to the following economic and business condition assumptions the geopolitical tensions in the middle east remain high  but do not degenerate into a major lengthy armed conflict  the benefits from lower european interest rates offset fiscal tightening in several major european countries  the us congress approves in early about billion in current fiscal year transportation funding and additional fiscal stimulus measures are passed by the end of the second quarter and investor confidence improves as corporate earnin gs grow and trust is restored in the reliability of corporate reporting and oversight 
north america geopolitical and federal policy uncertainties in early are expected to dampen the strength of the first half economic recovery 
we assume these uncertainties will diminish and become less of a drag on growth in the second half of for the year as a whole  we expect economic growth of about percent  supported by low interest rates and fiscal stimulus policies 
the us congress is expected to pass a large fiscal stimulus package in the first half of the package  combined with the positive impact of previously enacted federal stimulus measures  is expected to more than offset state budget cutbacks  with most of the positive impact in the second half of the year 
in addition  improved corporate earnings and cash flows  more accommodating credit conditions and a return to more normal commercial insurance coverage are also expected to provide support for stronger business capital spending in the second half of construction activity is expected to be about flat  while industrial an d mining activity is expected to be up about percent 
industry sales of construction  industrial and mining machinery are expected to be about flat 
industry demand for reciprocating and turbine engines is expected to be down about percent 
eame in eame  we expect economic growth in europe of about percent  and about percent growth in the cis  africa and the middle east 
while a recovery in europe is expected  it will be restrained by a stronger euro and ongoing fiscal restraint in several major industrial countries 
in africa and the middle east  oil exporters and precious metal producers are expected to benefit from good price levels  whereas most other commodity prices are expected to remain weak 
we expect the cis to grow at a solid rate  driven mainly by continued strong expansion of the oil and gas industry 
machine industry sales in eame are expected to be about flat  while engine industry sales are also expected to be about flat 
page latin america market conditions in latin america are expected to be mixed 
we expect overall economic growth rates in mexico and argentina to improve  leading to higher industry sales 
industry sales in peru are expected to be about flat 
relatively slow growth in brazil and chile and continued political instability in venezuela are expected to lead to lower industry machine sales in these markets 
for latin america in total  machine and engine industry sales are expected to be down about percent 
asia pacific we expect good overall economic growth in the asia pacific region excluding japan based on moderate growth in australia and continued good growth in the developing economies  particularly southeast asia  china and india 
in japan  economic and business conditions are expected to continue to be difficult  and machine industry sales are projected to be about flat at cyclically depressed levels 
industry machine sales in the asia pacific region are expected to be up about percent  while engine and turbine industry sales are projected to be down about percent 
company summary company sales and revenues are expected to be about the same as company sales in eame are projected to be up about percent  while company sales into asia pacific are expected to be up about percent 
in north america  company sales are expected to be down about percent  while company sales in latin america are expected to be down about percent 
financial products revenues are expected to increase approximately percent  primarily driven by cat financial s record portfolio additions in we anticipate improved operational results will offset most of the million or approximately cents per share of higher retiree pension  health care and related benefit costs 
therefore  despite flat sales and revenues and these increased costs  profit should be down only about percent compared to safe harbor statement under the securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained in our management s discussion and analysis are forward looking and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results 
the words believes  expects  estimates  anticipates  will be and similar words or expressions identify forward looking statements made on behalf of caterpillar 
uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses  as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves 
world economic factors our current outlook calls for moderate growth in the us economy in our outlook assumes that the events of september  and the resulting impact on the economy were a one time event and that there will be no further events of this magnitude 
if  however  there are other significant shocks or sequence of shocks  financial  economic or acts of war and or political terror  there could be a more protracted negative impact on consumer spending  housing starts  and capital spending which would negatively impact company results 
us gdp growth is expected to continue at moderate rates in should recent interest rate reductions and fiscal stimulus measures fail to boost growth in the us economy as expected  leading to renewed economic weakness  then sales of machines and engines may be lower than expected 
the outlook also projects that economic growth will continue in asia pacific  africa middle east and the cis 
growth is expected to improve in europe  japan and latin america 
if  for any reason  these projected growth rates or improvements do not occur  sales would likely be lower than anticipated in the affected region 
persistent weakness in the construction sector in japan is leading to lower machine sales in the japanese market 
in general  renewed currency speculation  significant declines in the stock markets  further oil or energy price increases  political disruptions or higher interest rates could result in weaker than anticipated economic growth and worldwide sales of both machines and engines could be lower than expected as a result 
economic recovery could also be delayed or weakened by growing budget or current account deficits or inappropriate government policies 
in particular  our outlook assumes that europe  the united kingdom and canada maintain economic stimulus policies and that the japanese government remains committed to stimulating their economic recovery with appropriate monetary and fiscal policies 
the outlook also assumes that the brazilian government follows through with promised fiscal and structural reforms  and that the venezuela crisis is confined to venezuela and does not spill over to negatively impact growth prospects in neighboring countries 
if political instability continues to deteriorate leading to negative spillover effects  this could result in greater regional economic and financial uncertainty and weaker regional growth 
page our outlook for also assumes that currency markets remain relatively stable  that average world oil prices fluctuate in a range of to a barrel  and equity markets recover 
if commodity and or currency markets experience a significant increase in volatility  and or stock markets show further weakness  uncertainty would increase  both of which would result in slower economic growth  lower sales and potential impairment of investments 
in addition  an eruption of political violence in the middle east or a lengthy armed conflict with iraq could lead to oil supply disruptions and persistent upward pressure on oil prices 
in this case business and consumer confidence would fall and inflation pressures would move up leading to slower world economic growth and lower company sales 
the russian economy has improved  but political and economic uncertainty remains high and an unexpected deterioration could impact worldwide stock or currency markets  which in turn could weaken company sales 
commodity prices the outlook for our sales also depends on commodity prices 
industrial metal prices recovered in  and further gains are projected in but production rates are depressed and machine sales to the industrial metals industry are expected to be about flat 
oil prices remained flat near in we are expecting oil prices to be about flat an average price of to a barrel in based on this forecast  equipment sales into sectors that are sensitive to crude oil prices oil  oil sands  coal and natural gas are expected to be about flat 
if  for whatever reason  average oil prices are significantly higher in  our results would be negatively impacted 
extended weakness in world economic growth could lead to sharp declines in commodity prices and production and lower than expected sales to the industrial metals and agriculture sectors 
monetary and fiscal policies for most companies operating in a global economy  monetary and fiscal policies implemented in the us and abroad could have a significant impact on economic growth  and  accordingly  demand for a product 
in the united states  the federal reserve reduced interest rates in these actions  together with projected federal tax cuts  and other fiscal stimulus measures are expected to lead to moderate us growth in  with some acceleration in momentum in the second half 
in europe  the european central bank reduced interest rates in  further reductions are expected and growth in europe is expected to improve in however  recent currency movements leading to a stronger euro may dampen european growth prospects in and this would cause machine sales to be lower than expected 
in general  higher than expected interest rates  reductions in government spending  higher taxes  significant currency devaluations  and uncertainty over key policies are some factors likely to lead to slower economic growth and lower industry demand 
the current outlook is for moderate us growth in near 
this is expected to lead to about flat industry sales levels 
if  for whatever reason  there was a setback leading to weak or negative growth in  then demand for company products could fall in the us and canada and would also be lower throughout the rest of the world 
political factors political factors in the us and abroad have a major impact on global companies 
in  the us congress enacted a tax cut with the first reductions effective in the third and fourth quarters of and with additional benefits in  which is having and should continue to have a positive impact on the us economy 
the company is one of the largest us exporters as a percentage of sales 
international trade and fiscal policies implemented in the us this year could impact the company s ability to expand its business abroad 
us foreign relations with certain countries and any related restrictions imposed could also have a significant impact on foreign sales 
there are a number of significant political developments in latin america  asia  and africa middle east which are expected to take place in that could affect us trade policies and or de stabilize local market conditions leading to lower company sales 
in particular  a recent escalation of political uncertainty in venezuela and the middle east is contributing to a decline in business confidence and reduced capital investment intentions 
in addition  significant political and economic instability persists in argentina  venezuela  the middle east and indonesia 
our outlook assumes that the effects of instability in venezuela will be confined to venezuela and not spread to other countries in the region 
our outlook also assumes that stability will ultimately be restored in argentina  indonesia and venezuela through democratic means 
if  however  the instability persists  worsens or spreads to other countries in the region  it could materially impact company sales into argentina  indonesia  venezuela and other countries in the region 
in addition  our outlook assumes that the recent escalation of the conflict in the middle east does not deteriorate further into a significant armed conflict 
in addition  we assume that recent terrorist incidents in indonesia do not lead to a major  persistent escalation of political and economic uncertainty in that country 
in recent months there has been a significant escalation in political tensions in north korea 
caterpillar does not sell machine or engine products to north korea and our outlook assumes there will not be a military conflict there 
if  however  there is a significant escalation of political tensions in north korea  leading to a significant military build up or increase in hostilities between north and south korea  it could have a negative impact on sales to south korea and other neighboring countries in the asia pacific region 
page our outlook also assumes that there will be no major  lengthy armed conflict in iraq 
if such a lengthy armed conflict does arise  it is iikely business and consumer confidence will drop sharply  resulting in stagnant worldwide economic growth and declines in worldwide business demand 
in this scenario  worldwide company sales would likely fall about percent from currency fluctuations currency fluctuations are also an unknown for global companies 
the company has facilities in major sales areas throughout the world and significant costs and revenues in most major currencies 
this diversification greatly reduces the overall impact of currency movements on results 
however  if the us dollar strengthens suddenly against foreign currencies  the conversion of net non us dollar proceeds to non us dollars would somewhat adversely impact the company s results 
since the company s largest manufacturing presence is in the us  any unexpected strengthening of the us dollar versus key overseas currencies could have an unfavorable impact on our global competitiveness 
dealer practices a majority of the company s sales are made through its independent dealer distribution network 
dealer practices  such as changes in inventory levels for both new and rental equipment  are not within the company s control primarily because these practices depend upon the dealer s assessment of anticipated sales and the appropriate level of inventory and may have a significant positive or negative impact on our results 
in particular  the outlook assumes that dealer inventories of new machines will be slightly lower at the end of than at the end of if dealers reduce inventory levels more than anticipated  company sales will be adversely impacted 
other factors the rate of infrastructure spending  housing starts  commercial construction and mining play a significant role in the company s results 
our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease in the us or abroad  demand for our products may be significantly impacted 
in  the six year federal highway bill did not boost us sales as much as anticipated due to delays in getting major capital projects for highways underway 
in there was an increase in the volume of highway construction contracts  which had a positive impact on sales of certain types of equipment 
highway construction contracts in were up slightly  and heavy construction machine sales were also up slightly 
however  an appropriations bill approving federal funding for highways  streets  bridges  airports  etc 
for fiscal the final year of the tea legislation has been delayed 
the baseline outlook assumes that a new transportation appropriations bill is passed in early that maintains funding levels in near levels 
if funding is reduced  sales could be negatively impacted 
furthermore  if infrastructure spending plans are reduced by federal and or state governments due to budget constraints  machine sales will likely be lower in pursuant to a consent decree caterpillar entered into with the united states environmental protection agency epa  the company was required to meet certain emission standards by october the consent decree provides for the possibility that diesel engine manufacturers may not be able to meet these standards exactly on that date  and allows companies to continue selling non compliant engines if they pay non conformance penalties ncps on those engines 
the company began shipping lower emission engines in october as a bridge until the fully compliant acert engines are introduced in these bridge engines require the payment of ncps 
emissions standard changes negatively impacted our financial results in  by million after tax cents per share 
we expect the net unfavorable impact in to be no more than the impact 
we do not anticipate having to pay any ncps on our medium duty engines in due to credits we banked in and early in  caterpillar will begin ramping up production of medium duty and heavy duty compliant acert engines 
we do not anticipate paying ncps beyond if these assumptions are not realized  company performance could be negatively impacted 
projected cost savings or synergies from alliances with new partners could also be negatively impacted by a variety of factors 
these factors could include  among other things  higher than expected wages  energy and or materials costs  and or higher than expected financing costs due to unforeseen changes in central bank interest rate policies 
cost savings could also be negatively impacted by unforeseen changes in tax  trade  environmental  labor  safety  payroll or pension policies in any of the jurisdictions where the alliances conduct their operations 
results may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in the sales mix 
our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales 
if actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales  our results could be negatively impacted 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the company s share of industry sales 
an unexpected reduction in that share could result from pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors  unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties  a failure to price the product competitively  or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer owned rental fleets  leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and or used equipment prices 
page the environment also remains very competitive from a pricing standpoint 
additional price discounting would result in lower than anticipated price realization 
inherent in the operation of the financial products division is the credit risk associated with its customers 
the creditworthiness of each customer  and the rate of delinquencies  repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors  including  but not limited to  relevant industry and economic conditions  the availability of capital  the experience and expertise of the customer s management team  commodity prices  political events  and the sustained value of the underlying collateral 
additionally  interest rate movements create a degree of risk to our operations by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed rate debt 
while our policy is to use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes and lower the costs of borrowed funds  if interest rates move upward more sharply than anticipated  it could negatively impact our results
