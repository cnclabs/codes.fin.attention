ebida is computed as income loss before minority interests and extraordinary items plus interest expense  depreciation and amortization  gains losses on disposal of properties and loss provisions 
we believe that in addition to net income and cash flows  ebida is a useful measure of the financial performance of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  ebida provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions  developments and other capital expenditures 
to evaluate ebida and the trends it depicts  the components of ebida  such as rental revenues  rental expenses  real estate taxes and general and administrative expenses  should be considered 
for a further discussion of ebida and its components  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
excluded from ebida are financing costs such as interest as well as depreciation and amortization  each of which can significantly affect a reits results of operations and liquidity and should be considered in evaluating a reit s operating performance 
further  ebida does not represent net income or cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and does not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient to fund all of our cash needs 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity

these projects are currently in three different phases of development approximately  square feet is substantially completed and in the stabilization phase   square feet in the predevelopment phase and  square feet in the entitlement phase 
the alliances grant us certain rights to purchase the properties upon completion of development 
as of december   we had invested approximately million in these alliances 
in addition  we have acquired properties from them aggregating approximately million since we have no further contractual obligations for the future funding of these developments  however  we will likely be funding a portion of their working capital needs until such time as other financing is obtained 
under these alliances  we have provided an aggregate of million in debt guarantees  however  some of the loans were not fully drawn as of december  these guarantees will remain in place until such time as the related development financing has been replaced or repaid  the terms of which vary from approximately to years 
we would be required to perform under these guarantees in the event that the proceeds generated by the sale  refinance or additional capital contribution by partners of the development project were insufficient to repay the full amount of the related debt financing 
there is currently no recorded liability for any amounts that may become payable under these guarantees  nor is there a liability for our obligation to stand ready to fund such guarantees 
in the event that we must make payments under one of these guarantees  our only recourse is to the limited liability companies that own the properties 
no estimate of the amount that could be recovered by us in such an event can be made at this time

in connection with the sale of multifamily properties in december  the repurchase authorization was increased to approximately million shares  representing approximately of common stock outstanding when the repurchase program began 
as of december    common shares have been repurchased for a total cost of approximately  this represents approximately of the expanded repurchase authorization and approximately of common stock outstanding when the repurchase program began 
in addition  during  we announced that our board of directors had approved the repurchase of up to of its preferred stock  or  shares 
in may  the preferred stock repurchase authorization was increased to  shares  representing approximately of preferred stock outstanding when the repurchase program began 
as of december    preferred shares have been repurchased for a total cost of approximately  this represents approximately of the expanded repurchase authorization and approximately of preferred stock outstanding when the repurchase program began 
future stock repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market or otherwise and the timing will depend on market conditions and other factors 
critical accounting policies revenue recognized on a straight line basis we recognize rental revenue on a straight line basis at amounts that we believe we will collect on a tenant by tenant basis 
the estimation process may result in higher or lower levels from period to period as our collection experience and the credit quality of our tenants changes 
actual amounts collected could be lower or higher than the amounts recognized on a straight line basis if specific tenants are unable to pay rent that we have previously recognized as revenue  or if other tenants remain whom we previously believed would not 
carrying value of rental properties  investments in development and other investment assets our rental properties  investments in development and other investment assets such as operating joint ventures and mortgage loans receivable are generally carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value 
certain development and operating joint ventures include our share of undistributed income or loss arising from the investment  and the mortgage loans receivable include accrued interest 
in addition  under our long term development program  some interest  payroll and general and administrative costs incurred in connection with this program may be capitalized 
the actual value of our portfolio of property  investments in development and other investments could be significantly higher or lower than their carrying amounts 
our status as a real estate investment trust reit we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under sections to of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
a real estate investment trust is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its real estate investment trust taxable income taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders  provided that at least of taxable income is distributed and other requirements are met 
we believe that we have complied with all requirements to qualify as a reit for the years ended december  and accordingly  no provision for income taxes is included in our consolidated financial statements

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities and supercedes emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  as defined by the statement 
under eitf  an exit cost was recognized at the date an entity committed to an exit plan 
additionally  sfas provides that exit and disposal costs should be measured at fair value and that the associated liability will be adjusted for changes in estimated cash flows 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december  in november  the fasb approved for issuance fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december  in january  the fasb approved for issuance fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  fin may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for all financial statements initially issued after january  it is possible that certain of the entities through which and with which we conduct business  including those described in notes and in item will be deemed to be variable interest entities under the provisions of fin the total assets and liabilities of such entities were approximately million and million at december  our maximum exposure to loss would be equal to our investments in these arrangements  plus the related debt guarantees  as described in note in item the disclosures provided reflect our understanding and analysis of fin based upon information currently available 
the evaluation of our various arrangements is ongoing and is subject to change in the event additional interpretive guidance is provided by the financial accounting standards board or others 
inflation leases at the office properties typically provide for rent adjustment and pass through of certain operating expenses during the term of the lease 
substantially all of the leases at the industrial and retail properties provide for pass through to tenants of certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance expenses  and insurance 
leases at the multifamily properties generally provide for an initial term of one month or one year and allow for rent adjustments at the time of renewal 
all of these provisions may permit us to increase rental rates or 
table of contents other charges to tenants in response to rising prices and therefore  serve to reduce our exposure to the adverse effects of inflation 
forward looking statements  factors that may affect operating results this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities and exchange act of  including statements regarding our expectations  hopes  intentions  beliefs and strategies regarding the future 
forward looking statements include statements regarding potential acquisitions  the anticipated performance of our properties and statements regarding our financing activities 
the forward looking statements in this annual report on form k are subject to additional risks and uncertainties further discussed under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation risk factors below  and are based on information available to us on the date hereof 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statement or statements 
actual results  performance or outcomes may differ materially from those stated or implied in such forward looking statements 
the reader should also consult the cautionary statements and risk factors listed from time to time in our reports on forms q  k and our k 
risk factors we have identified a number of risk factors  which could adversely affect our stock value  asset value  or cash flow available to pay debt service or dividends 
market fluctuations in rental rates and occupancy could adversely affect our operations our portfolio of leases turns over continuously  with the number and value of expiring leases varying from year to year 
our ability to re lease the space to existing or new tenants at rates equal to or greater than those realized historically is impacted by  among other things  the economic conditions of the market in which a property is located  the availability of competing space including sublease space offered by tenants who have vacated space in competing buildings prior to the expiration of their lease term  and the level of improvements which may be required at the property 
we cannot assure you that the rental rates we obtain in the future will be equal to or greater than those obtained under existing contractual commitments 
if we cannot lease all or substantially all of the expiring space at our properties promptly or if the rental rates are significantly lower than expected  then our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
tenants defaults could adversely affect our operations our ability to manage our assets is subject to federal bankruptcy laws and state laws that limit creditors rights and remedies available to real property owners to collect delinquent rents 
if a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt  we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor in possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to that tenant 
we also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises 
if a tenant becomes bankrupt  the federal bankruptcy code will apply  which in some instances may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant 
a tenant s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our cash flow may be insufficient for debt service requirements we intend to incur indebtedness in the future  including through borrowings under our credit facility  to finance property acquisitions  retirement of debt and stock repurchases 
as a result  we expect to be subject to the risks associated with debt financing including the risk that interest rates may increase  our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt  and we may be unable to refinance or repay the debt as it comes due 
debt restrictions may affect our operations and negatively affect our ability to repay indebtedness at maturity our current million unsecured credit facility contains provisions that restrict the amount of distributions we can make 
these provisions provide that distributions may not exceed of funds from operations for any fiscal quarter 
if we cannot obtain acceptable financing to repay indebtedness at maturity  we may have to sell properties to repay indebtedness or properties may be foreclosed upon  which could adversely affect our results of operations  
table of contents financial condition and ability to service debt 
also  as of december   approximately million of our total indebtedness included secured mortgages with cross collateralization provisions 
in the event of a default  the holders of this indebtedness may seek to foreclose upon properties which are not the primary collateral for their loan 
this may  in turn  accelerate other indebtedness secured by these properties 
foreclosure of properties would cause us to lose income and asset value 
fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our operations as of december   we had approximately million of variable interest rate indebtedness 
accordingly  an increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest payments we make to service the debt which would adversely affect our net income and results of operations 
acquisitions could adversely affect operations consistent with our strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisition opportunities 
from time to time we actively consider acquiring specific properties  which may include properties we manage or that are owned by affiliated parties 
it is possible that one or more of such possible future acquisitions  if completed  could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
potential adverse consequences of transactions involving conflicts of interest we have acquired  and from time to time may acquire  properties from partnerships that robert batinovich  our chairman and chief executive officer  and andrew batinovich  our president and chief operating officer  control  and in which they and members of their families have substantial interests 
these transactions involve or will involve conflicts of interest 
these transactions also may provide substantial economic benefits to those individuals such as payments or issuances of partnership units in the operating partnership  relief or deferral of tax liabilities  relief of primary or secondary liability for debt  and reduction in exposure to other property related liabilities 
our policy provides that interested directors may not vote with regard to transactions in which they have a substantial interest 
these transactions may only be completed if they are approved by a majority of the disinterested directors  with the interested directors abstaining 
despite this policy and the presence of appraisals or fairness opinions or review by parties who have no interest in the transactions  the transactions will not be the product of arm s length negotiation 
these transactions may not be as favorable to us as transactions that we negotiate with unrelated parties and they could result in undue benefit to robert and andrew batinovich and members of their families 
none of these parties has guaranteed that any properties acquired from entities they control or in which they have a significant interest will be as profitable as our other investments or will not result in losses 
dependence on executive officers we depend on the efforts of robert batinovich  our chief executive officer and andrew batinovich  our president and chief operating officer  and our other executive officers 
the loss of the services of any of them could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
both robert and andrew batinovich have entered into employment agreements with us 
potential liability due to environmental matters under federal  state and local laws relating to protection of the environment  or environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances on the property 
these owners may be required to investigate and clean up the contamination on the property as well as the contamination which has migrated from the property 
environmental laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the contamination 
this liability may be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility 
in addition  the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third parties based on personal injury  property damage and or other costs  including investigation and clean up costs  resulting from environmental contamination 
environmental laws may also impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or transferred or in which businesses may be operated 
these restrictions may require expenditures 
under the environmental laws  
table of contents any person who arranges for the transportation  disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of investigation or clean up of those substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person 
our tenants generally are required by their leases to operate in compliance with all applicable environmental laws  and to indemnify us against any environmental liability arising from their activities on the properties 
however  we could be subject to environmental liability relating to our management of the properties or strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest in the properties 
also tenants may not satisfy their indemnification obligations under the leases 
we are also subject to the risk that any environmental assessments of our properties  properties being considered for acquisition  or the properties owned by the partnerships managed by us may not have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  any prior owner or prior or current operator of these properties may have created an environmental condition not known to us  or an environmental condition may otherwise exist as to any one or more of these properties 
any one of these conditions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or ability to service debt  either directly with respect to its properties  or indirectly with respect to properties owned by partnerships we manage 
moreover  future environmental laws  ordinances or regulations may have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and ability to service debt 
also  the current environmental condition of those properties may be affected by tenants and occupants of the properties  by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the properties such as the presence of underground storage tanks  or by third parties unrelated to us 
environmental assessments and potential liability due to asbestos containing materials environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of asbestos containing building materials 
these laws require that asbestos containing building materials be properly managed and maintained and that those who may come into contact with asbestos containing building materials be adequately informed and trained 
they also require that special precautions  including removal or other abatement  be undertaken in the event asbestos containing building materials are disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
they also may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
all of the properties that we presently own have been subject to phase i environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants 
some of the phase i environmental assessments recommended further investigations in the form of phase ii environmental assessments  including soil and groundwater sampling 
we have completed all of these investigations or are in the process of completing them 
some of our properties have been found to contain asbestos containing building materials 
we believe that these materials have been adequately contained and we have implemented an asbestos containing building materials operations and maintenance program for the properties found to contain asbestos containing building materials 
some  but not all  of the properties owned by partnerships we manage have been subject to phase i environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants 
we determine on a case by case basis whether to obtain phase i environmental assessments on these properties and whether to undertake further investigation or remediation 
some of these properties contain asbestos containing building materials 
in each case  we believe that these materials have been adequately contained and we have implemented an asbestos containing building materials operations and maintenance program for the properties found to contain asbestos containing building materials 
potential environmental liability resulting from underground storage tanks some of our properties  as well as properties that we previously owned  are leased or have been leased to owners or operators of businesses that use  store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
these businesses include dry cleaners that operate on site dry cleaning plants and auto care centers 
some of these properties contain  or may have contained  underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances 
these operations create a potential for the release of those 
table of contents substances 
some of our properties are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
several of our properties have been contaminated with these substances from on site operations or operations on adjacent or nearby properties 
in addition  some properties are on  or are adjacent to or near other properties upon which others  including former owners or tenants of the properties  have engaged or may engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
environmental liabilities may adversely affect operating costs and ability to borrow the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws as well as the cost of complying with future legislation may affect our operating costs 
in addition  the presence of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances at any of our properties  or the failure to remediate those properties properly  may adversely affect our ability to borrow by using those properties as collateral 
the cost of defending against claims of liability and the cost of complying with environmental laws  including investigation or clean up of contaminated property  could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
general risks of ownership of real estate we are subject to risks generally incidental to the ownership of real estate 
these risks include changes in general economic or local conditions  changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties in an area  the impact of environmental protection laws  changes in interest rates and availability of financing which may render the sale or financing of a property difficult or unattractive  changes in tax  real estate and zoning laws  and the creation of mechanics liens or similar encumbrances placed on the property by a lessee or other parties without our knowledge and consent 
should any of these events occur  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
general risks associated with management and leasing contracts we are subject to the risks generally associated with the property management and leasing businesses 
these risks include the risk that management contracts or service agreements may be terminated  contracts will not be renewed upon expiration or will not be renewed on terms consistent with current terms  and leasing activity generally may decline 
uninsured losses may adversely affect operations we  or in certain instances  tenants of the properties  carry comprehensive liability  fire and extended coverage with respect to the properties 
this coverage has policy specification and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties 
however  certain types of losses such as from earthquakes and floods may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
further  certain of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity and floods 
should a property sustain damage as a result of an earthquake or flood  we may incur losses due to insurance deductibles  co payments on insured losses or uninsured losses 
in addition  although our existing policies of insurance covering property damage do not exclude coverage for acts of terrorism  it is possible that such an exclusion could be imposed by an insurance carrier either during the current policy term upon satisfaction of certain notice requirements  or upon future policy renewal  in which case any losses from acts of terrorism might be uninsured 
should an uninsured loss occur  we could lose some or all of our capital investment  cash flow and anticipated profits related to one or more properties 
this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
illiquidity of real estate may limit our ability to vary our portfolio real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  will tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio quickly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and individual agreements with sellers of properties limit our ability to sell properties 

table of contents twenty five of our properties were acquired on terms and conditions under which they can be disposed of only in a like kind exchange or other non taxable transaction for limited periods of time 
the agreed upon time periods for these restrictions on dispositions vary from transaction to transaction 
potential liability under the americans with disabilities act all of our properties are required to be in compliance with the americans with disabilities act 
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that places of public accommodation be made accessible to people with disabilities to the extent readily achievable 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act requirements could require removal of access barriers 
non compliance could result in imposition of fines by the federal government  an award of damages to private litigants and or a court order to remove access barriers 
because of the limited history of the americans with disabilities act  the impact of its application to our properties  including the extent and timing of required renovations  is uncertain 
pursuant to lease agreements with tenants in certain of the single tenant properties  the tenants are obligated to comply with the americans with disabilities act provisions 
if our costs are greater than anticipated or tenants are unable to meet their obligations  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
development alliances may adversely affect operations we may  from time to time  enter into alliances with selected developers for the purpose of developing new projects in which these developers have  in the opinion of management  significant expertise or experience 
these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals  the receipt of which cannot be assured 
these development activities also may entail certain risks  including the risk that management may expend funds on and devote time to projects which may not come to fruition  construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates  possibly making the project uneconomical  occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated  and expenses at a completed development may be higher than anticipated 
in addition  the partners in development alliances may have significant control over the operation of the alliance project 
therefore  these investments may  under certain circumstances  involve risks such as the possibility that the partner might become bankrupt  have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interest or goals  or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives 
consequently  actions by a partner in a development alliance might subject property owned by the alliance to additional risk 
although we will seek to maintain sufficient control of any alliance to permit our objectives to be achieved  we may be unable to take action without the approval of our development alliance partners 
conversely  our development alliance partners could take actions binding on the alliance without our consent 
in addition  should a partner in a development alliance become bankrupt  we could become liable for the partner s share of the project s liabilities 
these risks may result in a development project adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
material tax risks since  we have operated as a reit under the code 
however  we may not be able to maintain our status as a reit 
to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions 
only limited judicial or administrative interpretation exists for these provisions and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
we receive nonqualifying management fee income and  as a result  we may approach the income test limits imposed by the code 
there is a risk that we may not satisfy these tests 
we are relying on the opinion of our tax counsel regarding our ability to qualify as a reit 
this legal opinion  however  is not binding on the internal revenue service  or irs 

table of contents consequences of failure to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates 
in addition  we also may be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify 
this would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability 
in addition  we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders 
even if we continue to qualify as a reit  we will be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
possible changes in tax laws  effect on the market value of real estate investments income tax treatment of reits may be modified by legislative  judicial or administrative action at any time 
these changes may be applied to past as well as future operations 
legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to the qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 
in addition  the changes might also indirectly affect the market value of all real estate investments  and consequently our ability to realize our investment objectives 
our indebtedness restrictions may adversely affect our ability to incur indebtedness our organizational documents limit our ability to incur additional debt if the total debt  including the additional debt  would exceed of the borrowing base 
this could limit the company s ability to incur debt to fund new acquisitions  capital improvements to existing properties  or dividends 
this debt limitation in our charter can only be amended by an affirmative vote of the majority of all outstanding stock entitled to vote on such amendment 
the term borrowing base is defined as the greater of fair market value or total market capitalization 
fair market value is based upon the value of our assets as determined by an independent appraiser 
total market capitalization is the sum of the market value of our outstanding capital stock  including shares issuable on exercise of redemption options by holders of units of the limited partnership  plus debt 
an exception is made for refinancings and borrowings required to make distributions to maintain our status as a reit 
in light of these debt restrictions  it should be noted that a change in the value of our common stock could affect the borrowing base  and therefore our ability to incur additional indebtedness  even though such change in the common stock s value is unrelated to our liquidity 
limitation on ownership of common stock and stockholder s rights plan may preclude acquisition of control provisions of our charter are designed to assist us in maintaining our qualification as a reit under the code by preventing concentrated ownership in our common and preferred stock which might jeopardize our reit qualification 
among other things  these provisions provide that any transfer or acquisition of our common or preferred stock that would result in our disqualification as a reit under the code will be void  and if any person attempts to acquire shares of our common or preferred stock that after the acquisition would cause the person to own an amount of common stock and preferred stock in excess of a predetermined limit  such acquisitions would be void 
ownership is determined by operation of certain attribution rules set out in the code 
pursuant to board action  the limit currently is of the value of the outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock 
we refer to this limitation as the ownership limitation 
the common stock or preferred stock the transfer of which would cause any person to violate the ownership limitation  is referred to as the excess shares 
a transfer that would violate the ownership limitation will be void and the common stock or preferred stock subject to the transfer will automatically be transferred to an unaffiliated trustee for the benefit of a charitable organization designated by the board of directors until sold by the trustee to a third party or purchased by us 
this limitation on the ownership of common stock and preferred stock may preclude the acquisition of control of us by a third party without the consent of the board of directors 
if the board of directors waives the ownership limitation for any person  the ownership limitation will be proportionally and automatically reduced with regard to all other persons such that no five persons may own more than of the value of the common stock and preferred stock 
certain other provisions contained in our charter and bylaws may also have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an 
table of contents acquisition proposal and may thereby inhibit a change in control of us even if a change in control would be in the best interests of the stockholders 
in addition  in july  the board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under the plan  we declared a dividend of rights on our common stock 
the rights issued under the plan will be triggered  with certain exceptions  if and when any person or group acquires  or commences a tender offer to acquire  or more of our shares 
the rights plan is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquirer to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with the board of directors 
however  it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of us  even if a majority of our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition  and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of us or to change existing management 
risks of litigation certain claims and lawsuits have arisen against us in our normal course of business 
we believe that such claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flow or results of operations 
uncertainty due to the board of directors ability to change investment policies the board of directors may change our investment policies without a vote of the stockholders 
if our investment policies change  the risks and potential rewards of an investment in the shares may also change 
in addition  the methods of implementing our investment policies may vary as new investment techniques are developed 
effect of market interest rates on price of common stock the annual yield on the price paid for shares of our common stock from our distributions may influence the market price of the shares of our common stock in public markets 
an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to seek a higher annual yield from their investments 
this may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
shares available for future sale we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of shares of our common stock or future conversions or exercises of securities for future sales will have on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perception that substantial sales could occur  may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative information about market risk interest rates we are exposed to changes in interest rates obtainable on our secured and unsecured borrowings 
we do not believe that changes in market interest rates will have a material impact on the performance or fair value of our mortgage loan receivable 
it is our policy to manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for our borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
in order to maximize financial flexibility when selling properties and minimize potential prepayment penalties on fixed rate loans  we have also entered into several variable rate debt arrangements 
approximately at december  and at december  of our outstanding debt  including amounts borrowed under the credit facility  were subject to variable rates 
in addition  the average interest rate on our debt decreased from at december  to at december  we review interest rate exposure in the portfolio continually in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
we do not have any other material market sensitive financial instruments 
it is not our policy to engage in hedging activities for speculative or trading purposes 
we may enter into forward interest rate  or similar  agreements to hedge specific anticipated debt issuances where we believe the risk of adverse changes in market rates is significant 
under a forward interest rate agreement  if the referenced interest rate increases  we are entitled to a receipt in settlement of the agreement that economically would offset the higher financing cost of the debt issued 
if the referenced interest rate decreases  we make payment in settlement of the agreement  creating an expense that economically would offset the reduced financing cost of the debt issued 
at december   we were not a party to any forward interest rate or similar agreements other than the interest rate cap contract entered into in december as discussed above 

table of contents the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on rates in effect at the reporting date 
expected maturity date thereafter total fair value in thousands secured fixed average interest rate secured variable average interest rate unsecured variable average interest rate we believe that the interest rates given in the table for fixed rate borrowings approximate the rates we could currently obtain for instruments of similar terms and maturities and that the fair values of these instruments approximate carrying value at december  a change of in the index rate to which our variable rate debt is tied would change the annual interest we incurred by  based upon the balances outstanding on variable rate instruments at december
