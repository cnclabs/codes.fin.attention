as discussed below in the critical accounting policies section  amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the third party payors 
see that critical accounting policies sections for discussion of the effects that this revenue concentration and the uncertainties related to such revenues have on our revenue recognition policies 
compared to results for include a increase compared to in net revenues and a increase in net income before income taxes 
as shown in the above tables  patient revenues for nhc increased in compared to the increases in net patient revenues are primarily due to improved medicare  medicaid and private pay rates and improved census mix 
increases have been off set in part by medicare cuts which were implemented october  these medicare cuts reduced our revenues by approximately million in our fourth quarter 
see october  medicare rate costs below 
also included in other revenues  we recognized million of rent income million in and million of accounting and financial service income million in from the florida centers that were divested on october  see divestiture of florida operations below 
revenues from management or accounting and financial services  which are included in the consolidated statements of income in other revenues  increased million or in from million in to million in the increase is due primarily to the recognition of million  including million from national  of management fees and accounting and financial fees which were received in but which were doubtful of collection in the prior year 
during  nhc provided management and financial and accounting services for facilities as compared to facilities during total costs and expenses for increased million or to million from million 
salaries  wages and benefits  the largest operating costs of this service company  increased million or to million from million 
other operating expenses increased million or to  for compared to million in rent increased 
million or 
to 
million 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million 
interest costs decreased to million 
increases in salaries  wages and benefits are due primarily to increased bonus and benefit programs compared to the increases result both from inflationary increases and from changes in the benefit programs 
the increases are offset in part due to prior year expenses totaling million for a bonus program 
increases in other operating costs and expenses are due primarily to inflationary increases and higher occupancies in assisted living and independent living services and approximately  of project development costs not considered to be recoverable in future periods 
interest expense decreased due to lower interest rates on variable rate debt and debt retirement 
the weighted average interest rate decreased to in from in expenses this year included a loss for the writedown of a first mortgage note receivable 
during  we recorded a writedown in the amount of  of a first mortgage note receivable 
the note is secured by a bed long term health care facility located in tennessee which we manage 
the facility has experienced a lack of increase in reimbursement rates  diminished cash flows and has not made a principal payment since january of during the third quarter of  we have prepared revised projections based on the new reimbursement rates effective october  based on an analysis consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  we concluded that  based on the projected expected cash flows from the revised budgets and the inability to obtain refinancing  a writedown of  was required 
expenses this year also included a loss of  for the write off of a note receivable 
this note receivable is due from a bed long term health care center in missouri that we manage 
the write off was recorded during the first quarter of as a result of the lack of increase in reimbursement rates  the cash flows of this center declined and the center had not made a principal payment on this note since december  based on an analysis consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  we concluded that the write off of  was required 
we continue to monitor closely our other notes receivable from centers to which we provide management or accounting services 
the tax provision remained constant at approximately of income before income taxes 
october  medicare rate cuts medicare payments to skilled nursing facilities snf s were cut by approximately to effective october  the cuts occurred because of the expiration of two temporary add on payments to snf s 
the balanced budget refinement act passed in included a temporary four percent across the board increase in snf payments for rug rates 
the benefits improvement and protection act passed in temporarily raised the nursing case mix component of the rugs by percent 
both of these add on payments expired on october  these snf payment cuts reduced our medicare revenues by approximately million in the fourth quarter of and are expected to reduce revenues by million in these snf medicare cuts will also reduce the revenues of the centers which we manage 
our fees to these centers are generally calculated as a percentage of revenues 
the cuts will reduce both the current amounts owed for management fees and the cash available to the centers to pay unpaid management fees from prior years 
our management fee revenues are reported as other revenues on the statements of income 
regarding medicare payments for home health care services  the centers for medicare and medicaid services announced that effective october   homecare payment rates have been decreased by seven percent from current rates and that the inflation update scheduled at percent will be reduced to a percent increase 
the changes resulted in an overall reduction of percent in payment rates from current payment rates for home health care services effective october  including these and other additional medicare changes  our revenues for homecare services were reduced by approximately million for the fourth quarter of and are expected to reduce revenues by million in compared to divestiture of florida operations because professional liability insurance in the state of florida was not available  effective october   we ceased all long term health care operations in florida 
prior to october   we had owned and operated two long term health care centers in florida 
in addition  we had leased from nhi and nhr ten long term health care centers and three assisted living centers in florida 
effective october   we leased our two owned long term health care centers to a group of non nhc affiliated companies 
furthermore  the individual nhr and nhi leases were terminated effective october   and the centers were leased to new tenants unrelated to us 
however  we are still the primary obligor because the properties were originally leased to us pursuant to a master lease 
lease payments received by nhi and nhr from the new leases offset our lease obligations pursuant to the master operating lease 
all such payments through december  have been received by nhi and nhr 
we also sold the current assets and current liabilities of our owned and leased florida facilities to the non nhc affiliated group of companies in exchange for total notes receivable of approximately million 
the notes have now been paid in full 
we additionally leased to the same group of companies our two owned long term care centers in florida and the furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements of the florida properties previously leased from nhi and nhr 
finally  we initially entered into agreements to provide certain working capital loans to the non nhc affiliated group of companies up to a maximum of  per bed per center 
no draws were ever made on the working capital loans and the notes and any obligations thereunder have now been canceled 
at december  substantially all required payments have been received from these florida centers 
although we do not provide any health care related management services for the two owned centers or the thirteen leased centers  we are providing accounting and financial services for these centers 
we report rent income on our leased property and equipment and income from accounting and financial services only when cash is received for these centers 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of rent income and million of accounting and financial service income from these centers 
we reported no similar income from these centers during the period from october  through december  also effective october   we ceased all health care management services to another ten florida long term health care centers 
we continue to provide accounting and financial services to certain of these centers owned by others and previously managed by us 
results results for reflect a decrease in net revenues and a increase in income before income tax 
the decrease in revenues is primarily due to the october  divestiture of long term care centers and three assisted living centers in florida 
if the operations of the divested assets and certain nonrecurring items are excluded from prior year results  revenues in increased by or million 
excluding the effect of the october  divestiture  revenues at existing centers were increased primarily due to improved medicare  medicaid and private pay rates 
also  revenues include recurring management fees and equipment lease payments of million from the centers which were divested on october   which comparable amounts were not included in revenues in the prior year 
revenues from management or accounting and financial services fees  which are included in the statement of income in other revenues  decreased million or in from million in to million in the decrease is primarily due to the receipt of million of previously unaccrued management fee revenue from national health corporation in the decrease is partially offset by the recognition of management fees and accounting and financial service fees which were received in but which were not being earned in including the million of fees from florida centers discussed above 
total costs and expenses for decreased million or to million from million 
the decrease in cost and expenses is primarily due to the october  divestiture of twelve long term care centers and three assisted living centers in florida 
if the operations of the divested assets are excluded from prior year results  total costs and expenses increased million or 
excluding the effect of october  divestitures  salaries  wages and benefits  the largest operating costs of this service company  increased million or to million from million 
again  excluding the effect of the october  divestitures  other operating expenses increased million or to million for compared to million in excluding the effect of october  divestitures  rent increased million or to million from million 
excluding adjustments related to the florida divestitures  depreciation and amortization remained unchanged in compared to interest costs decreased million to million 
the increase in salaries  wages and benefits is due in part to increased bonus and benefit programs in the increases result both from inflationary increases and from changes in benefit programs 
during and  we awarded million and million of bonuses to employees with existing employee notes payable to us 
bonuses accrued for administrators and directors of nursing increased due to success in attaining performance goals 
increases in other operating costs and expenses are due to inflationary increases and to write offs of certain developmental costs related to projects that are no longer being considered 
rent increases excluding the effect of the october  divestitures are due to additions at existing rental properties and to annual rent increases related to revenue inflators in our rental contracts 
interest expense decreased due to a decrease in interest rates on variable rate debt and due to principal payments on debt 
tax provisions remain constant at approximately of income before income taxes 
the total census at owned  leased and debt guaranteed managed centers for averaged compared to an average of for liquidity  capital resources and financial condition net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million provided by operating activities for the comparable period in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased from the comparable period in primarily as a result of the increases in net income  increased non cash charges and the changes in working capital 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million used in investing activities for the year ended december  cash used for the purchase of property and equipment was million for the year ended december  and million in the comparable period in cash invested in notes receivable  net of collections of notes receivable  was million net cash collections in compared to net collections in notes receivable in of million 
cash provided from the sale of marketable securities was million in compared to cash used to purchase securities of million in net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million net cash provided by financing activities in in the period  we received proceeds from debt issuance of 
million compared to million in the prior year 
payments on debt were million in compared to million in increases in cash held by trustees totaled million compared to million in the prior year 
collections of receivables for shareowners totaled million compared to  in in  construction at one continuing care community where we added units to our existing unit retirement center was completed 
we have begun construction of a bed long term care center in tennessee 
construction costs are being funded out of our working capital 
our contractual cash obligations for periods subsequent to december  are as follows less than total year years years after years in thousands long term debt      obligation to purchase senior secured notes from financial institutions   operating leases     total contractual cash obligations      we have guaranteed debt obligations of certain other entities totaling approximately  these guarantees are not included in the table above due to uncertainty about the amount or timing of our obligations under our commitments 
we do not anticipate material obligations under these commitments our current cash on hand  marketable securities  short term notes receivable  operating cash flows  and as needed  our borrowing capacity are expected to be adequate to finance our operating requirements and growth and development plans for and into our charter authorizes the payment of dividends at the discretion of the board of directors  however  at present  we do not anticipate paying dividends 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their three to five most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that our following accounting policies fit this definition revenue recognition third party payors approximately   and of our net revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the third party payors 
in our opinion  adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews 
any differences between our estimates of settlements and final determinations are reflected in operations in the year finalized 
for the cost report years and  we have submitted various requests for exceptions to medicare routine cost limitations for reimbursement 
we have received preliminary approval on  of these requests 
we have  in addition  made provisions of approximately  for other various medicare and medicaid issues for current and prior years 
consistent with our revenue recognition policies  we will record revenues associated with the approved requests and the other various issues when the approvals  including the final cost report audits  are assured 
although still subject to audit and review  approximately  of the routine cost limit exceptions and provisions will be recorded as revenues in if no further adjustments by the third party payors are made 
the amounts to be recorded during if no further adjustments are made by the third party payors are not significant 
pursuant to our settlement of outstanding litigation styled braeuning  et al vs 
national healthcare lp  et al  we entered into a note payable to the federal government 
the and routine cost limitation exception amounts which were approved by third party intermediaries during were reflected by the federal government as a direct reduction in the note payable 
we paid the note payable to the government in full during accrued risk reserves our accrued insurance risk reserves primarily represent the accrual for self insured risks associated with employee health insurance  workers compensation and professional and general liability claims 
the accrued risk reserves include a liability for reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims 
our policy with respect to a significant portion of our workers compensation and professional and general liability claims is to use an actuary to support the estimates recorded for incurred but unreported claims 
our health insurance reserve is based on our known claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but unreported claims determined by our analysis of historical claims paid 
we reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarterly basis 
professional liability is an area of particular concern to us 
the entire long term care industry has seen a dramatic increase in personal injury wrongful death claims based on alleged negligence by nursing homes and their employees in providing care to residents 
as of december   we and or our managed centers are defendants in such claims inclusive of years through this litigation is expected to take several years to complete and additional claims which are as yet unasserted may arise 
it is possible that these claims plus unasserted claims could exceed our insurance coverage and our reserves  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
during the fiscal year  we maintained insurance coverage for incidents occurring in all providers owned  leased or managed by us 
the coverages include both primary policies and umbrella policies 
for years through  the policies contain a per incident deductible 
for  we maintain an insurance policy through a captive insurance company with coverage limits of million per occurrence  million per building and million in the aggregate 
revenue recognition uncertain collections we provide management services to certain long term care facilities and to others we provide accounting and financial services 
we generally charge of net revenues for our management services and a predetermined fixed rate per bed for the accounting and financial services 
generally our policy is to recognize revenues associated with both management services and accounting and financial services on an accrual basis as the services are provided 
however  there are certain of the third parties with which we have contracted to provide services and which we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that the service revenue is not realizable and our policy is to recognize income only in the period in which the amounts are collected 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
certain of our accounts receivable from private paying patients and certain of our notes receivable are subject to credit losses 
we have attempted to reserve for expected accounts receivable credit losses based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable and believe our reserves to be adequate 
we continually monitor and evaluate the carrying amount of our notes receivable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and it is possible  however  that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of the receivables changes over time 
we continually review and refine our estimation process to make it as reactive to these changes as possible 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accurately estimate credit losses on these balances 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
revenue recognition mortgage interest we collect interest from long term care centers from which we have mortgage or other notes receivable 
generally our policy is to recognize interest revenues on an accrual basis as earned 
however  there are certain centers for which we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that revenue for interest is not realizable 
for these nonperforming investments  our policy is to recognize interest revenue only in the period in which the amounts are collected 
this policy could cause revenues to vary significantly from period to period 
potential recognition of deferred income during  we sold the assets of eight long term health care centers to national  our administrative general partner at the time of the sale 
the resulting profit of  was deferred and will be amortized into income beginning with the collection of the note receivable up to  with the balance  of the profit being amortized into income on a straight line basis over the management contract period 
the collection or alternatively  the offset against certain payables to national of up to  of notes receivable would result in the immediate recognition of up to  of pretax net income 
tax contingencies nhc continually evaluates for tax related contingencies 
contingencies may arise where tax laws may allow for alternative interpretations or where the timing of recognition of income is subject to judgment 
we believe we have adequate provisions for tax contingencies 
however  because of uncertainty of interpretation by various tax authorities and the possibility that there are issues that have not been recognized by management  we cannot guarantee we have accurately estimated our tax liabilities 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
guarantees and related third party exposure debt guarantees in addition to our primary debt obligations  which are included in our consolidated financial statements  we have guaranteed the debt obligations of certain other entities 
those guarantees  which are not included as debt obligations in our consolidated financial statements  total  at december  and include  of debt of managed and other long term health care centers and  of debt of national and the esop 
the  of guarantees of debt of managed and other long term health care centers relates to first mortgage debt obligations of five long term health care centers to which we provide management or accounting services 
we have agreed to guarantee these obligations in order to obtain management agreements 
for this service  we charge an annual guarantee fee of to of the outstanding principal balance guaranteed  which fee is in addition to our management fee 
all of this guaranteed indebtedness is secured by first mortgages  pledges of personal property  accounts receivable  marketable securities and  in certain instances  the personal guarantees of the owners of the facilities 
the  of guarantees of debt of national and the esop relates to senior secured notes held by financial institutions 
the total outstanding balance of national and the esop s obligations under these senior secured notes is  of this obligation   has been included in our debt obligations because we are a direct obligor on this indebtedness 
the remaining  which is not included in our debt obligations because we are not a direct obligor  is due from nhi to national and the esop 
additionally  under the amended terms of these note agreements  the lending institutions have the right to put to us the entire outstanding balance of this debt on march  upon exercise of this put option by the lending institutions  we would be obligated to purchase the then outstanding balance of these senior secured notes  which is estimated to be approximately  debt cross defaults the  senior secured notes and the  senior notes were borrowed from national 
national obtained its financing through the esop 
as we are a direct obligor on this debt  it has been reported as a liability owed by us to the holders of the debt instruments rather than as a liability owed to national and the esop 
through a guarantee agreement  our  senior secured notes and our  guarantee described above  and the  senior notes have cross default provisions with other debt of national and the esop 
we currently believe that national and the esop are in compliance with the terms of their debt agreements 
new accounting pronouncements from june through june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas and various amendments and interpretations 
sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that any derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at our estimated fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s estimated fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
nhc adopted sfas  as amended  effective january  our investments in marketable securities include an investment in nhi debt securities convertible into nhi common stock 
sfas requires that we account for the nhi debt securities as two separate instruments a purchased call option on the issuer s stock and a nonconvertible interest bearing debt security 
because we are not using the purchased call option as a hedging instrument  sfas requires that we report changes in the fair value of the separated call options currently in earnings 
in addition  we are required to accrete the resulting discount on the nonconvertible debt security into income over the remaining term of the nonconvertible debt security 
at december   the fair value of the purchased call option  as determined using an option pricing model  was approximately  the change in the fair value of the purchased call option resulted in an increase to other revenues and pretax net income of  between january  and november   at which time the debt security was converted into common stock of the issuing company 
the common stock received in connection with the conversion is recorded as available for sale marketable securities at december  in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 business combinations and requires all business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in addition  sfas requires that identifiable intangible assets be recognized apart from goodwill based on meeting certain criteria 
sfas supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 intangible assets and addresses how intangible assets and goodwill should be accounted for upon and after acquisition 
specifically  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment tests based on their estimated fair value 
we have adopted sfas and effective january  the adoption of sfas and resulted in the cessation of goodwill amortization of approximately  per year 
during august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and supersedes certain existing accounting literature  which literature we currently use to evaluate the recoverability of our real estate properties 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas effective january  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
impact of inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years 
in addition  historical reimbursement rates under the medicare and medicaid programs generally have reflected the underlying increases in health care costs and expenses resulting from inflation 
for these reasons  the impact of inflation on profitability has historically not been significant 
however  our health care centers began the three year phase in of the new prospective payment system under the medicare program effective during rates paid under pps do not necessarily reflect all inflationary changes and are subject to cuts unrelated to inflationary costs 
therefore  there can be no assurance that future rate increases will be sufficient to offset future inflation increases in our labor and other health care service costs 
health care legislation during  the federal government enacted the balanced budget act of bba  which requires that skilled nursing facilities transition to a prospective payment system pps under the medicare program commencing with the first cost reporting period beginning on or after july  pps has significantly changed the manner in which our centers are paid for inpatient services provided to medicare beneficiaries 
under pps  medicare pays our centers a fixed fee per medicare patient per day  based on the acuity level of the patient  to cover all post hospital extended care routine service costs  ancillary costs and capital related costs 
the bba produced a crisis in long term care funding throughout the country 
congress addressed this financial distress in the fall of through enactment of the balanced budget refinement act bbra 
in  congress adjusted further the payment rates to skilled nursing facilities under the benefits improvement and protection act bipa 
the bbra included a percent across the board increase in payments to skilled nursing facilities for fiscal years and and a temporary percent increase to resource utilization groups rugs for patients considered medically complex 
these changes went into effect on october  the bipa increased the inflation update to the full market basket in fiscal year and raised the nursing component of the rugs by percent in an effort to improve pps nursing staff ratios 
additionally  the bipa spread the bbra percent increase to the three rehabilitation rugs across all special rehabilitation rugs as a percent increase 
the other rugs changed in the bbra maintained the percent increase 
these changes went into effect on april  the improvements brought about by bbra and bipa including the percent across the board increase in rug payments  the percent increase in nursing component  the changes in the snf market basket  and the percent rugs add ons expired on september  the resultant reduction in pps payment rates reduced our revenues by approximately  in the fourth quarter of and are expected to reduce revenues by approximately  in regarding medicare payments for home health care services  the centers for medicare and medicaid services announced that effective october   homecare payment rates have been reduced 
the homecare rate reductions reduced our revenues by approximately million for the fourth quarter of and are expected to reduce our revenues by million in we  along with our entire industry  are actively working to remind congress and the administration of the necessity of the continuation of the bbra and bipa 
nursing homes and home health agencies have recently been the target of health care reform  from both fraud and reimbursement perspectives 
operation restore trust  a demonstration project which has been conducted by the department of health and human services in five states  is expanding to a dozen more states 
ort plus will continue its focus on fraud in the areas of home health  nursing home and dme suppliers  as well as adding new anti fraud and abuse targets 
we will operate nursing homes and home health agencies in five ort plus states and could be subject to increased scrutiny 
although our management believes that our home care and nursing home operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that the company and our home care and nursing home operations will not be the subject of an investigation nor that they will be found to be in compliance if investigated 
see item legal proceedings 
litigation braeuning vs 
nhc we were a defendant in a lawsuit styled braeuning  et al 
vs 
national healthcare lp  et al 
filed on april  and settled in december  the suit alleged that we submitted cost reports and routine cost limit exception requests containing fraudulent allocation of routine nursing services to ancillary service cost centers and also alleged that we improperly allocated skilled nursing service hours in four managed centers  all in the state of florida 
in our defense of the matter  we asserted that the cost report information of the centers was either appropriately filed or  upon self audit amendment  reflects adjustments for  among other items  i correction of unintentional misallocations  ii instances in which the self audit process has had to use different source documents due to loss or misplacement of the original source documents  and iii recalculation of certain nursing time based upon indirect allocation percentages rather than time studies  as were originally used 
the cost report periods covered by the suit included through a number of amended cost reports were filed and nhc finalized the self audit process for the years and we  the department of justice and the health care financing administration settled the suit by written agreement approved by the court on december  pursuant to that agreement  and based upon the self audit adjustments as negotiated by the parties  we agreed to a repayment totaling  payable over five years at interest  with no interest for the initial six months 
no fines or penalties of any nature are included within this amount 
the government also agreed to credit all and routine cost limit exception cost report settlements owed by it to us and or our managed centers against the settlement amount upon finalization of those cost reports 
as a result of the approval and payment on the and cost reports and certain cash payments  the repayment obligation was extinguished by the last quarter of in accordance with our revenue recognition policies  we will record the revenues associated with the approved routine cost limit exception cost report settlements when such approvals  including the final cost report audits  are assured 
general liability lawsuits the entire long term care industry has seen a dramatic increase in personal injury wrongful death claims based on alleged negligence by nursing homes and their employees in providing care to residents 
as of december   we and or our managed centers are currently defendants in such claims covering the years through fifty five of these suits are in florida  where we have not operated or managed long term care providers since september  when bids were solicited for third party liability coverage for  we were not totally surprised to find only two companies would quote coverage 
both quotations were so onerous and expensive that we elected to pay the quoted premium into a self funded captive insurance company 
thus  during  insurance coverage for incidents occurring at all providers owned or leased  and most providers managed by us  is maintained through this cayman island captive insurance company which is qualified and taxed as a domestic nhc subsidiary 
the coverages for all years include both primary policies and umbrella policies 
for years through forward  the policies contain a per incident deductible 
in and  there is no aggregate limit on our potential deductible obligations 
in  the deductibles were eliminated and first dollar coverage is provided through the captive insurance company 
we use independent actuaries to estimate our exposures for claims obligations for both asserted and unasserted claims related to deductibles and exposures in excess of coverage limits  and we maintain reserves for these obligations 
it is possible that claims against us could exceed our coverage limits and our reserves  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months 
as a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have minimal impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
approximately million of our notes receivable bear interest at fixed interest rates 
as the interest rates on these notes receivable are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
approximately million of our notes receivable bear interest at variable rates generally at prime plus 
because the interest rates of these instruments are variable  a hypothetical change in interest rates would result in a related increase or decrease in interest income of approximately  as of december   million of our long term debt and debt serviced by other parties bear interest at fixed interest rates 
because the interest rates of these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
the remaining million of our long term debt and debt serviced by other parties bear interest at variable rates 
because the interest rates of these instruments are variable  a hypothetical change in interest rates would result in a related increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately  we do not currently use any derivative instruments to hedge our interest rate exposure 
we have not used derivative instruments for trading purposes and the use of such instruments in the future would be subject to strict approvals by our senior officers 
therefore  our exposure related to such derivative instruments is not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
equity price risk we consider the majority of our investments in marketable securities as available for sale securities and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in stockholders equity in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the investments in marketable securities are recorded at their fair market value based on quoted market prices 
thus  there is exposure to equity price risk  which is the potential change in fair value due to a change in quoted market prices 
hypothetically  a change in quoted market prices would result in a related change in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities
