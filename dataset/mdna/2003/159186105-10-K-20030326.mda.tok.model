item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a designer and manufacturer of telecommunications equipment supplied to telephone and catv network providers worldwide 
in addition to company manufactured products  the company markets complementary products manufactured by third parties 
the company sells products directly to catv operators and telephone companies throughout the united states  canada  australia  united kingdom and certain other international markets  principally within developed nations 
the company believes that many of its customers periodically review their supply relationships and consequently the company can experience significant changes in buying patterns from specific customers between fiscal periods 
the company has historically operated with a relatively small backlog with sales and operating results in any quarter principally dependent upon orders booked and products shipped in that quarter 
the company s customers generally do not enter into long term supply contracts providing for future purchase commitments for the company s products 
these factors  when combined with the company s operating leverage and the need to incur certain capital expenditures and expenses in part based upon the expectation of future sales  causes the company s operating results to be at risk to changing customer buying patterns 
if sales levels in a particular period do not meet the company s expectations  operating results for that period may be materially and adversely affected 
the company uses numerous raw materials in its manufacturing processes 
although management believes that the company has adequate sources of supply for such raw materials  increases in the market prices of the company s raw materials could significantly increase the company s cost of goods sold and materially adversely affect the company s profitability 
the company s profitability may also be materially and adversely affected by decreases in its sales volume because many of the costs associated with the company s facilities  product development  engineering  tooling and other manufacturing processes are essentially fixed in nature and must be spread over its sales base in order to maintain historical levels of profitability 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates  as appropriate  when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events  it is at least reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates and assumptions that management believes have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are allowances for doubtful accounts allowances for excess and obsolete inventory valuation of goodwill and long lived assets restructuring costs accounting for income taxes 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on management s evaluation of the ability of customers to make payments  focusing on current economic conditions  customer financial conditions  historical payment experience and aging of receivable balances 
an adverse change in financial condition of a significant customer or group of customers could materially affect management s estimates related to doubtful accounts 
allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
the estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are based on management s assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including historical sales and usage of items in inventory  current levels of orders and backlog  forecasted demand  product life cycle and market conditions 
management does not believe the company s products are subject to a significant risk of obsolescence in the short term and management believes it has the ability to adjust production levels in response to declining demand 
however  if actual market conditions become less favorable than anticipated by management  additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required 
in the event management adjusts estimates such as forecasted sales or expected product lifecycles  the value of the company s inventory may become under or overstated and recognition of such under or overstatement will affect cost of sales in a future period  which could materially affect the company s operating results and financial position 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets 
management reviews goodwill and long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
management assesses potential impairment of the carrying values of these assets based on market prices  if available  and or assumptions about and estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated from these assets 
future cash flows may be adversely impacted by operating performance  market conditions and other factors 
an impairment charge would be based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is estimated by management based on market prices  if available  and or forecasted discounted cash flows  using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
assumptions related to future cash flows and discount rates involve management judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
if future cash flows  discount rates and other assumptions used in the assessment and measurement of impairment differ from management s estimates and forecasts  additional impairment charges could be required 
restructuring costs 
restructuring costs are recorded in accordance with fasb statement  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
one time severance benefits for employees terminated are recorded at the time management commits to the plan to reduce the work force  knows the amount of the termination benefit  is unlikely to change the plan and has communicated to employees the intended work force reduction 
liabilities for costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without an economic benefit  such as for facility lease payments for premises vacated  are recorded when the company ceases to use the right conveyed by the contract 
in the case of vacated leased facilities  the liability is based on the future lease payments required under the contract less the estimated future rental income the company may earn by subletting the facilities 
these estimates of future sublet income are based on current economic conditions  current condition of the local leasing market  past experience and judgements supplied by professionals in the local real estate market 
these estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and may change 
additional charges could be required as a result in the changes in estimates 
accounting for income taxes 
income taxes are recorded for each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
management records the actual current income tax payable and assesses the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
significant management judgment is involved in assessing the company s ability to realize any future benefit from deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from management estimates and management adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company s operating results and financial position could be materially affected

establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets  excluding goodwill  and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell

the company believes that cash flow from operations should be sufficient to fund the company s capital expenditure and working capital requirements through forward looking statements and risk factors this report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are being provided pursuant to that legislation 
in addition to the other information contained in this form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business 
the following is not intended as  and should not be considered  an exhaustive list of relevant factors 
obsolescence and technological change the communications industry is in a state of rapid technological change 
the introduction of new technologies  network architectures or changes in industry standards can render the company s existing products or products under development obsolete or unmarketable 
for example  satellite  wireless and other communication technologies under development or currently being deployed may represent a threat to copper  coaxial and fiber optic based systems by reducing the need for wire line networks 
further  while management anticipates that a number of factors  including network capacity requirements  existing investments in wire line networks  security and long term cost effectiveness  will result in growth of wire line networks  there can be no assurance that future advances or further development of these or other new technologies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s growth strategies are designed  in part  to take advantage of opportunities that the company believes are emerging as a result of the development of enhanced voice  video  data and other transmission networks  and high speed internet access in the telecommunications industry 
there can be no assurance that demand resulting from these emerging trends will continue or that the 
table of contents company s products will be met with market acceptance 
importance of new product development to growth a significant factor in the company s ability to grow and remain competitive will be its ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards  and to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis 
new product development often requires long term forecasting of market trends  development and implementation of new designs and processes  and substantial capital commitment 
trends toward consolidation of the communications industry and convergence of technologies may require the company to quickly adapt to rapidly changing market conditions and customer requirements 
the company s manufacturing and marketing expertise has enabled it to successfully develop and market new products in the past 
however  any failure by the company to anticipate or respond in a cost effective and timely manner to technological developments or changes in industry standards or customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
concentration of customers  limited backlog the telecommunications industry is concentrated 
a relatively small number of customers account for a large percentage of the company s available market 
consequently  the company s five largest customers accounted for and of the company s total net sales in and  respectively 
comcast at t broadband accounted for of the company s total net sales in aol time warner accounted for of the company s total net sales in mergers and acquisitions in the telecommunications industry  which are expected to continue  not only increase the concentration of the industry and of the company s customer base but also from time to time delay customers capital expenditures as newly merged service providers consolidate operations 
in the event one of the company s major customers were to terminate purchases of the company s products  the company s operating results would be adversely affected 
the company s customers typically require prompt shipment of the company s products within a narrow timeframe 
as a result  the company has historically operated with a relatively small backlog 
sales and operating results in any quarter are principally dependent upon orders booked and products shipped in that quarter 
further  the company s customers generally do not enter into long term supply contracts providing for future purchase commitments for the company s products 
these factors  when combined with the company s operating leverage see operating leverage below and the need to incur certain capital expenditures and expenses in part based upon the expectation of future sales  may place the company s operating results at risk to changing customer buying patterns 
if sales levels in a particular period do not coincide with the company s expectations  operating results for that period may be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on the telecommunications industry the company expects that sales to the telecommunications industry will continue to represent a substantial portion of its total sales 
demand for products within this industry depends primarily on capital spending by service providers for constructing  rebuilding  maintaining or upgrading their systems 
the amount of capital spending and  therefore  the company s sales and profitability  are affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  access by service providers to financing  government regulation of service providers  demand for services and technological developments in the telecommunications technology 
while the industry generally experienced above average growth in the late s  in and the telecommunications equipment industry was materially adversely affected by service providers reductions of their capital expenditures 
the company s success is dependent upon continued demand by the communications industry for products used in signal transmission systems which may be affected by factors beyond the company s control  including the convergence of video  voice  and data transmission systems occurring within the catv and telephone markets  continuing consolidation of companies within those markets and the provision of internet access by cable operators and local telephone companies

table of contents materials  including resins  used in the company s manufacturing processes 
the company does not engage in hedging transactions for such materials  although it periodically enters into contracts for certain raw materials for as much as one year or more 
there can be no assurance that price increases in raw materials can be passed on to the company s customers through increases in product prices 
in addition  in order to position itself as a full line product supplier  the company relies on certain manufacturers to supply products  including grade level boxes that complement the products manufactured by the company 
although the company believes there are multiple sources of supply for these products  disruptions or delays in the supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the company s own products 
energy costs and availability the company s cost of sales may be materially affected by increases in the market prices of electricity  natural gas and water used in the company s manufacturing processes

the failure to obtain any or all of the desired results from acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
operating leverage because the fixed costs of facilities  product development  engineering  tooling and manufacturing are a relatively high percentage of total costs  the company s ability to operate profitably is dependent on generating a sufficient volume of product sales  thereby spreading fixed costs over the sales base 
due to this operating leverage  a reduction in sales or the rate of sales growth has had in the past and could have in the future a disproportionately adverse effect on the company s financial results 
seasonality and fluctuations in operating results the company s business is seasonal in nature  with the first and fourth quarters generally reflecting lower sales due to the impact of adverse weather conditions on construction projects that may alter or postpone the needs of customers for delivery of the company s products 
in addition  first quarter sales may also reflect customer delays in implementation of their annual capital expenditure plans 
the company s operating results may also fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to several other factors  including the volume and timing of orders from and shipments to major customers  the timing of new product introductions and deployment as well as the availability of products by the company or its competitors  the overall level of capital expenditures by catv operators and telephone companies  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  variations in the mix of products the company sells  and the availability and costs of raw materials
