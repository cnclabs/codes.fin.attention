the company wishes to caution that the foregoing list of important factors may not be all inclusive and specifically declines to undertake any obligation to publicly revise any forward looking statements that have been made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
with respect to forward looking statements set forth in the notes to consolidated financial statements  including those relating to contingent liabilities and legal proceedings  as well as the company s annual report on form k  some of the factors that could affect the ultimate disposition of those contingencies are changes in applicable laws  the development of facts in individual cases  settlement opportunities and the actions of plaintiffs  judges and juries 
the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and its affiliates and notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies first midwest s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry 
application of critical accounting policies  those policies that management believes are the most important to the company s financial position and results  requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions  and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
first midwest has numerous accounting policies  of which the most significant are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on page of this form k 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that its accounting policies with respect to the reserve for loan losses and income taxes are the accounting areas requiring subjective or complex judgments that are most important to the company s financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies as discussed below 
reserve for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of reserve for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the company s reserve for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known  and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 

table of contents management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses as well as the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
the reserve is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on page of this form k 
income taxes the company accounts for income tax expense by applying an estimated effective tax rate to its pre tax income 
the effective tax rate is based on management s judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes 
in addition  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities  recorded in the consolidated statements of condition  based on management s judgments and estimates regarding temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is unlikely 
in making this assessment  management must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years  the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income  and the possible application of future tax planning strategies 
although the company has determined a valuation allowance is not required for all deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee that these assets are recognizable

changes in net interest income generally occur due to fluctuations in the volume of earning assets and paying liabilities and the rates earned and paid  respectively  on these assets and liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of total interest earning assets 
for purposes of this discussion  both net interest income and margin have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax exempt loans and securities to those on taxable earning assets 
the accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans  securities  and other earning assets are presented in notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on pages   and  respectively  of this form k 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased by  or  to  in compared to  in and  in tax equivalent net interest margin was in as compared to in and in the increase from in both net interest margin and net interest income was primarily due to the magnitude and timing of s historic decline in interest rates and the continued low level of interest rates in as a result  s interest expense declined by  from outpacing the decline in interest income of  in  the increase in both net interest margin and net interest income from was driven by profitable loan growth and the drop in interest rates over the course of the year

table of contents market risk and interest rate sensitivity management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and equity prices 
interest rate risk is first midwest s primary market risk and is the result of reprice  basis  and option risk 
reprice risk represents timing mismatches in first midwest s ability to alter contractual rates earned on financial assets or paid on liabilities in response to market interest rates 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of the spread earned on a loan or investment relative to its cost of funds 
option risk arises from the embedded options present in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options or deposit early withdrawal options 
these provide customers opportunities to take advantage of directional changes in rates and could have an adverse impact on first midwest s margin performance 
first midwest seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and net income while managing volatility that arises from shifts in interest rates 
the asset and liability management committee alco oversees financial risk management by developing programs to measure and manage interest rate risks within board authorized limits 
alco is also responsible for approving first midwest s asset liability management policies  overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings  and reviewing first midwest s interest rate sensitivity position 
management uses net interest income and economic value of equity simulation modeling tools to analyze and capture near term and longer term interest rate exposures 
net interest income represents first midwest s primary tool for measuring interest rate sensitivity 
net interest income simulation analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income to various interest rate movements and balance sheet structures 
the simulation is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off balance sheet instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
the simulation includes management projections for activity levels in each of the product lines offered by the company 
assumptions based upon the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to interest rates are also incorporated into the simulation 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the simulation cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of the fluctuation in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
alco monitors and manages interest rate risk within approved policy limits 
the simulation model assesses the magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates over both a and month horizon and uses multiple rate scenarios 
these scenarios include  but are not limited to  a flat or unchanged rate environment  a most likely forecast which the company believes to be the most probable outlook  a graduated increase and decrease of basis points that occurs in equal steps over a six month time horizon  and immediate increases and decreases of and basis points 
the company s current interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the change in net interest income over a month horizon assuming a significant basis point graduated increase in all interest rate limits 
current policy limits this exposure to plus or minus of the anticipated level of net interest income over the corresponding month horizon assuming no change in current interest rates 
the company s month net interest income sensitivity profile as of year end and is as follows 
table analysis of net interest income sensitivity graduated change in rates immediate change in rates december  december  reflects an assumed change in interest rates that occurs in equal steps over a six month horizon 
due to the low level of interest rates as of year end and  management s judgment was used to set reasonable levels of change in the yield curve and establish  where appropriate  interest rate floors for select interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents s sensitivity profile reflects a decrease from in the degree of net interest income change  given a significant rise in interest rates 
in the case of an immediate basis point change in rates  the adverse impact to net interest income declined to a negative in from a negative in this decrease is reflective of management s efforts to better insulate future net interest income exposure to rising interest rates 
as mortgage interest rates reached year historic lows in third quarter  refinance related prepayments accelerated  and cash flows received from mortgage backed securities increased significantly 
as further discussed in the subsequent section entitled investment portfolio management  the company adopted investment strategies that allowed the effective duration of its billion securities portfolio to shorten 
this strategy  while dampening net interest margin in third and fourth quarter  gives the company the flexibility to extend the portfolio s duration and receive higher yields as market opportunities present themselves in in addition  through pricing and promotional strategies further described in the subsequent section titled funding and liquidity management  the company was able to reduce its exposure to rising rates by growing core  non indexed transactional accounts and lengthening the maturity of time deposits and certain borrowed funds 
in the case of a basis point graduated change in interest rates  net interest income is estimated to be adversely impacted both in rising and falling rate scenarios 
this condition is caused by differing repayment rates of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in increasing and decreasing rate environments and the greater latitude to raise rather than lower some deposit rates  given the already very low level of interest rates 
in addition to the simulation analysis  management uses an economic value of equity sensitivity technique to capture the risk in both short and long term positions 
alco uses the economic value of equity sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long term cash flows on earnings and capital 
economic value of equity involves discounting present values of expected cash flows on all assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts under different interest rate scenarios 
the discounted present value of all cash flows represents first midwest s economic value of equity 
economic value of equity does not represent the true fair value of asset  liability  and derivative positions  since it does not consider factors like credit risk and liquidity nor does it consider the impact of future changes to the balance sheet 
first midwest s policy guidelines call for preventative measures to be taken in the event that an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points is estimated to reduce the economic value of equity by more than 
at december   an immediate basis point increase in market rates would negatively impact first midwest s economic value of equity by as compared to in an immediate basis point decrease in market rates  as adjusted to allow for s already low level of interest rates  would positively impact the economic value of equity by in as compared to in consistent with previously discussed net interest income simulation findings  s sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising interest rates was reduced due to certain security portfolio management and deposit pricing strategies undertaken to reduce exposure to rising interest rates 
s sensitivity to falling rates was reduced in comparison to due to the low level of interest rates that existed at the end of overall  first midwest believes that its current balance sheet structure and net interest income performance  while adversely impacted by significant  rapid increases in interest rates  is less vulnerable to increasing interest rates as compared to the condition that existed at year end conversely  first midwest s balance sheet and net interest income is more vulnerable to an immediate decrease in interest rates than it was at the year end due to the low level of interest rates 
as part of its approach to controlling the interest rate risk within its balance sheet  first midwest has utilized derivative instruments specifically interest rate swaps with third parties in order to limit volatility in net interest income 
the advantages of using such interest rate derivatives include minimization of balance sheet leverage resulting in lower capital requirements as compared to cash instruments  the ability to maintain or increase liquidity  and the opportunity to customize the interest rate swap to meet desired risk parameters 
the accounting policies underlying the treatment of derivative financial instruments in the consolidated statements of condition and income of first midwest are described in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on pages and  respectively  of this form k 
interest rate swap transactions involve exchanges of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying notional ie  principal amount on which the interest payments are calculated 
when the interest rate swap has been appropriately designated as a hedge  the net cash flow paid or received by first midwest on these transactions is treated as an adjustment to interest income and expense on the underlying earning asset or funding source to which the swap relates 
a risk associated with interest rate swap transactions is credit risk  defined as the ability of the swap counterparty to perform its interest payment obligation under the terms of the agreement 
credit risk on interest rate swap transactions consists of the aggregate net interest payable to first midwest by the counterparty in addition to the aggregate unrealized gain on the swap position 
first midwest controls this credit risk by reviewing each counterparty for creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and maintaining a policy limiting credit exposure to any one counterparty to not more than of consolidated stockholders equity 
in addition  first midwest s interest rate swap transactions require the establishment of a mutual mark 
table of contents to market arrangement whereby cash collateral is required to be on deposit with first midwest and or the counterparty  depending upon the existing net settlement position 
first midwest does not act as an intermediary in arranging interest rate swaps for customers 
as of december  and  first midwest had total interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of  and  in place  respectively  hedging various balance sheet categories 
the specific terms of the interest rate swaps outstanding as of december  and are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on page of this form k 
funding and liquidity management liquidity management is the ability to provide funding sources at a minimum cost to meet fluctuating deposit  withdrawal  and loan demand needs 
first midwest s liquidity policy establishes parameters as to how liquidity should be managed to maintain flexibility in responding to changes in liquidity needs over a month forward period  including the requirement to formulate a quarterly liquidity compliance plan for review by the bank board of directors 
the compliance plan includes a recorded analysis that measures projected needs to purchase and sell funds 
inherent in the analysis is a set of projected balance sheet assumptions that are updated quarterly throughout the year 
based on such assumptions  first midwest determines its total cash liquidity on hand and adds to that position excess collateral capacity from pledging  unused federal funds purchased lines  and other unused borrowing capacity such as federal home loan bank advances  resulting in a calculation of first midwest s total liquidity capacity 
first midwest s total policy directed liquidity requirement is of total sources demand deposits  interest bearing transactions deposits  retail time deposits  other borrowings  and other liabilities and equity less pledged deposits 
based upon first midwest s projections as of december   the company expects to have net excess liquidity capacity  based upon policy guidelines  for the forward twelve month period 
table provides a year to year comparison of the sources of first midwest s liability funding based upon average balances over the last three years 
average  rather than period end  balances are more meaningful in analyzing first midwest s funding sources because of the inherent fluctuations that occur on a monthly basis within most deposit categories 
table funding sources average balances amounts in thousands of total of total of total demand deposits savings deposits now accounts money market accounts core transactional deposits time deposits core deposits repurchase agreements funds purchased and other borrowed funds borrowed funds total funding sources in and  first midwest focused its sales efforts on increasing core funding sources from deposits as funding costs are generally less expensive than wholesale  borrowed funds and do not typically require the pledging of securities as collateral 
as discussed previously in the section entitled market risk and interest rate sensitivity  commencing on page of this form k  these efforts were in concert with first midwest s strategy to reduce it exposure to increases in market interest rates 
as shown in table  average core deposits for totaled  representing an increase of  or  in and followed an increase of in over s level of average core deposits represented of total funding sources and approximated s level of 
average core transactional deposits increased by  or  over while average time deposits declined by 
table of contents  or 
the shift in deposit mix was driven by a combination of pricing and promotional strategies employed during late and throughout in late  first midwest introduced a non indexed  high yield interest bearing checking account at a day promotional rate  which by the end of totaled  the balances remained outstanding during all of and drove the increase in average now accounts as compared to the prior year 
over the same time period  time deposit pricing  while competitive across all terms  specifically emphasized longer term maturities 
the combination of these pricing strategies and the overall low level of interest rates and instability in the equity markets  created an incentive for customers seeking liquidity to shift balances to transactional accounts as opposed to shorter term time deposits 
as equity markets stabilize or interest rates increase  management expects that customer liquidity preferences will change and some portion of transactional balances will revert to time deposits as influenced by then existent pricing and competition

as of december   the weighted average maturity of repurchase agreements and fhlb advances was years as compared to 
years for this increase was consistent with management strategies to opportunistically lengthen interest bearing liability terms in the current low interest rate environment 
the liquidity needs of first midwest bancorp  inc parent company consist primarily of operating expenses of the parent company and dividend payments to first midwest s stockholders 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent company is dividends from affiliates 
at december   the parent company had short term credit facilities  which require no compensating balances  available to fund cash flow needs totaling  the parent company also has the ability to enhance its liquidity position by raising capital or incurring debt 
the parent company had no long term debt or debt outstanding under its short term credit facilities as of year end and had cash and equivalent short term investments of  as of such date 
analysis of noninterest income and expense noninterest income noninterest income  exclusive of security gains  decreased by in from  following an increase of in in  the lower interest rate environment  as well as weakened debt and equity markets  negatively impacted market sensitive revenue streams  such as trust revenue  corporate owned life insurance  and investment product fees derived from third party mutual funds and annuities included in other income 
offsetting these negatives were greater revenues derived from service charges on deposit accounts 
the year to year improvement in as compared to was realized primarily in the categories of service charges on deposit accounts and other commissions and fees and resulted from a combination of increased volumes of deposit accounts  greater customer activity  and improved fee assessment and collection practices started in the previous year 
the following table analyzes the components of noninterest income  excluding net security gains  for the years through table analysis of noninterest income amounts in thousands change service charges on deposit accounts trust and investment management fees other service charges  commissions  and fees corporate owned life insurance other income total noninterest income for a discussion of security gains  refer to the investment portfolio management section commencing on page of this form k 
service charges on deposit accounts represent the largest component of noninterest income and consists of fees on both interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposit accounts as well as fees related to checks drawn upon customer accounts with insufficient funds nsf fees and stop payment requests 
service charges on deposit accounts include both hard dollar charges and charges assessed through account analysis  the latter being reduced by earnings credits indexed to a short term us treasury yield and applicable to business deposit accounts only 
service charges on deposit accounts increased to  in  following a increase in the  increase in is primarily attributable to a increase in nsf fee revenues incident to a pricing increase implemented in first quarter further contributing to the increase are higher service charges on business checking accounts due to greater transaction volumes combined with lower earnings credit paid thereon as a consequence of lower short term interest rates that reduced the value of account balances maintained to compensate the bank for deposit service  which resulted in higher fees collected for account maintenance 
the increase of  in over was also attributable to an increase in nsf fees as well as increases in service charges on business checking and savings accounts 

table of contents the company provides trust and investment management services to its customers  acting as executor  administrator  trustee  agent  and in various other fiduciary capacities for client accounts 
these services were previously provided to clients through a stand alone trust company  which was merged into the bank in  thereby generating a more seamless integrated delivery of trust  investment management  and fiduciary services to the bank s more extensive commercial and personal client base 
assets under management and in nondiscretionary custody accounts totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
this category of noninterest income decreased by in as compared to following a decrease of in from trust and investment management fees generally follow the amount of total assets under management  as well as conditions in the equity and credit markets  as fees on certain accounts are based on market value 
trust and investment management fees have declined since principally as a result of a decline in the equity markets  which has reduced the value of assets under administration 
to a lesser extent  a shift in the mix of assets under administration from equity investment products to money market funds  which generate lower fees  also served to reduce trust and investment management fee income

portfolio composition first midwest s long term strategy is to distribute its loan portfolio approximately evenly among the categories of commercial and industrial including agricultural  consumer including real estate family and real estate both commercial and construction 
first midwest also looks to maintain a portfolio of corporate loans commercial and industrial  agricultural  commercial real estate and real estate construction that is well balanced and minimized exposure to any particular industry segment 
this type of diversification spreads the risk and reduces the exposure to economic downturns that may occur in different segments of the economy or in different industries 
it is first midwest s policy to concentrate its lending activities in the geographic market areas it serves  generally lending to consumers and small to mid sized businesses from whom deposits are gathered in the same market areas  with the primary market concentration being the chicago suburban banking market 
although first midwest s legal lending limit approximates million  the largest loan to one borrower at year end was approximately million  with only credits in the portfolio representing aggregate loans to one borrower in excess of million

total loans at december  grew  or  with all loan categories experiencing growth except for family real estate and consumer lending 
commercial loan growth was strong for  up over  while commercial and construction real estate increased by and  respectively  in comparison to retail consumer lending declined by  or  due to lower indirect automobile lending volumes and accelerated prepayments resulting from zero percent financing promotions offered by automobile manufacturers

during this period  loan growth was affected by first midwest s efforts to integrate billion in assets represented by the and acquisitions of spar bank  incorporated and heritage financial services 

table of contents as a result of those significant acquisitions and the related integration activities  first midwest outsourced certain loans that did not conform to its lending policies and securitized other loans  thereby removing them from the loan portfolio 
commercial and industrial loans increased  or  in this category of loans is diversified from an industry standpoint and includes loans to manufacturing  wholesalers  retailing  and other service businesses 
consistent with first midwest s emphasis on relationship banking  most of these credits represent core  multi relationship customers who also maintain deposit relationships and use other first midwest banking services such as cash management 
consumer loans  which decreased  or  in consist of loans made directly to individuals for various personal purposes  as well as indirect installment loans represented mainly by automobile financings acquired from dealerships in first midwest s primary markets 
this category also includes direct home equity loans and other direct installment loans 
the mix of credits within this lending category has shifted 
since the start of  promotional sales have increased home equity line balances by approximately million  or  and effectively offset declines in both direct consumer and home equity loans 
the loan growth in this category was experienced across all types of consumer loans 
real estate family loans are comprised predominately of owner occupied residential properties 
with the discontinuation of operations of its mortgage banking subsidiary in  first midwest reorganized the manner in which it offers mortgage products  whereby sales activities moved to its branch network while all administrative activities  including servicing  were outsourced to a third party vendor 
first midwest now earns commissions from the origination of mortgage loans  which are then either retained for portfolio or sold in the secondary market by the outsourcing vendor 
mortgage loan originations for increased by over following an increase of in from  due primarily to increased loan demand as a result of lower market interest rates 
driven by asset liability structural considerations  in first midwest elected not to retain a majority of its mortgage loan origination production  thereby accounting for the approximate decrease in and the decrease in real estate commercial loans  which increased by  or  in represent income producing commercial property loans  multi unit residential mortgages  and commercial real estate mortgages  many housing the operations of the borrower s business 
growth in this category has slowed following larger increases in this category during and  which  at that time  were reflective of the continuing significant demand for commercial properties in the suburban chicago banking market 
real estate construction loans  which grew by  or  in consist primarily of single family and multi family residential as well as non residential projects located in first midwest s primary markets 
real estate construction loans are a profitable line of lending for first midwest due to the higher level of interest rates and fees earned on such loans as compared to other loan categories and the favorable loss experience on these loans 
the growth experienced in was primarily the result of continued strong demand for single family and family residential construction in the chicago banking market 
the strength of the suburban chicago real estate market over the past several years has enabled real estate commercial and construction lending to grow to over one third of first midwest s total loans 
real estate commercial and construction lending has been an area of specialty for the company since its formation in the combination of seasoned  long time borrowers  experienced senior lending officers  management s focus on market fundamentals  and a stringent underwriting process has given the company a competitive market advantage 
along with balanced exposure to any particular industry segment as subsequently described in the section entitled distribution by industry segment  these same areas of strength reduce first midwest s exposure to loss through periods of economic downturn 
first midwest s loan loss experience for these two categories of lending is detailed in table on page of this form k 
distribution by industry table summarizes first midwest s twelve largest industry segments  as classified pursuant to the north american industrial classification system standard industry descriptions for the corporate loan portfolio as of december  and portfolio analysis by industry segment provides useful insight as to credit exposure to any particular industry or market segment 
the effectiveness of such analysis  however  is limited to the extent that classification by segment requires that allocation of a customer s aggregate loans outstanding be based upon the nature of the borrower s ongoing business activity as opposed to the purpose of collateral underlying an individual loan 
to the extent that a borrower s underlying business activity changes  classification differences will arise 
as a result  first midwest periodically reassesses and adjusts industry classifications

as discussed in the previous section entitled portfolio composition  credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification  which limits exposure to any single industry or customer 
similarly  credit risk is also addressed through the establishment of a thorough system of internal controls  which includes standard lending policies  underwriting criteria and collateral safeguards 
these internal controls that address credit risk also include the establishment and monitoring of formal credit policies and procedures as well as continuing surveillance and evaluation of the quality  trends  collectibility  and collateral protection within the loan portfolio which are monitored by an internal loan review staff 
the policy and procedures are reviewed and modified on an ongoing basis in order to remain suitable for the management of risk as conditions change and new credit products are offered 
first midwest s credit administration policies include a comprehensive loan rating system and an annual review by the internal loan review staff of at least of all corporate loans and commitments  which includes all new loans and commitments in excess of million 
furthermore  account officers are vested with the responsibility of monitoring their customer relationships and act as the first line of defense in determining changes in the loan ratings on credits for which they are responsible 
first midwest believes that any significant change in the overall quality of the loan portfolio will first manifest itself in the migration of loan ratings within this monitoring system 
finally  first midwest has historically had a very active process of senior manager review of those loans that have migrated in the loan rating system to a level that requires some form of remediation 
such loans are reviewed at regularly scheduled quarterly meetings between the credit administration staff and the account officers where action plans are developed to either remedy any emerging problem loans or develop a specific plan for removing such loans from the portfolio over a short  forward time frame 
during times of economic duress  first midwest will increase the frequency of these meetings to an every other month cycle rather than quarterly 
first midwest maintains a reserve for loan losses to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio 
the accounting policies underlying the establishment and maintenance of the reserve for loan losses through provisions charged to operating expense are discussed in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements commencing on pages and  respectively  of this form k 
the appropriate level of the reserve for loan losses is determined by systematically performing a review of the loan portfolio quality as required by the credit administration policy and procedures described above 
the reserve for loan losses consists of three components i specific reserves established for any impaired commercial  real estate commercial and real estate construction loan for which the recorded investment in the loan exceeds the measured value of the loan  ii reserves based on historical loan loss experience  and iii reserves based on general economic conditions as well as specific economic factors in the markets in which first midwest operates 
loans within the portfolio that are selected for review to determine whether specific reserves are required include both loans over a specified dollar limit as well as loans where the internal credit rating is below a predetermined classification 
loans subject to this review process generally include commercial and agricultural loans  real estate commercial and real estate construction loans 
specific reserves for these loans are determined in accordance with the provisions of the accounting policies referred to above 
consumer and other retail loan reserve allocations are based upon the evaluation of pools or groups of such loans 
the component of the reserve based on historical loan loss experience is determined statistically using a loss migration analysis that examines loss experience and the related internal rating of loans charged off 
the loss migration analysis is performed quarterly and loss factors are periodically updated based on actual experience 

table of contents the third component is determined based upon a number of general factors including the changes in composition of the loan portfolio  recent net charge off experience by loan category  as well as general economic conditions  and involves a higher degree of subjectivity in its determination and allocation 
this component of the reserve considers risk factors that may not have manifested themselves in first midwest s historical loss experience 
table shows the allocation of the reserve for loan losses by loan category  as well as charge off and recovery information for the last years 
as of year end  the allocation of the reserve for loan losses to commercial and industrial  commercial real estate  real estate construction  and consumer loan categories increased as compared to this increase was due to general delinquency trends and the level of nonperforming loans  as well as continued concerns arising from existent economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the decrease in the agriculture category allocation for compared to was the result of lower nonperforming loan levels and improved delinquency trends
