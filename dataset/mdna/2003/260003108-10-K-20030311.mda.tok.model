in a limited number of revenue transactions  other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and  accordingly  revenues are deferred until the customer is obligated to pay  or acceptance has been confirmed 
shipping and handling fees are not material and are generally credited to revenue with related costs principally charged to cost of sales 
service revenues are recognized and earned when services are performed and are not significant to any period presented 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
though dover considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates could have a material effect on reserve balances required 
in times of rapid market decline  such as affected a number of dover technologies companies in and  reserve balances needed to be adjusted in response to these unusual circumstances 
inventory for the majority of the company s subsidiaries  including all international subsidiaries and the dover technologies segment  are stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
other domestic inventory is stated at cost  determined on the last in  first out lifo basis  which is less than market value 
under certain market conditions  estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the company to properly value inventory 
dover technologies companies tend to experience higher levels of inventory value fluctuations  particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time 
during the year  the company established restructuring reserves at a number of operations 
these reserves  for both severance and exit costs  required the use of estimates 
though dover believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans  actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 
dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines including the recently adopted sfas no 
for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions 
dover s assets are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations 
the valuation of dover s pension and other post retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets liabilities 
these assumptions include discount rates  investment returns  projected salary increases and benefits  and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in dover s pension reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for dover s future pension obligations 
changes in assumptions and of future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on dover s pension expenses and related funding requirements 
dover s expected long term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns and portfolio allocation 
dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes to tax codes and rulings  changes in statutory tax rates and the company s future taxable income levels 
dover has significant accruals and reserves related to its risk management program 
these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment in regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
the company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions  dover experience  and relevant industry data 
dover considers the current level of accrual and reserves adequately valued relative to current market conditions and company experience 
dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify dover s ultimate exposure in these matters 
the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to assure that dover is properly reserved 
reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues 
while dover believes that the current level of reserves is adequate  changes in the future could impact these determinations 
the company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various reasons 
estimates are used to properly restate the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale 
changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates 
liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends  stock repurchases  adequacy of available bank lines of credit and the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
cash flows from continuing operations in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities   cash flows used in investing activities   cash flows used in financing activities   the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from of million is primarily due to lower decreases in accounts receivable and inventories  which provided cash of million in as compared to only million in in addition  a large estimated federal tax payment of approximately million was made in and a discretionary million cash contribution was made to the company s pension plans 
lastly  cash outflows associated with restructuring and exit costs also decreased operating cash flows 
cash used in investing activities decreased million in as compared to capital expenditures decreased million to million reflecting reduced need 
capital expenditures for are budgeted to be approximately million  but the company expects the actual level to be lower and will internally finance these capital expenditures 
during  the company invested on a net economic basis defined as the gaap purchase price adjusted for debt assumed and cash acquired million in acquisitions as compared to million in which is a decrease of million or 
acquisition activity in is expected to approach levels but is largely dependent upon the availability of appropriate acquisition candidates 
cash used in financing activities was primarily for the cash dividends paid to stockholders of million  the repurchase of  shares of treasury stock at an average price of for million  and finally the repayment of commercial paper borrowings  offset by million in proceeds from the termination of two interest rate swap agreements 
the principal cause for the decrease of million in for cash used in financing activities was due of to a net decrease in notes payable and long term debt of million in as compared to only a million decrease in net debt and capitalization in thousands total debt   less cash and cash equivalents   marketable securities net debt   add shareholders equity   total capitalization   total debt to total capitalization net debt to total capitalization the company utilizes the total debt and net debt to total capitalization calculations to assess its overall financial leverage 
under the terms of the two new revolving credit agreements dated october which replaced the old revolving credit agreement dated november  the company has million of bank credit availability 
the arrangements include a million day facility and a million year facility 
the new day facility bears interest at libor plus 
and the new year facility bears interest at libor plus 
the key financial covenant of these facilities requires the company to maintain an interest coverage ratio of ebitda to net interest expense of not less than to the company has been in compliance with the covenant and the ratio was to as of december  this credit facility was unused during under the terms of the old revolving credit agreement dated november  the company had million of bank credit availability 
this credit facility was unused during the company chose to decrease the aggregate amount of its revolving credit facility from million to million due to the anticipated reduced need for short term financing 
the company intends to replace the million day credit facility on or before its expiration date of october  at equivalent market rates 
the company established a new canadian credit facility in november of under the terms of this credit agreement  the company has a canadian cad million bank credit availability and has the option to borrow in either canadian dollars or us dollars 
at december   the outstanding borrowings under this facility were million in us dollars 
the covenants and interest rates under this facility match those of the primary million revolving credit facilities 
the canadian credit facility expires on november  the company intends to replace the canadian credit facility on or before its expiration date at comparable market rates 
the primary purpose of these agreements is to act as an alternative for short term financing in the event of a disruption in the commercial paper market which the company normally accesses for its short term borrowing needs 
the company may  from time to time  enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes 
interest rate swaps are agreements to exchange fixed and variable rate payments based on the notional principal amounts 
as of december   the company had two interest rate swap agreements terminating on november  with a total notional amount of million to exchange fixed rate interest for variable 
both swaps were designated as fair value hedges of the million notes  due november   and the net interest payments or receipts from these agreements  during  were recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
there was no hedge ineffectiveness as of december  and the fair value of the interest rate swaps determined through market quotation of million was reported in other assets and long term debt 
during  both of the interest rate swaps were settled  which resulted in net gains of million 
these gains were deferred and are being amortized over the balance of the term of the debt  permanently reducing the effective interest rate of the million notes  due november  from to 
in  the company filed a shelf registration for the issuance of up to billion in senior debt securities and on february  issued million of notes due february  under this registration 
the proceeds were used to reduce short term commercial paper borrowings 
under the shelf registration up to million of debt securities could be issued currently  if such financing was required 
management is not aware of any potential impairment to the company s liquidity  and the company was in compliance with all its long term debt covenants 
it is anticipated that in any funding requirements above cash generated from operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper or  depending upon market conditions  through the issuance of long term debt or some combination of the two 
of the company s credit ratings are as follows for the years ended december short term long term short term long term moody s p a p a standard poor s a a a a fitch f a f a a summary of the company s long term debt maturities and rental commitments as of december  is as follows in thousands total thereafter long term debt      rental commitments       total obligations       the company utilizes the current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities and the quick ratio current assets net of inventories divided by current liabilities to assess its overall ability to meet short term obligations 
in thousands current ratio quick ratio in  accounts receivable increased million to million  inventories decreased million to million and accounts payable decreased million to million 
decreased inventory levels resulted from declining volumes and reserves recorded in of approximately million to state inventory at the lower of cost or market  primarily in the technology segment 
at december   the company s net property  plant  and equipment amounted to million compared with million at the end of the preceding year 
goodwill decreased million as a result of the impairment recorded for million upon adoption of sfas offset by goodwill from acquisitions of million and the cumulative translation adjustment and other adjustments for million 
intangible assets  net of amortization increased million during principally as a result of acquisitions 
the aggregate of current and deferred income tax liabilities decreased from million at the beginning of the year to million at year end 
this decrease resulted primarily from the payments of amounts related to extensions granted for us estimated tax payments in retained earnings decreased from  million at the beginning of to  million at december  the million decrease resulted from net losses of million  and cash dividends which aggregated million 
stockholders equity decreased from  million to  million 
the million decrease resulted mainly from the million decrease in retained earnings and treasury stock purchases of million reduced by equity adjustments related to foreign currency fluctuations of million 
dover s consolidated pension benefit obligation increased by million in the increase was due principally to increases in actuarial losses 
in addition  plan assets decreased million due to losses sustained on plan investments during the year partially offset by contributions of million 
due to the decrease in the net funded status of the plans  it is estimated that pension expense will increase approximately million in the company anticipates having to contribute to its pension benefit plans in between million and million 
the company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk based interest rates for the foreseeable future 
acquisition spending would increase company debt but  management anticipates that the debt to capital ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels 
operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the company s various cash flow requirements  including acquisition spending and pension funding as needed

compared with summary in  dover corporation sales declined from to  million 
this decline was primarily due to the dramatic impact on dover technologies of the market contraction in demand for its products serving the electronics industry 
all of the dover technologies businesses were impacted 
at the same time  many of the industrial businesses in the other three operating segments were negatively impacted by the slowdown in general economic activity 
as a result  segment income from continuing operations totaled million in  a decline of from record earnings of million in technologies in  a boom year  dropped to million in industries earnings of million in  declined to million in  the result of weak markets for most companies 
diversified s earnings declined from million in to million in  largely due to operational problems at crenlo  but also due to weak markets for several businesses 
dover resources earnings declined from million in to of million in  as strength in oil and gas related businesses until late in the year were offset by weakness in industrial markets 
as the result of unexpectedly weak market conditions  efforts were made throughout the year  and more intensively as the year progressed  to right size by reducing employment levels  eliminating costs  and restructuring operations 
dover diversified dover diversified s sales increased in to  million  but earnings declined to million 
continuing earnings were reduced million by charges for restructurings  inventory  accounts receivable and other reserves 
before these charges  earnings were down 
segment profit margins declined to from 
a substantial amount of the decline in earnings related to crenlo  where strong earnings in became a significant loss in this  along with earnings declines at tranter  mark andy and swf  caused by difficult market conditions  offset gains at hill phoenix  sargent  waukesha and performance motorsports 
hill phoenix s sales increased dramatically  setting a new record in  easily retaining its number one sales position within diversified 
this was accomplished in a market that declined about during the year 
hill phoenix s market share gain should establish it as the strong number two company in its highly competitive marketplace 
market share growth was a function both of being well positioned with the fastest growing customers  and of penetrating new key accounts 
some of these are the large discount chains that are becoming larger competitors of the supermarket operators 
bookings grew and backlog increased all through the year  until the fourth quarter when some spending commitments were delayed into the coming year 
earnings were also sharply higher  as margins were maintained 
both sales and earnings were helped to a degree by the contribution of national cooler  a walk in cooler case business acquired in september in an effort to broaden the product line  which was successfully integrated into hill phoenix operations 
in a year when the competitive landscape was marked by consolidation  particularly in the supermarket industry  the stability and experience of the hill phoenix management team and the perceived technical superiority of its product line both contributed to growth in market share 
tranter  one of diversified s largest businesses  again captured the distinction of being its largest profit contributor despite significant erosion in profit margin 
tranter s trend of steady growth and high  stable margins was broken in a very challenging tranter is highly dependent on industrial capital spending  one of the weakest sectors of the economy 
in addition  the strength of the us dollar gave foreign based competitors an advantage in the us radiator market  and price competition was severe 
also because of us dollar strength  the profitability of tranter s foreign operations was lower when translated from local currency 
some plant inefficiencies and temporary product line gaps also contributed to the shortfall in earnings 
crenlo had a very disappointing year  as a variety of post acquisition management challenges were further complicated by a weak market for which it was not well prepared 
this led to a substantial loss for  in contrast to a highly profitable  the first year after acquisition 
throughout  crenlo had focused on growing sales by providing a cost effective  quality source of cab enclosures to customers who had often manufactured these internally 
during the same period  the market for its electronics enclosures product line was growing dramatically with the electronics market generally 
a decision to build a second large  fully integrated plant for cabs was made in early  and by mid the plant was complete 
in early  it became apparent that during this growth oriented period  not only had internal controls over inventory begun to suffer  but also product costs had risen and pricing had eroded while fixed costs had risen substantially faster than the business was growing 
a new president was installed and he began the process of dealing with internal controls  and aligning the cost structure more closely to the existing order intake levels 
as the year progressed  all served markets began to slow down  and then  late in the year  contract rapidly 
costs added from the new plant added complexity to the management challenge 
new management s improvement initiatives were unable to keep pace with the declining market  and losses continued 
the focus is on customer satisfaction through on time delivery  quality and value and on regaining crenlo s historically stable profit profile 
sargent s sales  adjusted for operations discontinued in the fourth quarter  were up sharply due to a strong backlog at the beginning of the year and stable conditions in both the aerospace and marine markets for much of the year 
however  with the weakening of market conditions after the september th terrorist attacks  aerospace order intake  particularly in the profitable aftermarket segment of the business  declined precipitously along with airline of traffic 
earnings for the year were also up to record levels  as margins remained stable  despite heavy investment in new regional jet and marine product development programs 
at the end of the year  the airtomic business  which had been part of c 
lee cook in the dover resources segment  was transferred to sargent because of very strong synergies in the aerospace aftermarket repair and overhaul sector 
the incremental sales will roughly replace those of the discontinued operations  but with much higher margins 
investment in new aerospace programs and in developing new aftermarket service capabilities will continue 
mark andy s printing markets were weak throughout  leading to a substantial drop in profitability 
sales were higher due to the acquisition of comco at the end of march  but its sales and profitability were substantially below expectations as well 
as a result of the weak market  the integration of comco was accelerated  with more cost cutting at both facilities than had been originally planned 
significant reductions in employment and plant consolidations helped at both businesses  but these actions were not able to restore margins 
mark andy also consolidated facilities at its graphics microsystems business 
with the cost reductions completed to date  a renewed emphasis on marketing and new product development  and continued focus on gaining efficiencies  mark andy is well positioned for an improvement in the market  but significant improvement in profitability will likely await better market conditions 
waukesha bearings set an earnings record in on sharply higher sales 
this was driven primarily by continued strength in demand for its large bearing products from the gas turbine market 
demand for electrical power generation capacity was particularly strong  and bookings and backlog remained at high levels throughout the year 
however  the likely duration of this market s boom period  which had been expected to continue for at least a few more years  has recently been questioned with the decline in electrical usage in the economic downturn  relative to capacity recently added 
waukesha s geographic penetration  technical capabilities  and product offerings were substantially improved with the third quarter acquisition of federal mogul rpb  a uk based bearing manufacturing company 
this acquisition makes waukesha the clear market leader in its niche 
performance motorsports inc pmi had a much stronger sales and earnings performance in than it did in the prior year and a record performance on both metrics  with consistently high margins 
though this was helped by acquisitions of the carillo and perfect bore businesses in the second half  the core business also performed well for most of the year 
some market weakness was evident in the fourth quarter 
performance improvements were primarily due to investments in manufacturing efficiency and technical capabilities 
tangible improvements in throughput  quality and cost reduction were also due to a successful focus on lean manufacturing tools and techniques 
the recent acquisitions  though small  have also helped position pmi well in its markets through improved geographic coverage  manufacturing synergies and a broader array of technical capabilities for each of its market segments 
swf s sales increased substantially in largely due to the full year impact of acquisitions made in  and the contribution of acquisitions made early in however  earnings declined for two reasons 
externally  the market for swf s packaging machine products was down an estimated 
in this environment  swf was able to maintain market share 
internally  the management complexity of the acquisition integration process caused some slippage in focus on customers and product cost 
improved internal processes  and the renewed focus on product improvement and internal cost control should help improve margins regardless of market conditions 
belvac s position as the only remaining independent supplier of can forming equipment ties its fortunes to the capital spending cycles and sourcing preferences of its customers  some of whom have competing in house capabilities 
belvac is now structured to perform well even in the cyclical troughs in this market 
thus the weak market experienced in resulted in a meaningful sales decline but a more modest profit decline  enhancing its profile as a strong cash flow contributor 
in  langbein engelbracht s sales increased modestly  however  earnings were flat as competitive pricing pressures held margins down 
improved market segmentation  investment in sales coverage  focus on higher first pass yield  and project bidding with complementary suppliers may lead to more opportunities but anemic economic growth in europe will be a limiting factor 
dover industries dover industries sales in declined to  million  as general weakness in its industrial and commercial markets impacted most of its companies 
heil environmental  texas hydraulics  dovatech and the food service markets of groen and randell experienced the largest sales declines 
continuing earnings of million were reduced for the year by million in charges for restructurings  inventory and other reserves 
without those charges  earnings were down 
segment operating profit margins declined from to of after heil environmental s strongest earning year in its history in  market conditions entering  outside of large municipal markets such as new york city  were showing signs of softness 
as the year progressed  all the negative factors which can make this business cyclical such as capital spending constraints at the large waste haulage companies  higher fuel costs  and the impact of economic uncertainty on spending plans particularly by the independent smaller operators  were in evidence 
the loss of a major portion of one large customer s business during the first quarter compounded this problem  as did a slow down in product acceptance in new york city after september th 
these factors led results for the year to fall below those of the prior two years  both of which were new records at the time 
nonetheless  represented the third best year in company history and though margins declined  they remained significantly above the average for all industries companies 
heil environmental has responded with programs for lowering product cost  both through product redesign and lean manufacturing initiatives 
marathon  influenced by many of the same industry dynamics  was plagued not only by a very weak market  but also by fierce competition from a heavily leveraged competitor liquidating inventory at low prices 
marathon has a much broader range of product capability than any of its competitors  and can adapt more readily in such a market and it did receive important new business with large national waste haulage and chain store accounts 
however  marathon typically operates with relatively low backlogs  and the weak economy  particularly since the fourth quarter  has led the company to focus on internal cost containment programs to maintain its still above average margin levels 
for rotary lift  long one of industries largest earnings contributors and increasingly so  was both a very challenging and successful year 
the market for automotive lifts was down  after a smaller decline the prior year 
however  rotary s sales in were flat with the prior year  and it further improved its leading market share position 
rotary successfully continued its track record of using cost reduction to drive price competitiveness in the market  while maintaining margins 
rotary was also able to solidify its position by developing a new product  in bay tm 
having the most technologically advanced product has helped grow market share  particularly with larger accounts  such as the large auto repair chains 
heil trailer  one of industries largest companies measured by sales  endured its second straight year of double digit percentage earnings declines  which in turn followed a year of flat earnings  because of the continuing recession in its markets 
capital spending programs at the major oil companies for petroleum tankers have been hurt by the wave of industry consolidations and the market for dry bulk trailers has remained very weak 
a pickup in military orders  particularly at the recently acquired kalyn siebert business  helped later in the year 
the decline in the market has intensified competitive pricing pressure 
heil has responded with new products  such as safer low profile petroleum tanker trailers  and a repeatedly demonstrated commitment to cost reductions 
heil has thus been able to stabilize margins  albeit at much lower than traditional levels 
late in the year  heil suffered currency losses in its argentine operation due to that country s currency crisis  but the other small operations in the uk and thailand both showed improved performance 
heil trailer s ability to address global oil companies international product and service needs is a distinct competitive advantage 
texas hydraulics historical growth in sales and earnings  with very strong margins  has been driven by a product differentiation strategy to provide engineered solutions to customers hydraulic cylinder needs 
however  in all served markets were down substantially  particularly in texas hydraulics important aerial lift and utility platform markets 
this trend began in and was driven by consolidation in the rental equipment end markets for these applications 
it resulted in a substantial decline in sales and earnings  but a more modest margin deterioration 
texas hydraulics has responded by re emphasizing penetration in other end markets through new products and new designs  but price competition has been fierce due to excess industry capacity 
thus  significant investment has been made in lean manufacturing tools and techniques  leading to higher quality  quicker response time to customers  and lower labor and material cost 
pdq  which joined dover in mid  turned in yet another full year of substantial sales and earnings growth based on its continued penetration of the vehicle wash equipment market with its innovative touch less products 
pdq s success is based on successful new market introductions  close attention to competitive pricing  and continual cost reductions 
tipper tie struggled in with both internal and external problems that led to flat sales and lower margins 
early in the year  demand for capital equipment from meat processors was severely reduced by the mad cow and hoof and mouth disease scares  particularly in europe where roughly of tipper tie s sales are generated 
though this effect dissipated as the year progressed  margins for new equipment came under pressure as the soft market caused fierce competition 
intense price competition was also seen in the clip market 
miscues in product of introductions further depressed earnings 
entering  cost reductions particularly in the us  the introduction of proven european products into the us market  and new clip designs are the focus of tipper tie s still new management team 
triton  which was acquired in early  has under performed initial expectations  and was a particularly difficult year 
sales were flat  but profits were a fraction of the prior year 
adverse external factors included an industry upheaval caused by the rapid rise and then decline to bankruptcy of credit card center ccc  an independent sales organization that flooded the market with competitor s product 
this resulted in a market overloaded with a great many unused atm machines when ccc s business model proved unviable 
that overhang  which has not been fully absorbed by early  is further complicated by slowing domestic market growth  and resultant price competition 
internally  triton has struggled with delayed new product development and introductions  as well as manufacturing inefficiencies 
in the fourth quarter of  triton executed a major staff reduction  realigned the management structure in marketing and manufacturing  and re invigorated the product pipeline 
somero  acquired in mid  has also failed to meet initial expectations  and sales and earnings have declined significantly since acquisition 
the somero market niche is small and narrow  and its construction markets remain depressed 
chief automotive has been challenged for three years by the sluggish growth of a maturing market 
chief has responded by focusing on new product introductions and marketing programs geared to induce customers to trade up to new  high end products 
sales and earnings declined in but chief is maintaining market leadership and high returns on operating investment 
groen s institutional food service equipment market declined in  particularly in the fourth quarter  causing groen s sales and earnings to also decline 
a new management team has re invigorated product development and has begun introducing product line extensions and variations and has a new cost conscious business model to grow margins and cash flow 
randell s market  concentrated in the restaurant chains  has grown for a number of years as the percentage of meals eaten away from home increased 
however  this trend may have slowed 
the market  increasingly competitive  now depends more on renovations and less on new construction 
for  these trends were amplified in the weak economic environment  and margins suffered 
in  randell expects to renew its focus on new product development as a strategy to gain share  and on operational improvements for competitiveness and margin recovery 
after the sale of its main line welding products business in april of  dovatech s remaining laser and laser cooler business was hit hard by the economic downturn particularly in solid state applications for the telecommunications industry 
machine tool customers also slowed orders as the year progressed 
dover resources dover resources sales in increased to a record million  largely due to strength in the oil and gas production markets served by petroleum equipment group  c 
lee cook and quartzdyne  and due to the full year impact of add on acquisitions in earnings of million in were reduced by million in charges for restructurings  inventory and other reserves 
without those charges  earnings would have been slightly higher than the prior year 
operating profit margins declined from in to in  as very difficult conditions in the automotive and transportation markets impacted several dover resources companies 
petroleum equipment group s peg sales and earnings were both about higher than in  reaching a modern record post early s boom period 
through the first half of the year  demand was strong in the oil and gas production markets served and across all product lines  but particularly for sucker rods used in oil production 
after mid year  these markets weakened considerably  and by the end of  peg s results were comparable to the same period in significant investments in production capabilities and business streamlining initiatives since have resulted in lower product costs  improved flexibility and reduced cycle times 
these initiatives have also helped peg further increase its market penetration 
lower oil prices discouraged new drilling as the year progressed 
declining natural gas prices also reduced spending by natural gas producers 
however  all peg units were able to maintain solid profitability even while demand was weakening 
norriseal has been able to regain market share for its valves and controls through enhanced customer service  norris and aot have been successful with their sucker rod guide initiatives  and ferguson beauregard s plunger lift product line achieved solid success with its new initiative to provide complete control systems to natural gas producers 
of c 
lee cook s record sales and earnings results in reflected strong demand from the natural gas production and distribution customers both oem and aftermarket for its gas compressor components 
cook s recent investments in improved manufacturing processes  increased capacity  new products  product line extensions  and strong results from the service and repair operations at its compressor components unit contributed to the company s ability to capitalize on the strong market 
the demand for increased natural gas production evident earlier in has waned as new production has become available and demand and prices declined in a weaker economy 
as a result  c 
lee cook s sales in the oem segment of the market will likely decline in  with some possible offset from increased emphasis on aftermarket sales of components and services  new product initiatives and increased penetration in international markets 
quartzdyne also had record sales and earnings in  as high oil prices spurred new oil well drilling and completions in the first half of the year 
a result of product development initiatives  quartzdyne s ruggedized pressure transducer product line  utilizing enhanced quartz pressure sensor technology and hybrid circuit designs  is being increasingly used in measurement while drilling  permanent pressure measurement and intelligent completions applications 
in  opw fueling components managed a modest sales increase and maintained flat earnings and margins in a challenging market 
new service station construction activity has continued to be slow  as pricing pressure on the major oil companies and convenience store chains have curtailed investment 
the only source of significant new retail station growth has been in the hyper market segment 
industry consolidation at all levels of the market oil companies  distributors and competitors has been a dampening factor  but has left the company in a comparatively favorable position because of its strong product line and global reach 
replacement demand for opw fueling components broad product line of gasoline nozzles and other service station devices has been more stable 
success continues with the pisces tm line of underground secondary containment systems and with petro vend s automated fuel management systems 
opw fueling components investment for its new line of enhanced vapor recovery products positions it well as environmental compliance expectations increase in all markets 
in  opw fluid transfer group suffered from continued weakness in its petroleum  dry bulk  chemical and petrochemical transportation related businesses 
the benefits of a major business restructuring initiative undertaken in  which boosted s results  also helped maintain respectable margins in nevertheless  further cost reductions and restructuring actions were undertaken during the year 
opw fluid transfer group s focus in will be to maintain margins in a weak market  as it continues new product development and customer service initiatives in order to benefit from substantial positive operating leverage when transportation markets recover 
as a result of internal and operational improvements  better results from its international sales channels  and successful introduction of a complete line of plastic bolted pumps  wilden has maintained solid operational profitability in spite of the generally weak industrial and process industry markets it serves 
blackmer experienced a significant profit improvement in  as higher european sales and a more pronounced increase in european margins resulted from the streamlining actions initiated in with the exception of government related sales  most of blackmer s other served markets industrial  petroleum  chemical and petrochemical  and transportation related were generally weaker than the prior year 
the full year impact of acquisitions at tulsa winch group led to record sales and earnings 
in the early part of the year  tulsa winch benefited from strong demand from its oem customer base and a very strong market for its oil field winch product line 
as the year progressed  the oil field related market weakened and sales to its oem market slowed dramatically 
further progress is expected in in achieving synergistic benefits from the four previously independent companies that now comprise the tulsa winch group 
in the weak market expected in  these operational improvements and a more focused product offering will help position the company well for market recovery 
de sta co industries was challenged in by low general industrial market demand for its clamping and workplace automation products  particularly because of its sales concentration in the domestic automotive industry 
this decline in end user demand was made more pronounced by inventory reduction in distribution channels 
international markets were also weak  made worse by the strong us dollar 
sales of robotic equipment in the electronics assembly market also declined severely 
the result was a slump in profitability and margin decline 
de sta co industries has responded with numerous right sizing actions and a focus on factory productivity solutions 
this effort was boosted by the acquisition of cpi end of robot arm devices at the beginning of the year 
with further market declines expected  de sta co industries will accelerate market penetration efforts and continue tight cost control measures to hold profitability until economic conditions improve 
in  de sta co manufacturing maintained profits by reducing costs in the face of severe margin pressure from its automotive customer base  and at the end of the year finalized plans to exit an under performing business segment 
in of  de sta co manufacturing will focus on its core compressor reed valve and ride control disc customers with a much reduced cost structure 
rpa process technologies rpa had significant improvements in both sales and operating profit as its european unit recovered from a very poor performance in  the year it was acquired 
capital spending in rpa s markets  particularly in the paper industry  was weak throughout  and entering there are few signs of near term recovery in the global process industry markets that rpa serves 
hydro systems had a record year for both sales and earnings  as a result of success with new product and market initiatives and progress with cost reduction efforts 
the institutional and industrial cleaning market served by hydro systems has proven to be relatively recession resistant  although some market weakness is being experienced as hydro systems enters the global market for carbon dioxide generation and recovery equipment supplied by wittemann remains quite depressed and although duncan had another difficult year in  improved performance in the second half resulted from a reduced cost structure and increased customer focus 
dover technologies dover technologies sales in declined from the prior year to  million due to the well chronicled collapse of the technology sector 
technologies reported earnings of million after million in charges for restructurings  inventory and other reserves  following record earnings of million in  the unprecedented boom year for the electronics manufacturing market 
the lack of end market demand for electronics equipment caused technologies circuit board assembly and test cbat businesses customers to dramatically curtail spending for its predominantly capital equipment products 
cbat sales declined to million  and record earnings of million were transformed to a million loss 
technologies specialty electronics components sec businesses were similarly affected  particularly given their product focus on the higher technology data communications  telecommunications and networking markets 
sec sales declined to million  and record earnings in of million dropped to million 
imaje  the french based industrial ink jet printer manufacturer  had another very successful year 
cbat universal instruments experienced the largest percentage sales decline from the prior year in this group of companies a decline so large that universal is no longer dover s largest company and went from record profits to a sizable loss indeed universal accounted for the majority of the loss at cbat 
universal s high end products were particularly hard hit as large electronic manufacturing services ems and oem customers stopped adding capacity 
a similar thing occurred at universal s alphasem subsidiary when semiconductor assembly customers stopped expanding 
dek  whose increasingly well positioned  broad line  of circuit board screen printers had a smaller sales decline  as they also have lower priced products that appeal to customers that were not as hard hit by the downturn 
vitronics soltec had a lower rate of decline than either universal or dek as its comprehensive range of soldering machines improved their competitive position 
dek and vitronics soltec both have a strong european base  which trailed the us in the downturn  and both companies managed to generate a modest level of profitability 
everett charles technologies sales in declined less dramatically because some of their products are not capital equipment and they acquired multitest at mid year 
contact spring probes for instance  are not a capital item  and demand depends more on its customer s production volumes and new product introduction in electronics end markets 
however  these markets which were also slow in the portion of the business serving the semiconductor test market  including multitest  though well positioned competitively  saw demand decline to unanticipated low levels  creating an overall loss 
ok international  acquired in late  experienced a sales decline similar to dek and vitronics soltec  and reported a small loss in ok s products are generally shorter lived tools or consumables 
thus ok also depends largely on customers production levels  which were declining entering and remained at depressed levels all year 
this condition persists 
entering  customer demand for the large machines used in circuit board production  which had increasingly been centered with the large ems customers  had already begun to evaporate  and backlog was little more than half of what it had been at the market peak six months earlier 
as bookings and backlog continued to decline  losses mounted  peaking in the third quarter 
in the fourth quarter  with some relative stability in demand  albeit at depressed levels  together with the early benefits of substantial cost reductions  losses began to diminish 
the reaction to the dramatic downturn was to right size the business by reducing employment and eliminating all but critical operating of expenses 
at universal  for instance  near the end of  a complete organizational restructuring accompanied the third major employment reduction for the year 
at the end of the year  most remaining demand for larger machines was from smaller ems companies and some oems 
demands for replacement parts to service the installed base  re manufactured machines  other types of assembly machines  and through hole placement equipment were all also down substantially  though not as dramatically as in the core surface mount businesses 
at year end the group was still below the breakeven point 
throughout cbat  product development critical for long term market leadership in this still attractive market was maintained  albeit under close cost benefit scrutiny 
universal has recently introduced a new product  the all linear motor gsm b which sets new standards in flexible fine pitch applications  a market segment requiring both high speed and extreme placement accuracy 
universal s now self sufficient alphasem offspring also introduced a new product  the leading die sorter and die bonder suitable for the new millimeter wafer technology expected to become predominant in semiconductor manufacturing 
at dek  continued new product development and introduction in the traditional circuit board market are now also being supplemented by wafer bumping and ball attach applications for semiconductor manufacturers 
vitronics soltec s new offerings range from redesigned machines for lower end applications to entirely new technologies for selective soldering  suitable for mixed component attachment applications 
sec the sec companies all produce highly specialized  often custom designed  high end components used in a wide variety of electronic devices 
the largest served market is the telecommunications industry both wired and wireless primarily for infrastructure applications 
this market experienced a rapid ramp up through entering  backlogs were still high and much of the customer base remained optimistic that they could maintain reasonable volume levels 
however  order intake and market optimism dropped precipitously in the first quarter of  and backlog declined all year 
in the wired infrastructure end market  sec s customers were hurt as the collapse of the dot com bubble left the market glutted with unused equipment  and demand from end customers could not support the existing expanded capacity 
in the wireless market  the much anticipated boom in new markets and applications  such as g  failed to materialize  and the high cost of frequency licenses  followed by a contraction of capital availability  caused many carriers to restrict or eliminate spending 
demand in end markets for access devices cable and dsl modems  telephones and the like also slowed sharply 
in many cases  sec s customers were left with excess component inventory  causing not only low demand  but also cancellations of prior orders 
in other cases  customers  new product launches  critical to sec s leading technology orientation  were curtailed 
other markets for sec  representing roughly one third of sales  include the high reliability oriented  military  satellite  aerospace and industrial markets 
the sec companies saw modest growth in these markets in  as evidenced by the improved earnings at dow key microwave 
sec was somewhat cushioned by its geographic profile  as the market slowdown spread from the us  to europe  and then asia 
novacap  in particular  which acquired like sized  uk based  syfer in  with complementary technologies and customers  benefited from syfer s relatively stronger demand through the first half of the year 
each sec company has responded by significantly reducing headcount  restricting unnecessary spending  and lowering product cost 
dt magnetics  for instance  aggressively restructured its business by downsizing higher cost us operations and expanding off shore manufacturing in this case  in the dominican republic 
k l microwave and quadrant both moved aggressively to expand business opportunities in china 
the focus on china sourcing is motivated not only by the desire to lower product cost and retain price competitiveness  but to be closer to a healthy and growing telecom infrastructure market 
sec companies have also responded by enhancing their research  design and development activity 
with the market decline  the increased availability of talented technical experts has helped these companies develop the products needed to maintain market leadership 
examples include the development of new application specific integrated circuit asic designs at quadrant  and transformer products for customer chip sets at dt magnetics 
entering there is no clear evidence that the market will recover soon and the group is operating at about the breakeven level 
marking and coding imaje  the industrial business in this segment  had a very strong year under a new management team  particularly considering the switch of one large customer account to a different technology 
sales were up due both to the addition of the markpoint acquisition in june  and to a concentrated market penetration of effort 
earnings declined slightly  due to acquisition integration costs and expenses related to the upgrade of the organization  particularly in the sales network  but margins remained high

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt  commercial paper borrowings and investments in cash equivalents 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
a basis point increase in interest rates of the company s long term debt interest rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of the company s long term debt 
commercial paper borrowings are at variable interest rates  and have maturities of three months or less 
a basis point increase in the interest rates of the company s weighted average commercial paper interest rate on commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial impact on the company s pre tax earnings 
all highly liquid investments  including highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  are considered cash equivalents 
the company places its investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
a basis point decrease in interest rates of the company s weighted average interest rate would have an immaterial impact on the company s pre tax earnings 
the company does not enter into derivative financial or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign exchange the company conducts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in canada  europe  japan and other asian countries 
therefore  changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect the company s financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
as of december  the company had not established a formal foreign currency hedging program 
the company has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which the majority of all costs are local currency based
