in certain of these agreements  if credit losses exceed certain thresholds over specified periods of time  the company must reimburse the financial institution for the excess credit losses  up to a specified maximum as defined in the agreement  and conversely  if credit losses are less than specified thresholds over certain periods of time  the financial institution is required to reimburse the company for credit losses less than the specified thresholds  up to a specified maximum 
the company routinely reviews the credit loss experience underlying these agreements with the financial institution 
the company has estimated that at december   the maximum liability for credit losses under these agreements is  however  based on current estimates of expected losses  the company has established an accrual for credit losses of approximately  at december  if credit losses were to exceed current estimates  additional reserves may be required

table of contents including  i increases in operating costs and start up losses in the company s new operations  including the start up of the company s operations in southern california under its agreement with renewal by andersen  ii a decline in the home improvement business gross profit margin principally resulting from the mix of products sold  and iii the company s operating cycle in which marketing costs are expensed and revenues are recognized 
increased operating expenses and start up losses in october the company entered into an agreement with renewal by andersen rba  a wholly owned subsidiary of the andersen corporation 
the agreement provides for the company to be the exclusive window replacement retailer on an installed basis for rba in the greater southern california area 
andersen corporation  the parent of rba  is the most recognized and used brand in the window and patio door industry 
in february the company commenced operations in the southern california market under its agreement with rba  and on june   although three months behind schedule  the company opened its first rba showroom in torrance  california 
during the first quarter ended march   in connection with its rba operations  the company incurred approximately  in costs  including advertising  sales and management personnel expenses  and general operating expenses 
the company had no revenues in the first quarter period to offset its start up costs 
subsequent to the first quarter  the company experienced a number of start up issues with the rba operations  including delays in completing customer orders due to longer lead times to acquire the necessary materials  engaging a sufficient number of qualified installers  and delays in completing the company s showroom facility 
as a result  the rba operations incurred an operating loss of  in the year ended december  in may  the company began operating in the milwaukee  wisconsin market  and in june  the company acquired the operations of reface  inc  a home improvement company operating in the richmond and virginia beach markets

decline in home improvement gross profit margins the company s strategy is to provide consumers a variety of home improvement products and accordingly increase not only its market share  but also its share of the customer 
in this respect  the company has expanded its product offering within existing product lines  such as solid surface countertops in its kitchen remodeling line  as well as the addition of new product lines 
based on the sales prices established by the company for these products  gross profit margins can vary significantly by product 
in the year ended december   replacement window and bathroom remodeling revenues accounted for approximately of home improvement revenues  as compared to approximately of revenues in the year ended december  in addition  consumer demand for solid surface countertops has increased sharply as compared to the prior year 
these products generally have lower margins than other products offered by the company 
as a result of the mix of products sold  the company s gross profit margin has declined 
the company has increased its selling prices of certain products in january management does not believe that the price increases will adversely effect the company s revenue growth plans 
growth and operating cycle the company recognizes revenue upon completion of each sales order 
in its normal operating cycle  the company completes new sales orders within to days from the date an order is received 
the operating cycle is slightly longer in the company s replacement window product line 
under current generally accepted accounting principles  marketing costs are expensed as incurred 
as a result of the company s operating cycle  marketing expenses can precede the completion of sales orders by up to three months 
consequently  in periods in which the company s backlog of uncompleted orders increases due to the growth of its operations  or as a result of newly started operations  net income is adversely effected 
in the year ended december   the company home improvement business expanded its operations through initiatives in the milwaukee  richmond  virginia beach and westchester markets  and in southern california under its agreement with rba 
in the year ended december   and excluding the company s deck operations which were acquired on november   new sales orders were  an increase of from  in the year ended december  backlog of sales orders to be

in its normal operating cycle  marketing costs  which are expensed as incurred  can precede the completion of sales orders by up to three months 
in this respect  since revenues are recognized upon completion of each sales order  marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will generally be higher in periods of increasing production backlog of uncompleted sales orders 
however  marketing expenditures are generally concurrent with the securing of sales orders 
marketing expenses were of new sales orders in the year ended december  as compared to in the prior year

however  these media sources also generally result in higher sales efficiencies than telemarketing 
consequently  for the year ended december   marketing costs as a percentage of new sales orders declined as compared to the prior year 
the company is continuing to change and refine its marketing mix to higher cost media sources resulting from increased legislation and restrictions on telemarketing

the company s consumer financing business has several agreements with a certain financial institution for the purchase of rio portfolios

in certain of these agreements  the company deposits a portion of the proceeds of the portfolio sale  usually of the principal balance of rio s purchased  into a restricted bank account  to offset the institutions credit risk in its purchased portfolio the hold back reserve 
if credit losses exceed certain thresholds over specified periods of time  the company must reimburse the financial institution for the excess credit losses  up to a specified maximum as defined in the agreement  and conversely  if credit losses are less than specified thresholds over certain periods of time  the financial institution releases the hold back reserve to the company  and is required to reimburse the company for credit losses less than the specified thresholds  up to a specified maximum 
the company periodically reviews the credit loss experience underlying these agreements with the financial institution 
during the year ended december   approximately  of credit losses were charged against the reserve 
the company has estimated that at december   the maximum liability for credit losses under these agreements is  however  based on current estimates of expected losses  the company has established an accrual for credit losses of approximately  at december  on february   first consumer credit  inc entered into a million credit facility agreement the credit facility with autobahn as the lender  and dz bank as the agent 
fcca  a wholly owned  single purpose subsidiary of fcc  is the borrower under the credit facility and fcca will purchase rio portfolios from fcc 
the credit facility is a five year program funded out of dz banks conduit  autobahn  pursuant to which autobahn will fund loans made to fcca through the issuance of commercial paper 
dz bank will provide a standby liquidity facility necessary for autobahn to issue the commercial paper 
the credit facility is restricted to the purchase and financing of rio s  and is secured by the rio s purchased under the credit facility 
fcc is the servicer under the credit facility 
the company has guaranteed to fcca  the lender and agent the performance by fcc of its obligations and duties under the credit facility in the event of fraud  intentional misrepresentation or intentional failure to act by fcc 
among other provisions  and providing that no event of default has occurred and is continuing  the credit facility provides that i subject to the 
table of contents million credit limit  the maximum advance under the credit facility is of the amount of eligible rio s ii in the event that an rio ceases to be an eligible rio  fcca is required to pay down the line of credit in an amount by which the outstanding borrowings do not exceed the maximum advance rate applied to the outstanding balance of the eligible rio s  iii each advance under the facility will be an amount not less than  and will be funded by the issuance of commercial paper at various terms with interest payable at the rate of the agent s then current commercial paper rate plus  iv if the excess spread  as that term is defined in the credit facility  is less than a specified level  fcca is required to deposit funds into a sinking fund account  or purchase specified rate caps or other interest rate hedging instruments  to hedge to the extent possible the interest rate exposure of the lender  and v fcca shall pay agent s fees and expenses  including a structuring fee in the amount  the credit facility contains representations  warranties and covenants as is customary in a commercial transaction of this nature 
fcc purchases rio s from select remodeling contractors  including rio s generated by the company s home improvement operations 
prior to entering into the credit facility  once fcc had accumulated a portfolio of rio s  fcc sold these portfolios to banks and insurance companies under negotiated purchase commitments  earning a one time premium upon each sale 
in most cases  fcc has retained the collection and servicing of these accounts on behalf of the investor and fcc earns a servicing fee from the investor 
the credit facility provides fcc the ability to finance rio s purchased from remodeling contractors  and earn continuing finance charges over the life of the rio s as opposed to a lesser  one time premium it previously earned 
however  the change in the fcc s business model  from selling to financing portfolios of rio s  will adversely affect fcc s profitability and cash flow in the short term 
in this respect  fcc will forgo the initial one time premium it earned upon selling a portfolio  but fcc will earn finance charges over the life of the portfolio  typically a three to five year period 
consequently  until fcc has accumulated a sufficient amount of financed rio s  and finance charges earned on the rio portfolios reach a sufficient level  fcc s earnings will be adversely affected 
management believes that fcc will return to profitability in the first quarter of  and that fcc s long term profitability will improve due to the continuing income stream from the greater amount of finance charges earned 
additionally  since the maximum advance under the credit facility is of the amount of eligible rio s  and because of the expected adverse impact on fcc s short term earnings  the company may be required to seek additional financing to fund fcc s operations 
the company is currently reviewing alternatives for the additional financing  including the company s available borrowing capacity under its existing revolving credit facility with a financial institution 
although the company has no agreements or commitments for additional financing  management believes that the company will be able to secure the financing  if needed  through the issuance of equity securities or debt obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  or if available  that such financing will be on favorable terms 
the failure of the company to secure additional financing  if needed  could impair fcc s ability to fully utilize the available funds under the credit facility  as well as restrict fcc s ability to purchase rio s  which would have an adverse impact on fcc s results of operations 
although the company believes that it will have sufficient cash and borrowing capacity under its credit facilities to meet its anticipated working capital needs for the next twelve months  the company believes that it will need additional financing to fund its growth strategy  including acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  or if available  that such financing will be on favorable terms 
any such failure to secure additional financing  if needed  could impair the company s ability to achieve its growth strategy 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient funds or successfully achieve its plans to a level that will have a positive effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
the ability of the company to execute its growth strategy is contingent upon sufficient capital as well as other factors  including its ability to further increase consumer awareness of its products by advertising  its ability to consummate acquisitions of complimentary businesses  general economic and industry conditions  its ability to recruit  train and retain a qualified sales staff  and other factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
even if the company s revenues and earnings grow rapidly  such growth may significantly strain the company s management and its operational and technical resources 
if the company is successful in obtaining greater market penetration with its products  the company will be required to deliver increasing volumes of its products to its customers on a timely basis at a reasonable cost to the company 
no assurance can be given that the company can meet increased product demand or that the company will be able to satisfy increased production demands on a timely and cost effective basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s growth strategy will be successful  and if one or more of the component parts of the 
table of contents company s growth strategy is unsuccessful  there can be no assurance that such lack of success will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to a minimal amount of financial market risks from changes in short term interest rates as a portion of the company s debt contains interest rates which vary with interest rate changes in the prime rate or libor 
based on our current aggregate variable debt level  we believe that these rates would have to increase significantly for the resulting adverse impact on our interest expense to be material to our results of operations 
however  in february  the company s finance subsidiary entered into a million credit facility to finance the purchase of rio s 
the credit facility requires each advance under the facility will be an amount not less than  and will be funded by the issuance of commercial paper at various terms with interest payable at the rate of the agent s then current commercial paper rate plus 
consequently  in the future  the company s exposure to these market risks will increase with the anticipated increase in the level of our variable rate debt 
the rio s underlying the credit facility contain fixed rate interest terms 
if the excess spread  as that term is defined in the credit facility  is less than a specified level  the company is required to deposit funds into a sinking fund account  or purchase specified rate caps or other interest rate hedging instruments  to hedge to the extent possible the interest rate exposure of the lender
