item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a registered bank holding company headquartered in memphis  tennessee 
we provide banking and other financial services through our banking and non banking subsidiaries 
we are the surviving corporation from the july merger of national commerce bancorporation with ccbf 
our banking subsidiaries are nbc and nbc bank  fsb 
in north and south carolina  nbc operates under the name of central carolina bank 
we also are a owner of first market 
first market operates branch offices in the richmond  virginia area 
additionally  we own all of the outstanding common stock of numerous non bank subsidiaries that provide a variety of financial services 
in february  we acquired former wachovia and first union branches from wachovia bank  na and first union national bank 
in the transaction  nbc acquired loans of approximately million  investment securities of approximately billion and deposits of approximately billion 
in december  we acquired bancmortgage  an atlanta based mortgage originator 
bancmortgage is a subsidiary of nbc 
additional information on the acquisitions is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements relate to anticipated future operating and financial performance measures  including net interest margin  credit quality  business initiatives  growth opportunities and growth rates  among other things 
words such as expects  plans  estimates  projects  objectives and goals and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward looking statements 
we caution readers that such forward looking statements are necessarily estimates based on management s judgment  and obtaining the estimated results is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
such risks are discussed below 
this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
risk factors the following risks are those we believe to pose the greatest risk to our financial condition  operations and prospects fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest income a major element of our net income is our net interest income  which consists largely of the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
we cannot predict fluctuations of market interest rates  which are affected by  among other things  changes in inflation rates  levels of business activity  unemployment levels  monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve board  money supply and domestic and foreign financial markets 
rapid changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our funding costs and our net interest income and  consequently  our earnings per share 
competition with other providers of financial services could adversely affect our profitability our markets are intensely competitive 
competition in loan and deposit pricing  as well as the entry of new competitors in our markets through  among other means  de novo expansion and acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our operations in our existing markets 
moreover  we have expanded our operations into new markets  such as atlanta  and will continue to look for additional expansion opportunities  in each case facing substantial competition from financial institutions with better established infrastructure and presence in those markets 
competition could have a material adverse effect on our net interest margin  our ability to recruit and retain associates in new and existing markets  our noninterest income and our ability to grow our banking and non banking businesses at the same rate as we have historically grown 
moreover  the modernization act has removed many obstacles to bank holding companies entering other financial services businesses 
several larger bank holding companies could enter the transaction processing  asset management  securities brokerage and capital markets businesses in our markets  deploying capital resources that are significantly greater than ours 
such activities could adversely affect our banking and non banking businesses and have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
the weak united states economy and prospects for war and additional terrorism could adversely affect our growth rate the economy in the united states continues to be sluggish and there is significant uncertainty about the economic future 
various domestic or international military or terrorist activities or conflicts could further impact the domestic and international economy 
if the recovery of the domestic economy continues to lag  we could experience a decline in credit quality  resulting in higher charge offs and higher provisions for loan losses which would have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
in addition  we could have a decline in loan demand  our largest source of revenue 
we are subject to significant government regulation over which we have no control we are subject to regulation by federal banking agencies and authorities and the sec 
changes in or new regulations could make it more costly for us to do business or could force changes to the way we do business  either of which could have a material adverse effect on earnings 
the parent company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries as a primary source of funds to pay dividends to shareholders  cover debt obligations and for other corporate purposes 
federal banking law restricts the ability of our banking subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company 
although we expect to continue receiving dividends from our banking subsidiaries sufficient to meet our current and anticipated cash needs  a decline in their profitability could result in restrictions on the payment of future dividends to the parent company 
we could be adversely affected by certain pending litigation we currently are defending litigation  including the purported class action against first mercantile  nbc and ncf 
the defense of such litigation could be costly  and we or our subsidiaries could be held liable to the purported class of plaintiffs 
moreover  management could decide to settle the litigation if it believes settlement to be in the best interests of shareholders 
the costs of defense and or settlement and any judgment which might be rendered could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a variety of factors  including those described above  could cause actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in this report 
we do not assume any obligation to update these forward looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states gaap which require that we make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements that affect the amounts reported in those financial statements 
we believe that determination of the level of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than our other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level we consider adequate to provide for estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is increased though a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
the allowance is comprised of specific loan allocations  allocations for nonaccrual and classified loans and general allocations by loan type 
the allowance is a significant estimate and we regularly evaluate it for adequacy 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different levels of allowance and provisions for loan losses 
additionally  an extended economic downturn could result in additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
see allowance for loan losses for additional discussion of our methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
determining the fair value of assets  including the impairment of intangibles  is another area that involves a high degree of judgment and complexity 
certain assets  such as loans held for sale  are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value 
some of these assets do not have readily available market quotations and require estimation of their fair value 
we make these estimates based on valuation principles that may include discounting estimated future cash flows  utilizing standard valuation indices and or comparing instruments to comparable publicly traded instruments for which market quotations are readily available 
additionally  certain recorded assets  such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles  are subject to impairment 
as of december   we have unamortized goodwill totaling billion and core deposit intangibles totaling million 
gaap requires that applicable intangible assets be evaluated for impairment at least annually 
goodwill was evaluated as of january  and found not to be impaired 
factors that could affect our estimation of intangible assets include deterioration or sales of branches that resulted in intangible asset recognition  adverse regulatory action  increased competition or faster than anticipated run off of acquired deposits 
acquisitions in december  ncf acquired bancmortgage  a mortgage origination company headquartered in atlanta 
this transaction resulted in the issuance of  shares of our common stock and was accounted for as a purchase 
the future financial performance of bancmortgage may result in contingent payments as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  nbc acquired former wachovia and first union branches 
in the transaction  nbc acquired loans of approximately million and deposits of approximately billion 
results of operations of the acquisitions have been included in our consolidated statements of income from the respective dates of acquisition 
in november  we acquired southbanc shares  inc  a million south carolina financial institution with branch offices 
also in august  ncf acquired first vantage bank tennessee  a million financial institution located in knoxville  tennessee 
both transactions were accounted for as purchases 
results of operations of these acquired companies have been included in ncf s consolidated statements of income from the dates of acquisition 
in a march transaction  transplatinum acquired prime financial services  inc  a receivables financing company serving the transportation industry 
in addition to the ccb financial corporation merger  we acquired piedmont bancorp  inc  a million bank holding company headquartered in hillsborough  north carolina in april we acquired first mercantile and first mercantile capital in july these transactions the acquisitions resulted in the issuance of million shares of our common stock 
each of these transactions has been accounted for as a purchase  and  accordingly  results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in the consolidated statements of income from the date of purchase 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions 
in addition to the acquisitions  we completed the first phase of our expansion into the atlanta market 
through our alliance with kroger  we opened new in store branches 
during october  we announced plans which will expedite the expansion of our banking presence in the atlanta metropolitan area by entering into an agreement to purchase traditional branch facilities from wachovia and assume wachovia s lease obligations for seven additional branch buildings 
these branches complement our existing and planned in store branches and will give us the fifth largest branch presence in the atlanta metropolitan statistical area msa by the end of with approximately branches opened or under development 
this agreement with wachovia is expected to close in the first quarter of under the terms of the agreement  we are not permitted to commence operations in these branches until the fourth quarter of we are focusing our efforts on capturing a five percent share of atlanta s billion deposit market within five years 
the expansion to atlanta solidifies our geographic footprint  linking tennessee and the north georgia regions with the westernmost edge of our north and south carolina operations 
results of operations performance overview despite a challenging economy  our results exceeded s due to our focus on revenue growth and expense control while expanding our franchise through acquisitions and de novo expansion in atlanta 
net income in totaled million  a percent increase over s million 
basic and diluted earnings per share were and  respectively  compared to s and 
returns on average assets were percent in and percent in returns on average stockholders equity were percent and percent  respectively  for the years ended and the comparability of our results of operations during the three year period ended december  was significantly impacted by the ccb merger in july as only six months of its operations are included in our income but a full year of earnings are included in subsequent years 
comparisons between the years are also impacted by significant merger costs and other non recurring expenses recorded in  as discussed below 
net income in totaled million which equated to 
per diluted share in returns on average assets and average stockholders equity in were 
percent and percent  respectively 
items identified as non recurring were comprised of merger expense 
during  we recognized million of merger related expense related primarily to the acquisition of the wachovia branches 
in  we recognized million of merger related expense in connection with the acquisitions of two financial institutions and the wachovia branches 
in  we incurred million of merger related expense in connection with the ccbf merger and the acquisitions of piedmont and first mercantile  which expense included severance and other employee benefit costs  excess facilities costs and system conversion costs 
unrealized losses on interest rate swaps 
in  we recognized million of unrealized losses on interest rate swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting under statement no 
we entered into the swaps in the first half of the year during a rising interest rate environment 
by entering into these contracts  we reduced our interest rate sensitivity to wholesale funding 
when the rate environment changed in the latter half of  we incurred losses on the swaps which were recognized as a charge to earnings 
the swaps were terminated in the first quarter of goodwill amortization 
as further discussed under the heading other accounting matters  effective january  we adopted statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  goodwill associated with corporate acquisitions will no longer be amortized  but rather will be tested for impairment no less frequently than annually 
goodwill amortization totaled million in or 
per diluted share 
core deposit intangibles recorded in acquisitions will continue to be amortized over the estimated remaining life of the deposit base assumed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on ncf s intangible assets 
operating cash earnings we have made several acquisitions during the periods presented  the most significant of which was the july ccbf merger 
due to the significance of the intangible assets created from this merger and the merger related expenses of combining the two equal sized companies  management believes that operating cash earnings are an important measure in reviewing our performance as it better illustrates operating trends in our core businesses 
in addition  we have incurred certain other non recurring expenses as described in table below 
we monitor and evaluate our performance on both a gaap net income as well as on an operating cash basis 
operating cash earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap net income and earnings per share 
intangibles amortization and non recurring items excluded from net income to derive operating cash earnings may be significant and may not be comparable to other companies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the merger related expense 
excluding the non recurring items and amortization of intangibles  our diluted operating cash earnings per share totaled compared to s and operating cash returns on average tangible assets and average tangible equity were percent and percent  respectively  compared to s percent and percent

volume  yield cost and relative mix of both earning assets and interest bearing and noninterest bearing sources of funds impact net interest income 
the difference between earning asset yields with a taxable equivalent adjustment made to provide comparability between tax exempt and taxable income and the average rate paid for interest bearing funds is measured by the interest rate spread and net interest margin 
to combat recession fears and slowdowns in the economy  the federal reserve decreased the target federal funds rate during and during  the federal reserve decreased the target federal funds rate eleven times by a total of basis points 
in november  the federal reserve reduced the target federal funds rate by an additional basis points 
each time the federal reserve decreased the target federal funds rate  our banking subsidiaries lowered their prime lending rate to keep pace with the changes in funding costs 
the prime rates charged by our banking subsidiaries have fallen from percent at december  to percent by december  and to percent at december  our yield on interest earning assets has fallen due to these interest rate changes 
the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities correspondingly have decreased when repriced 
until mid  our balance sheet had historically been liability sensitive and in times of falling interest rates  the decrease in interest expense from the lower cost of interest bearing liabilities exceeded the decrease in interest income from the lower yield on earning assets 
consequently  our interest rate spread widened to percent in compared to s percent 
historically  the federal reserve has not increased interest rates until the national unemployment rate is on a sustained downward trend 
we anticipate a very slow paced recovery of the us economy with a gradual increase in interest rates beginning in the second half of see table for an analysis of the net interest margin 
the contribution of net free liabilities to the net interest margin computed as net interest margin less the interest rate spread fell to basis points in from s basis points 
despite the increase in our net free liabilities of approximately million  the contribution of net free liabilities to our net interest margin declined as a result of the significant decline in the average yield on our interest earning assets as discussed previously 
our asset liability management committee alco  which continually monitors our interest sensitivity and liquidity  restructured our balance sheet during to be more asset sensitive in anticipation that interest rates will rise in by mid  our balance sheet had been repositioned to be slightly asset sensitive 
based on its view of existing and expected market conditions  alco adopts strategies that are intended to optimize net interest income to the extent possible while minimizing the risk associated with changes in interest rates 
see table for an analysis of the impact of changes in volume and rate on our net interest margin 
the following analysis of average balances and net interest income is significantly impacted by the july acquisition of ccb 
ccb s average balances and net interest income are included for approximately one half year in and for the full year in and table average balances and net interest income analysis years ended december taxable equivalent basis in thousands average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate average balance interest average yield rate earning assets loans us treasury and us government agencies and corporations states and political subdivisions equity and other securities trading account securities federal funds sold and other short term investments time deposits in other banks total earning assets non earning assets cash and due from banks bank owned life insurance investment in first market bank premises and equipment goodwill core deposit intangibles all other assets  net total assets interest bearing liabilities savings and time deposits short term borrowed funds federal home loan bank advances trust preferred securities and long term debt total interest bearing liabilities other liabilities and stockholders equity demand deposits other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest income and net interest margin interest rate spread the taxable equivalent basis is computed using percent federal and applicable state tax rates in  and the average loan balances include non accruing loans 
the average balances for debt and equity securities exclude the effect of their mark to market adjustment  if any 
net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total earning assets 
interest rate spread equals the earning asset yield minus the interest bearing liability rate 
loans constituted percent of average earning assets during compared to percent during and percent during management anticipates continued moderate loan growth in average earning assets as a percentage of average tangible assets average total assets reduced by goodwill and core deposit intangibles has exceeded percent over the last three years 
deposits are our primary source of funding earning asset growth 
average core deposits total deposits reduced by jumbo and brokered deposits totaled billion in compared to billion in approximately billion of the core deposit growth was due to the branch acquisitions consummated in substantially all deposits originate within our banking subsidiaries market areas 
we use both short and long term borrowings to fund growth of earning assets in excess of deposit growth 
in addition  we have utilized short term borrowings to fund the assets acquired in the bancmortgage acquisition  predominately mortgage loans held for sale 
short term borrowings include federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and master notes 
long term borrowings include trust preferred securities  subordinated debt and fhlb advances

the rate volume variance for each category has been allocated on a consistent basis between rate and volume variances based on the percentage of the rate or volume variance to the sum of the absolute value of the two variances 
noninterest income and expense our levels of noninterest income are  and will continue to be  a significant factor in determining our financial success 
noninterest income as a percentage of total revenues taxable equivalent basis grew to percent in compared to s percent and s percent 
during  we experienced a percent increase in service charges on deposits due to higher volume of commercial accounts  the impact of lower interest rates in computing commercial service charges  increases in atm and check card usage  and increases in overdraft fees primarily due to higher volumes of consumer demand deposit accounts including acquired wachovia and first union accounts 
we review our service charge structure periodically to ensure that our charges are competitive with the marketplace 
as a result  we increased certain service charges during our financial enterprises segment generates a significant portion of our noninterest income 
this segment is comprised of our transaction processing  asset management  broker dealer and retail banking consulting businesses 
financial enterprises generated percent and percent of total noninterest income in and  respectively  compared to s percent 
asset management fees were stable in and at million 
performance was dampened by lower equity market valuations throughout managed and custodial assets totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the decline in total managed and custodial assets was due primarily to the weak equity market 
we are extending our wealth management programs throughout our ncf footprint with the goal of synchronizing private banking  trust  brokerage and first mercantile to provide complete wealth management solutions 
we anticipate moderately higher asset management revenues in as our strategy comes to fruition 
asset management fees totaled million in  the significant increase experienced in resulted from including the first mercantile and ccb trust businesses acquired in for a full year in income earned on bank owned life insurance  included in other noninterest income  increased million in due to higher levels of assets invested 
with our re entry into the mortgage secondary marketing business during  we began pooling our originated conforming mortgages and selling the loans in the secondary market to various agencies with servicing retained 
we then sold substantially all of the servicing rights to another company on a quarterly lag 
prior to the third quarter of  we sold the majority of our originated mortgages on a loan by loan basis to larger mortgage companies 
noninterest income includes income from mortgage banking activities of million in  million in and million in personnel expense is our largest noninterest expense 
we devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
with our sales oriented focus  more and more of our employee compensation plan is geared toward variable pay for high performance 
during  personnel expense increased million from the level primarily due to higher headcount in revenue related areas  including the acquisitions  and commissions paid for higher revenues in the mortgage and broker dealer businesses 
despite the dollar increase  personnel expense as a percentage of average tangible assets remained stable from s level at percent 
in  we expect our pension expense to increase by approximately million primarily due to lower investment returns over the last several years 
both occupancy and equipment expense increased in compared to due primarily to the wachovia and first union branches acquired 
all other operating expense increased million due primarily to increased telecommunications  data processing  marketing  regulatory and atm network expenses 
all of these categories were impacted by our larger branch network resulting from the wachovia and first union branch acquisition and expansion to the atlanta market 
additionally  our merchant processing expenses grew due to higher volume of participating merchants 
table presents a reconcilement of our gaap and operating cash efficiency ratios for the prior five years 
our overall efficiency ratio noninterest expense as a percentage of net interest income plus noninterest income on a gaap basis was percent  percent and percent for the years ending december   and  respectively 
the improvement in the ratio over the past two years is primarily attributable to declines in intangibles amortization and other unusual charges as shown in table excluding the items listed in table and computing on a taxable equivalent basis  our operating cash efficiency ratio was percent for and for  down from percent in we have been able to keep our expense growth in line with revenue growth while investing in our franchise through acquisition  de novo expansion in atlanta and upgrading technology

operating cash earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income and earnings per share as determined in accordance with gaap 
financial position loans loans are our largest category of earning assets and generate the highest yields 
loan growth and maintenance of a high quality loan portfolio are critical to our financial success 
we believe our strategy of lending to small to medium sized commercial customers and consumers allows a higher interest rate spread which helps support our net interest margin as well as limiting our credit losses 
table presents the year end breakdown of the major categories of the loan portfolio for the previous five years based upon regulatory classifications 
the acquisitions contributed over billion to outstanding loans 
table loan portfolio as of december in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer revolving credit lease financing total gross loans less unearned income total loans loans in the commercial  financial and agricultural category consist primarily of short term and or floating rate commercial loans made to small to medium sized companies 
there is no substantial loan concentration in any one industry or to any one borrower 
real estate construction loans are primarily made to commercial developers and residential contractors on a floating rate basis 
cash flow analyses for each project are the primary underwriting decision factor  with additional reliance upon collateral values 
we expect moderate growth in these categories during while maintaining our focus on high underwriting standards and credit quality 
real estate mortgage loans consist of loans secured by first or second deeds of trust on primary residences billion or percent of total real estate mortgage loans  multifamily residential properties and commercial properties 
our general policy is to sell to third party investors our current originations of fixed rate residential mortgages and retain only certain loans in the portfolio 
therefore  despite the significant increase in mortgage loan originations during due to lower interest rates  we had only limited growth in our portfolio and expect a modest decline in in the first lien residential mortgage segment 
however  in the second mortgage home equity line segment  we expect higher growth rates 
included within real estate mortgage loans are million and million  respectively  of loans held for sale at december  and the increase in loans held for sale is due to the change in how we sell these loans as described earlier and the acquisition of bancmortgage 
consumer loans consist primarily of loans secured by automobiles and other consumer personal property 
lending officers consider the customer s debt obligations  ability and willingness to repay and general economic trends in their decision to extend credit 
we anticipate continued declines in our consumer indirect lending portfolio having exited our affiliation with state farm during revolving credit includes overdraft protection and business credit card products 
we expect only moderate growth during in these products relative to total loans 
the leasing portfolio is not concentrated in any one line of business or type of equipment 
the portfolio has remained relatively flat since the ccb acquisition 
we do not anticipate significant growth in this portfolio during table maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates as of december  in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction total due in one year or less due after one year through five years fixed interest rates floating interest rates due after five years fixed interest rates floating interest rates total securities our securities portfolio consists primarily of debt securities issued by us government agencies and corporations 
many of these securities are structured mortgage securities allowing us to better control the timing of principal repayments and other securities containing call provisions 
we segregate debt and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values into one of three categories 
trading securities  exclusively from our institutional broker dealer business  totaled million at december  securities held to maturity totaled million  comprising percent of the total investment securities portfolio at december  at december   securities available for sale totaled billion  which represented percent of the total investment securities portfolio 
we do not currently anticipate selling a significant amount of the securities available for sale in the near future 
our average securities portfolio increased due to the first quarter acquisition of the wachovia branches which supplied us with a net inflow of approximately billion of securities available for sale 
with only moderate loan demand during  the securities received in the wachovia transaction were sold and reinvested in other investment securities that better fit our asset liability management needs 
see table for additional information about our investment securities portfolio 
the mark to market adjustment for available for sale securities totaled million in net unrealized gains at december  after considering applicable tax benefits  the mark to market adjustment resulted in a million increase to total stockholders equity 
future fluctuations in stockholders equity may occur due to changes in the market values of debt and equity securities classified as available for sale 
during late january  alco commenced a thorough review of a possible securitization involving to million of portfolio mortgage loans 
once securitized  it is anticipated that we would retain the majority of the newly created securities 
the proposed transaction would favorably impact our capital ratios and liquidity because the securities are more easily sold or pledged to secure borrowings 
as of mid february  we are reviewing the transaction structure and our loan portfolio to select individual assets for inclusion in the securitization 
while we are optimistic that a transaction could be structured and consummated during the first quarter of  there is a possibility that we will determine that the proposed transaction  including the terms of the securitization  does not achieve our desired results and objectives and therefore  may not be consummated

it is management s intention to increase this ratio to percent in the first half of regulatory capital bank holding companies are required to comply with the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines requiring a minimum leverage ratio relative to total assets and minimum capital ratios relative to risk adjusted assets 
the minimum leverage ratio is percent if the holding company has the highest regulatory rating and meets other requirements but the leverage ratio required may be raised from to basis points if the holding company does not meet these requirements 
the minimum risk adjusted capital ratios are percent for tier i capital and percent for total capital 
additionally  the federal reserve may set capital requirements higher than the minimums we have described for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it

each continues to maintain higher capital ratios than required under regulatory guidelines and all were considered to be well capitalized as of december  corporate risk profile managing the risks inherent in delivering financial services is essential for successful results 
our primary risks are credit  interest rate  market and liquidity 
credit risk is the risk of not collecting principal and interest on loans or investments when due 
interest rate risk is the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in interest rates 
market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates and other factors that may result in changes in the value of financial instruments that are accounted for on a mark to market basis  such as trading account securities 
liquidity risk is the possibility that we are unable to meet obligations to our depositors  shareholders or borrowers including deposit withdrawls  funding of loan commitments and payment of dividends 
credit risk management our credit risk management begins with our loan underwriting policies 
our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of secured credits with no significant borrower or industry concentration 
we have minimal shared national credit exposure and our only shared national credit exposure is to companies in our geographical market and those for which we have significant other business relationships 
substantially all loans are made on a secured basis with the exception of certain revolving credit accounts and are generally originated for retention in the portfolio  with the exception of marketable mortgage loans 
our lending officers generally consider the cash flow or earnings power of the borrower as the primary source of repayment 
in addition  as a secondary source of repayment  we look at the strength and liquidity of guarantors where appropriate 
our banks do not engage in highly leveraged transactions or foreign lending activities 
in evaluating loan credit risk  management considers changes  if any  in internal loan grades based on loan review  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  actual and projected credit quality trends including delinquency  charge off and bankruptcy rates and current economic conditions that may impact a borrower s ability to pay 
generally  the domestic economy was stagnant during while our credit review procedures are proactive and take into account changing economic conditions  we did an extensive review of our private aircraft lending portfolio during through our reviews and our follow up actions to minimize losses in this portfolio  we repossessed several airplanes  including million included in non performing assets at december   and charged off million of aircraft loans during the year 
allowance for loan losses management performs an analysis of the loan portfolio quarterly to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the overall allowance analysis considers the results of the loan reviews  quantitative and qualitative indicators of the current quality of the loan portfolio and the inherent risk not captured in the reviews and assessments of pools of loans 
management responsible for credit and financial matters perform the assessment and establish the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
our quarterly evaluation process provides for self correction through periodic adjustment of loss factors based on actual experience if unanticipated events are encountered with respect to an individual loan or within a group of credits 
the analysis of individual credit relationships is the first step in the evaluation process 
individual credit relationships in excess of  or with specific credit characteristics are evaluated for collectibility and for potential impairment by our independent loan review staff 
impaired loans are measured in accordance with gaap 
commercial  residential construction  small business and consumer loans not reviewed for impairment  or not considered impaired  are considered on a portfolio basis as the second step in the evaluation process 
these loans are evaluated as pools of loans based on payment status for the consumer portfolio and an internal credit risk grading system for commercial and small business loans 
an allowance is calculated for each consumer loan pool using loss factors based on a monthly analysis of delinquency trends and historical loss experience 
loss factors for the commercial and small business loan pools are based on average historical yearly loss experience 
various credit quality trends ie  internal grading changes  delinquencies  charge offs  nonaccruals  and criticized classified assets  which may impact portfolio performance  are also considered in determining the loss factors for each loan pool 
the third step in the evaluation process is the computation of an unallocated allowance  which is the portion of our overall allowance that is not allocated to particular loans or loan pools 
in computing our unallocated allowance  we consider numerous factors including industry  borrower or collateral concentrations  changes in lending policies and underwriting  current loan volumes  experience of our lending staff  current general economic data and conditions  fraud risk  and risk inherent in the loss estimation process for pools of loans 
table presents a summary of loss experience and the allowance for loan losses for the previous five years 
net charge offs in the five year period ended occurred primarily in the consumer loan portfolio 
with our conservative underwriting of primarily small to medium sized  secured loans  we have maintained low net charge off ratios in a challenging economic environment 
net charge offs and the provision for loan losses were impacted significantly by the july merger with ccb 
ccb s net charge offs and provision are included for the full years and and approximately one half of table summary of loan loss experience and the allowance for loan losses years ended december in thousands balance at beginning of year loan losses charged to allowance commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer revolving credit lease financing total loan losses charged to allowance recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer revolving credit lease financing total recoveries of loans previously charged off net charge offs provision charged to operations allowance related to acquisitions balance at end of year loans outstanding at end of year ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding at end of year coverage of allowance for loan losses to net charge offs x average loans outstanding ratio of net charge offs of loans to average loans ratio of recoveries to charge offs our provision for loan losses totaled million in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding was percent at the end of compared to percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
the ratio decrease was due in part to higher levels of mortgage loans held for sale which do not require the same level of allowance as loans held in the portfolio 
the ratio of the allowance to loans outstanding  excluding loans held for sale  was percent at december  and percent and percent  respectively  at december  and the allowance at year end provides for a coverage level of times s net charge offs 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans increased basis points in to 
percent 
the higher level of charge offs is due primarily to the private aircraft charge offs discussed previously  which also increased commercial  financial and agricultural charge offs 
a favorable trend in our loan mix  begun in  continued in whereby the loan segment with the highest losses historically  consumer loans  made up a smaller percentage of the total portfolio and two segments  real estate construction and real estate mortgage  which historically have had lower loss rates  made up a larger percentage of the portfolio 
see table for an analysis of the percentage of each loan segment to total loans 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the most recent regulatory agency examinations have not revealed any material problem credits that had not been previously identified  however  future regulatory examinations may result in the regulatory agencies requiring additions to the allowance for loan losses based on information available at the date of examination 
table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of the end of the previous five years 
the allocation is based on the regulatory classification of our portfolios  which focuses on the loan collateral  and differs from our internal classification  which focuses on the purpose of the loan 
ccb was merged into nbc on december  and loans held in ccb s portfolio percent of the total loan portfolio underwent their first office of the comptroller of currency occ bank examination during during that exam  occ examiners suggested refinements to the ccb risk scoring system which had been previously acceptable to ccb s former primary bank regulatory agency 
these refinements resulted in credit shifts from special mention to substandard for certain of the credit relationships reviewed 
in our model for computing allowance for loan losses  substandard credits are given a substantially higher risk factor which is partially based upon our evaluation of historical losses resulting from loans classified as substandard 
we have not re evaluated our loss factors to reflect the impact of shifting a larger number of credits to the substandard category 
consequently  we experienced a significant increase in the allocation of the allowance to specific loans 
management believes that the modification of credit classifications at the occ s request does not indicate deterioration of credit quality as much as different grading methodologies and highlights the need to re evaluate our loss factors utilized to allocate the allowance 
the loss factors used in our allowance allocation model will be re evaluated based upon the modified loan classification system 
this review will consider historical data  including loss levels and will potentially result in the revision of the loss factors utilized in allocating our allowance 
management anticipates that the revised risk factors may be lower than those used in the current allowance model and that the unallocated allowance may increase as a result

asset quality nonperforming assets at the end of each of the previous five years are presented in table ccb s nonperforming assets are not included prior to december  nonperforming assets have increased since december as a result of the economic conditions discussed earlier 
sixty seven percent of the nonaccrual loans are loans secured by real estate construction land development  one to four family residential properties and commercial real estate 
the next largest category of nonaccrual loans is commercial and industrial 
foreclosed real estate increased million due primarily to three commercial properties 
we anticipate no significant additional loss on these properties 
other repossessed assets increased primarily due to aircraft repossessions as discussed previously 
our ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was times at december  compared to times at december  the majority of accruing loans days or more past due are again the three categories of loans secured by real estate listed above 
consumer loans are the next largest category 
nonperforming assets are only one of several asset quality measures we analyze 
despite the increase throughout in these measures  our net charge offs remained low at 
percent of average loans in compared to 
percent in table nonperforming assets as of december in thousands nonaccrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans foreclosed real estate nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate other repossessed assets nonperforming assets accruing loans days or more past due ratio of nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate to loans outstanding and foreclosed real estate total assets ratio of nonperforming assets to loans outstanding plus foreclosed real estate and other repossessed assets total assets allowance for loan losses to total nonperforming loans x allowance for loan losses to total nonperforming assets our general policy is to place credits in a nonaccrual status when there are doubts regarding the collectibility of principal or interest or when payment of principal or interest is days or more past due unless determined that the collectibility is not reasonably considered in doubt 
loans are considered impaired if it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the terms of the loan agreement 
the value of the impaired loan is based on discounted cash flows or the fair value of the collateral for a collateral dependent loan 
any impairment losses are recognized through charges to the allowance for loan losses 
at december   impaired loans amounted to million  of which million were not accruing interest 
at december   these amounts were million and million  respectively 
the related allowance for loan losses on these loans amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
interest rate risk management we manage interest sensitivity so as to avoid significant net interest margin fluctuations while promoting consistent net income increases during periods of changing interest rates 
interest sensitivity is our primary market risk and is defined as the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in interest rates 
this risk of loss can be reflected in reduced potential net interest income in future periods 
the structure of our loan and deposit portfolios is such that a significant increase or decline in interest rates may adversely impact net interest income 
responsibility for managing interest rate  market and liquidity risks rests with the asset liability management committee alco comprised of senior management 
alco reviews interest rate and liquidity exposures and  based on its view of existing and expected market conditions  adopts balance sheet strategies that are intended to optimize net interest income to the extent possible while minimizing the risk associated with changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity varies with different types of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
overnight federal funds  on which rates change daily  and loans which are tied to the prime rate are much more interest rate sensitive than fixed rate securities and loans 
similarly  time deposits of  and over and money market accounts are much more interest rate sensitive than savings accounts 
the shorter term interest rate sensitivities are the key to measurement of the interest sensitivity gap  or difference between interest sensitive earning assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
trying to minimize this gap is a continual challenge in a changing interest rate environment and one of alco s objectives 
alco uses gap analysis as one method to determine and monitor the appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
gap analysis measures the interest sensitivity of assets and liabilities at a given point in time 
the interest sensitivity of assets and liabilities is based on the timing of contractual maturities and repricing opportunities 
a positive interest sensitive gap occurs when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities 
the reverse situation results in a negative gap 
management feels that an essentially balanced position percent of total earning assets between interest sensitive assets and liabilities is necessary in order to protect against wide fluctuations in interest rates 
an analysis of our interest sensitivity position at december  is presented in table at december   we had a cumulative positive gap interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities and interest rate swaps of million or percent of total tangible assets over a twelve month horizon 
the ratio of tangible assets to liabilities  tangible equity and interest rate swaps was x 
table interest sensitivity analysis as of december  in thousands days sensitive months sensitive months to year sensitive total sensitive beyond year sensitive total assets short term investments investment securities loans other assets total tangible assets liabilities noninterest dda savings deposits time deposits short term borrowed funds long term debt other liabilities total liabilities tangible equity total liabilities and tangible equity interest rate swaps pay floating receive fixed total interest rate swaps interest sensitivity gap cumulative gap cumulative ratio of tangible assets to liabilities  tangible equity and interest rate swaps x cumulative gap to total tangible assets assets and liabilities that mature in one year or less and or have interest rates that can be adjusted during this period are considered interest sensitive 
the interest sensitivity position has meaning only as of the date for which it is prepared 
gap analysis is a limited interest rate risk management tool because it does not incorporate the interrelationships between interest rates charged or paid  balance sheet trends and reaction to interest rate changes 
in addition  a gap analysis model does not consider that changes in interest rates do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
therefore  alco uses gap analysis as a tool to monitor changes in the balance sheet structure 
to estimate the impact that changes in interest rates would have on our earnings  alco uses simulation analysis 
alco prepares and reviews the simulation analysis quarterly 
the most recent simulation analysis was as of november  and those results do not vary significantly from those that would have been obtained for an analysis as of december  simulation analysis is performed using a computer based asset liability model incorporating current portfolio balances and rates  contractual maturities  repricing opportunities  and assumptions about prepayments  future interest rates  and future volumes 
using this information  the model calculates earnings estimates under multiple interest rate scenarios 
to measure the sensitivity of our earnings  the results of multiple simulations  which assume changes in interest rates  are compared to the base case simulation  which assumes no changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity of earnings is expressed as a percentage change in comparison to the base case simulation 
the model assumes an immediate parallel shift in the interest rate environment 
using data as of november   a basis point increase is projected to increase net income percent and a basis point decrease is projected to decrease net income percent 
as mentioned earlier  we have restructured our balance sheet to lessen our exposure to interest rate increases 
at december   simulation analysis projected a percent decrease in net income with a basis point increase and a percent decrease with a basis point decrease 
the model s december  projection of decreased net income  whether interest rates rise or fall  is due to asymmetrical pricing assumptions and call risk 
the model uses asymmetrical pricing assumptions with certain borrowings whereby interest rates are assumed not to be able to fall as much as they are able to rise a floor is established but no ceiling 
with call risk  in a falling interest rate environment  issuer calls of higher yielding securities produce excess cash that would be re invested at the lower rates available in the market 
in a rising rate environment  maturities of lower yielding callable securities are extended and less cash is generated for re investment at the higher market rates available 
as of december   management believes that ncf is positioned to avoid material negative changes in net income resulting from future changes in interest rates 
management continues to target a relatively neutral position relative to future interest rate increases as it believes interest rate increases will begin in the second half of if simulation results show that earnings sensitivity exceeds the targeted limit  alco will adopt on balance sheet and or off balance sheet strategies to bring earnings sensitivity within target guidelines 
management uses both on and off balance sheet strategies to manage the balance sheet 
alco reviews the interest earning and interest bearing portfolios to ensure a proper mix of fixed and variable rate products 
emphasis will continue to be placed on granting loans with short maturities and floating rates where possible 
estimating the amount of interest rate risk requires using assumptions about the future 
these estimates will be different from actual results for many reasons  including but not limited to  changes in the growth of the overall economy  changes in credit spreads  market interest rates moving in patterns other than the patterns chosen for analysis  changes in customer preferences  changes in tactical and strategic plans and changes in federal reserve policy 
stress testing is performed on all market risk measurement analyses to help understand the relative sensitivity of key assumptions and thereby better understand our risk profile 
management will continue to monitor our interest sensitivity position with the goals of ensuring adequate liquidity while at the same time seeking profitable spreads between the yields on funding uses and the rates paid for funding sources 
market risk management market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the value of financial instruments that are accounted for on a mark to market basis  such as trading account securities 
ncf s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
ncf utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity and market risk by modifying the repricing or maturity of assets or liabilities 
by their nature  derivative instruments are subject to market risk 
we do not utilize derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
all interest rate derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded at fair values as other assets or other liabilities on the balance sheet and are designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges 
as of december   we had derivative financial instruments in the form of fair value hedges related to the trust preferred securities issued in the notional amount of the hedge is million 
notional amounts do not represent amounts to be exchanged between parties and are not a measure of financial risks  but only provide the basis for calculating interest payments between the counterparties 
net interest received or paid on an interest rate swap agreement is recognized over the life of the contract as an adjustment to interest income expense of the modified or hedged financial asset or liability 
table provides information about our financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  principal cash flow and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities for loans  securities and liabilities with contractual maturities are presented 
we included assumptions of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on prepayment of residential and home equity loans and mortgage backed securities based on our historical experience 
for core deposits that have no contractual maturity  the principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates presented are based upon our historical experience  management s judgment and statistical analysis  as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
weighted average variable rates are based on the implied forward rates in the yield curve at december  liquidity risk management liquidity ensures that adequate funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals  fund loan and capital expenditure commitments  maintain reserve requirements  pay operating expenses  provide funds for dividends  debt service and other commitments and operate the organization on an ongoing basis 
funds are primarily provided by our banking subsidiaries through cash flows from operating activities  expansion of the deposit base  borrowing funds in money market operations and through the sale or maturity of assets 
net cash provided by operating activities and deposits from customers have been our primary sources of liquidity 
correspondent relationships are maintained with several larger banks enabling our banking subsidiaries to purchase federal funds when needed 
also available as liquidity sources are access to the federal reserve discount window and lines of credit our subsidiary banks maintain with the fhlb 
these lines of credit are secured by blanket collateral agreements on the mortgage loan portfolios and certain other loans and securities held by our banking subsidiaries

the parent company s liquidity is provided though cash dividends from its banking and other non bank subsidiaries as well as its capacity to raise additional borrowed funds as needed 
additionally  the parent company has a million unsecured line of credit with a commercial bank available as needed 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various off balance sheet commitments and other arrangements to extend credit 
at december   we had commitments to extend credit totaling billion 
these amounts include unused home equity lines and commercial real estate  construction and land development commitments of billion and million  respectively  at december  standby letters of credit are commitments issued by our banking subsidiaries to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
non depreciable assets generally secure the standby letters of credit 
our banking subsidiaries had approximately million in outstanding standby letters of credit at december  since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
these commitments expose us to the risk of deteriorating credit quality of borrowers to whom a commitment to extend credit has been made  however  no significant credit losses are expected from these commitments and arrangements 
in addition to our commitments to extend credit to customers  we have noncancellable  long term lease commitments totaling million at december  our institutional broker dealer and secondary mortgage marketing operations enter into transactions involving financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in order to meet the financing and hedging needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the contract amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement in particular classes of financial instruments 
risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities market values and interest rates 
at december   forward contracts for commitments to purchase investment securities totaled million and commitments to sell totaled million 
when issued contracts for commitments to purchase investment securities totaled million and commitments to purchase totaled million at december  forward commitments to sell mortgages totaled million at december  management believes that it has adequate resources available to manage our liquidity needs 
other accounting matters in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the provisions of statement no 
 goodwill and identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization 
rather they are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
identified intangible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over that life in a manner that reflects the estimated decline in the economic value of the identified intangible asset and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
we adopted the provisions of statement on january  under its provisions  all amortization of goodwill and identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives ceased effective january   on a prospective basis 
also under statement  all goodwill and identified intangible assets with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment as of january   and annually thereafter 
this test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities  identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  a further test is required to measure the amount of goodwill impairment
