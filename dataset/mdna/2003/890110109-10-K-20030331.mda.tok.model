consumer and other loans were million at december   down from million at december  the lease portfolio increased by to million at december  from million at december  the lease portfolio has traditionally consisted of leases on vehicles for consumers and small businesses 
competition for automobile financing has led to a decline in the consumer lease portfolio over the past several years

the reserve for loan lease losses management reviews the adequacy of the reserve for loan lease losses reserve on a regular basis 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the reserve to be a critical accounting policy  given the inherent uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the reserve required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that assumption could have on the results of operations 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the reserve and the related provision include management s approach to granting new credit  the ongoing monitoring of existing credits by the internal and external loan review functions  the growth and composition of the loan lease portfolio  comments received during the course of independent examinations  current local economic conditions  past due and nonperforming loan statistics  the estimated values of collateral  and a historical review of loan lease loss experience 
based upon consideration of the above factors  management believes that the reserve is adequate to provide for the risk of loss inherent in the current loan lease portfolio 
management uses a model to measure some of these factors and the resulting quantitative analysis  combined with qualitative assessments  comprise the basis on which the adequacy of the reserve is determined 
the  increase in the reserve between december  and december  resulted from the provision for loan lease losses exceeding the net loan losses for the year 
the allocation of the company s reserve as of december   and each of the previous four year ends is illustrated in table table allocation of the reserve for loan lease losses december dollar amounts in thousands total loans outstanding at end of year      allocation of the reserve by loan type commercial      real estate      consumer and all other      unallocated     total      allocation of the reserve as a percentage of total reserve commercial real estate consumer and all other unallocated total loan lease types as a percentage of total loans leases commercial real estate consumer and all other total loans days past due and accruing  nonaccrual loans      troubled debt restructurings not included above total nonperforming loans leases      other real estate owned total nonperforming assets      reserve as a percentage of loans leases outstanding reserve as a percentage of nonperforming loans leases the reserve represented of total loans leases outstanding at december   down slightly from at december  the reserve coverage of nonperforming loans loans past due days and accruing  nonaccrual loans  and restructured troubled debt improved to times at december   compared to times at december  management is committed to early recognition of loan problems and to maintaining an adequate reserve 
the above allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge offs may occur  nor is it an indicator of future loss trends 
the allocation of the reserve to each category does not restrict the use of the reserve to absorb losses in any category

management considers loans leases classified as substandard  which continue to accrue interest  to be potential problem loans leases 
at december   the company  through its internal loan review function has identified commercial relationships totaling million  which it has classified as substandard  which continue to accrue interest 
these loans remain in a performing status due to a variety of factors  including payment history  the value of collateral supporting the credits  and personal or government guarantees 
these factors  when considered in aggregate  give management reason to believe that the current risk exposure on these loans is not significant 
approximately million of these loans are backed by guarantees of us government agencies 
while in a performing status as of december   these loans exhibit certain risk factors  which have the potential to cause them to become nonperforming 
accordingly  management s attention is focused on these credits  which are reviewed on at least a quarterly basis 
deposits and other liabilities total deposits of billion at december   reflected an increase of million over total deposits at december  deposit growth consisted primarily of core deposits  which increased by million  while time deposits of  or more decreased by million 
core deposit growth was fairly strong at all of the company s subsidiary banks and included growth in mature offices as well as newer offices 
offices opened after january   contributed million to the growth in  while the remaining million of growth was in offices opened prior to january  the company s liability for securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements amounted to million at december   representing a million decrease over december  the company uses both retail and wholesale repurchase agreements 
retail repurchase agreements are arrangements with local customers of the company  in which the company agrees to sell securities to the customer with an agreement to repurchase those securities at a specified later date 
retail repurchase agreements totaled million at december   and million at december  management generally views local repurchase agreements as an alternative to large time deposits 
the company s wholesale repurchase agreements are with the federal home loan bank fhlb and amounted to million at december  and million at december  the company s other borrowings represent amounts owed to the fhlb 
during  the company increased its other borrowings from the fhlb by million  to million 
borrowings with the fhlb outstanding at december   included million due in one year or less  and million due in more than one year 
the weighted average interest rate on other borrowings due in more than one year was at december  liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of adequate funding sources to satisfy the demand for credit  deposit withdrawals  and business investment opportunities 
the company s large  stable core deposit base and strong capital position are the foundation for the company s liquidity position 
asset and liability positions are monitored primarily through asset liability management committees of the subsidiary banks individually and on a combined basis 
these committees review periodic reports on the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity positions 
comparisons with industry and peer groups are also monitored 
the company s strong reputation in the communities it serves  along with its strong financial condition  provide access to numerous sources of liquidity as described below 
management believes these diverse liquidity sources provide sufficient means to meet all demands on the company s liquidity that are reasonably likely to occur 
core deposits remain the key funding source  representing of total deposits  and of total liabilities at december  non core funding sources time deposits of  or more  brokered time deposits  municipal money market accounts repurchase agreements  and other borrowings increased as a percentage of total liabilities from at december   to at december  short term investments  consisting of securities with maturities of one year or less increased from million at december   to million at december  non core funding sources may require securities to be pledged against the underlying liability 
at december   securities pledged to secure certain large deposits  repurchase agreements  and other borrowings amounted to million  compared to million at december  total securities pledged for deposits and repurchase agreements represented of total securities at december   compared to of total securities at december  the company s liquidity is enhanced by ready access to national and regional wholesale funding sources including federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  negotiable certificates of deposit  and fhlb advances 
through its subsidiary banks  the company has borrowing relationships with the fhlb and correspondent banks  which provide secured and unsecured borrowing capacity 
at december   the unused borrowing capacity on established lines with the fhlb was million 
as members of the fhlb  the company s subsidiary banks can use unencumbered mortgage related assets to secure additional borrowings from the fhlb 
at december   total unencumbered residential real estate assets were million 
additional assets may also qualify as collateral for fhlb advances upon approval of the fhlb 
cash flow from the loan and investment portfolios provides a significant source of liquidity 
these assets may have stated maturities in excess of one year  but have monthly principal reductions 
total mortgage backed securities  at fair value  increased from million at december   to million at december  using current prepayment assumptions  cash flow from the investment portfolio is estimated to be approximately million in investments in residential mortgage loans  consumer loans  and leases totaled approximately million at december  aggregate amortization from monthly payments on these loan assets provides significant additional cash flow to the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk the company s primary market risk exposure relates to sensitivity to interest rate changes 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the volatility in earnings resulting from changes in interest rates 
each quarter  or more frequently if necessary  the asset liability management committees estimate the earnings impact of changes in interest rates 
the findings of the committees are incorporated into investment and funding decisions  and in the business planning process 
table is a condensed static gap report  which illustrates the anticipated repricing intervals of assets and liabilities as of december  the analysis reflects a relatively balanced position with some short term sensitivity to rising interest rates in the month repricing interval followed by longer term asset sensitivity in the month repricing intervals 
this analysis suggests that the company s net interest income is more vulnerable to a sustained low interest rate environment than it is to rising interest rates 
table interest rate risk analysis condensed static gap december  repricing interval cumulative dollar amounts in thousands total months months months months interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities      net gap position     net gap position as a percentage of total assets balances of available for sale securities are shown at amortized cost 
the company s board of directors has set a policy that interest rate risk exposure will remain within a range whereby net interest income will not decline by more than in one year as a result of a basis point change in rates 
based upon the simulation analysis performed as of december   a basis point upward shift in interest rates over a one year time frame would result in a one year decline from the base case scenario  which assumes interest rates remain at current levels  of approximately in net interest income  and management takes no action to address balance sheet mismatches 
the same simulation indicates that a basis point decline in interest rates over a one year period would result in a decrease in net interest income of  when compared to the base case 
although the simulation model suggests relatively modest exposure to changes in interest rates  the base case scenario which assumes interest rates remain at current levels indicates a downward trending net interest margin due to more assets repricing in the current low rate environment than liabilities 
given the expectation of a lower net interest margin in  maintaining net interest income in at the amount realized in will depend upon continued growth in earnings assets 
the simulation model is useful in identifying potential exposure to interest rate movements  however  management feels that certain actions could be taken to offset some of the negative effects of unfavorable movements in interest rates
