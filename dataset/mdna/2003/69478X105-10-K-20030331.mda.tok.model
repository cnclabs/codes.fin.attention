item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary the principal business of the bank is attracting retail deposits from consumers and small businesses and investing those deposits together with funds generated from operations and borrowings  primarily in income property real estate secured loans and residential secured construction loans 
the bank commenced originating and purchasing income property real estate secured loans through a network of mortgage brokers located within the state of california in in  the bank will fund substantially all of the loans that it originates or purchases through its excess liquidity  deposits  fhlb advances and internally generated funds 
deposit flows and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates of interest primarily on competing investments  account maturities and the levels of savings in the bank s market area 
the bank s ability to originate and purchase loans is influenced by the general level of product available 
the bank s results of operations are also affected by the bank s provision for loan losses and the level of operating expenses 
the bank s operating expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits  premises and occupancy expenses  and other general expenses 
the company s results of operations are also affected by prevailing economic conditions  competition  government policies and other actions of regulatory agencies 
see item business 
additionally  all share and per share amounts in the accompanying financial statements and notes have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split that occurred on june  critical accounting policies management has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions management uses are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at balance sheet dates and the company s results of operations for future reporting periods 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses  the method for recognition of income on the participation contract  and the valuation allowance on deferred taxes are the critical accounting policies that require estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the company s financial statements that are most susceptible to significant change

at that time  a lower of cost or market adjustment of  was recorded as a charge off against the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income loss noninterest income was million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  this million increase is primarily due to a lower of cost or market adjustment in of million against the held for sale loan portfolio to adjust the value to the lower of cost or market and losses from the sale of loans in as a result of the company s exit from mortgage banking

mortgage servicing rights were  at december   compared to million at december  liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are principal and interest payments on loans and deposits and fhlb advances 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
however  the company believes it has continued to maintain at least the required minimum level of liquid assets to assure a safe and sound operation 
the bank s average liquidity ratios were   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see item regulation federal savings institution regulation liquidity 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
cash flows provided by used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of the positive net income of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  net cash provided by used in investing activities was  and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by investing activities is primarily a result of an increase of million in the purchase of securities  partially offset by an increase of million in proceeds from the sale of investment securities  as well as an increase of million in the purchase and loan origination of loans held for investment 
net cash used in financing activities were million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease of million was primarily due to the issuance of the million senior secured note  the proceeds of million from fhlb advances in as well as repayment of the fhlb advances of million  and a reduction in deposit accounts of million 
the company s most liquid assets are unrestricted cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and short term investments totaled million 
the company has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises  including the utilization of federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
at december   the bank had million outstanding advances from the fhlb 
effective january   the bank had access of up to of its assets in fhlb advances 
the ots capital regulations require savings institutions to meet three minimum capital requirements a tangible capital ratio  a leverage core capital ratio  and an risk based capital ratio 
the core capital requirement has been effectively increased to because the prompt corrective action legislation provides that institutions with less than core capital will be deemed undercapitalized 
in addition  the ots  under the prompt corrective action regulation  can impose various constraints on institutions depending on their level of capitalization ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized 
see item regulation federal savings institution regulation capital requirements 
the company had no material contractual obligations or commitments for capital expenditures at december  at december   the company had million outstanding commitments to originate or purchase mortgage loans compared to million at december  the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current and anticipated loan origination commitments 
certificates of deposit  which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december   totaled million 
the company expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be retained by the company at maturity 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  effective starting with fiscal years beginning after december  this standard establishes new accounting standards for goodwill and continues to require the recognition of goodwill as an asset but does not permit amortization of goodwill as previously required by the accounting principles board opinion apb opinion no 
the standard also establishes a new method of testing goodwill for impairment 
it requires goodwill to be separately tested for impairment at a reporting unit level 
the amount of goodwill determined to be impaired would be expensed to current operations 
management believes that the adoption of the statement will not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reporting containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  because the company accounts for the compensation cost associated with its stock option plans under the intrinsic value method  the alternative methods of transition will not apply to the company 
the additional disclosure requirements of the statement are included in these financial statements 
in management s opinion  the adoption of this statement would not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business 
if any of the events described in the following risk factors occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the events described in these risks 
the company may incur losses 
the company incurred net income of million and a net loss of million for the years ended december  and  respectively and may incur losses in the future 
the company may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
the failure to remain profitable may reduce the value of investment in its common stock 
the estimation of the future cash flows of the participation contract may fluctuate 
based on the company s analysis of the expected default rates and prepayment speeds of the underlying loans  the total cash to the company as of december  is expected to be approximately million over years 
due to changing market conditions and other unforeseen events beyond the company s control  the actual default and prepayment speeds may vary considerably  thus changing the amount of cash proceeds received from the underlying loans 
the company will require additional resources to repay the senior secured notes 
the company issued  of senior secured notes in january the senior secured notes are secured by all of the outstanding stock of the bank and the participation contract 
the company prepaid all of the interest on the senior secured notes from issuance through march  beginning june   interest only on the senior secured notes will be due quarterly 
the interest rate on the notes is per annum for  escalating to in  in and in the current quarterly interest payment is  all principal is due on january   but principal may be prepaid at the option of the company in whole or in part 
interest payments made to date have been funded by payments received by the company on the participation contract  totaling million in the company will be dependent on the participation contract to generate sufficient cash flow to make interest payments on the senior secured notes 
the bank is not in a position to make dividend payments to the company and has no plans to do such for the foreseeable future 
the cash flows available from the participation contract may vary considerably from those projected by the company 
should payments on the participation contract not be sufficient to service the senior secured notes and dividends not be available from the bank  the company will be required to obtain additional resources to service such debt 
no assurance can be given that the additional resources necessary to service or refinance the senior secured notes will be available in the capital markets 
failure to implement the strategic plan could adversely affect the operations 
the strategic plan is to transform the bank from an institution whose operations consist primarily of originating and selling residential mortgage loans to borrowers with sub prime credit and high loan to value loans  to a community based banking institution 
as part of this plan  the company has refocused on retail deposit taking and originating higher credit quality and larger balance real estate mortgage loans secured by income properties and loans for the construction of individual and small in fill tracts of residences for our portfolio 
the financial position and results of operations depend on the ability to successfully implement the strategic plan 
the failure to implement the strategic plan could harm the business and harm the results of operations 
competition can take many forms  including convenience in obtaining a loan  service  marketing and distribution channels and interest rates 
during periods of rising rates  competitors who have locked in low borrowing costs may have a competitive advantage 
during periods of declining rates  competitors may solicit the company s borrowers to refinance their loans 
during economic slowdowns or recessions  the bank s borrowers may have financial difficulties and may be receptive to offers by the bank s competitors 
in addition  the company faces increasing competition for deposits and other financial products from non bank institutions such as brokerage firms and insurance companies in such areas as short term money market funds  corporate and government securities funds  mutual funds and annuities 
in order to compete with these other institutions with respect to deposits and fee services  the company relies principally upon local promotional activities  personal relationships established by officers  directors and employees of the company and specialized services tailored to meet the individual needs of the company s customers 
loans to borrowers with sub prime credit involve a higher risk of default 
sub prime loans are loans to borrowers who generally do not satisfy the credit or underwriting standards prescribed by conventional mortgage lenders and loan buyers  such as fannie mae and freddie mac 
the bank s primary determinate in identifying sub prime loans from a or prime credit quality loans had been based solely on the borrower s credit rating known as a fair  isaac company fico credit score 
all loans to borrowers who possess a fico credit score of or less had been considered sub prime 
during the bank hired an internal asset review manager to oversee the bank s internal asset review iar function 
during the fourth quarter of the iar manager conducted an analysis of the bank s one to four unit residential loan portfolio related to historic delinquency  migration of delinquent loans to real estate owned reo and loss rates on loans on a state by state basis 
the conclusion of the analysis was that certain loans with fico scores as high as should be designated sub prime  namely loans in certain states in the southeast and central portion of the united states and certain loans with fico credit scores of and less should be designated as sub prime  namely those loans in certain western states 
based on the conclusion of the analysis the bank had million of sub prime loans at december  while the bank believes that the underwriting procedures and appraisal processes employed enabled the bank to somewhat reduce the risks inherent in loans made to these borrowers  the bank cannot assure you that such procedures or processes will afford adequate protection against such risks 
loans that are not fully secured involve a higher risk of loss 
the bank no longer originates high loan to value real estate secured loans  where the amount of the loan  together with more senior loans secured by the real estate  exceeds the value of the real estate 
however  at december   the bank still owned million of these loans  which represented of total assets 
in the event of a default on such a loan by a borrower  there generally would be insufficient collateral to pay off the balance of the loan and  as holder of a second position on the property  the company would likely lose all or a substantial portion of its investment 
investing in loans in states other than california may expose the company to unfamiliar laws and market risks 
in addition to lending activity in california  the bank has originated or purchased a significant number of one to four family residential mortgage loans on a nationwide basis through a network of originators 
there are risks involved in investing in loans on properties located throughout the nation  including some of the properties securing loans may be located in states which are experiencing adverse economic conditions  including a general softening in real estate markets and the local economies  which may result in increased loan delinquencies and loan losses  and regulations and practices regarding the liquidation of properties eg  foreclosure and the rights of mortgagors in default vary greatly from state to state  and these restrictions may limit the bank s ability to foreclose on a property or seek other recovery 
risks related to factors outside the company s control  including interest rate fluctuations  could harm profitability 
the company s profitability depends to a large extent upon net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
any change in general market interest rates  whether as a result of changes in the monetary policy of the federal reserve or otherwise  may have a significant effect on net interest income 
the assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management 
if interest rates rise  the company anticipates that its net interest income would decline  as interest paid on its deposits would increase more quickly than the interest earned on its assets 
moreover  in periods of rising interest rates  financial institutions typically originate fewer mortgage loans 
if interest rates decline  the bank s loans may be refinanced at lower rates or paid off and its investments may be prepaid earlier than expected 
if that occurs  the bank may have to redeploy the loan or investment proceeds into lower yielding assets  which might also decrease the company s income 
we may be unable to successfully compete in our industry 
the bank s operating results and its growth prospects are most directly and materially influenced by the health and vibrancy of the united states real estate markets  and the underlying economic forces which affect such markets  the overall complexion of the interest rate environment  including the absolute level of market interest rates and the volatility of such rates  the prominence of competitive forces which provide customers  or potential customers  of the company with alternative sources of deposits and mortgage funds or investments which compete with the company s products and services  and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities  including those of the ots  the fdic and the frb 
the company s success in identifying trends in each of these factors  and implementing strategies to exploit such trends  strongly influence the company s long term results and growth prospects 
the bank s income property and construction lending businesses are subject to intense local competition from larger banking companies  community banks  and thrift institutions 
poor economic conditions in our market areas may cause us to suffer higher default rates on our loans 
a substantial majority of our assets and deposits are generated in southern california 
as a result  poor economic conditions in southern california could cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio 
the united states entered into an economic recession in  and southern california was also impacted 
in addition  the war with iraq could have a significant negative effect on the national economy 
if current recessionary conditions continue or deteriorate  we expect that our level of non performing assets could increase 
concentrations of real estate loans could subject us to increased risks in the event of a real estate recession or natural disaster 
our loan portfolio consists almost entirely of real estate loans 
in the early s  the entire state of california experienced an economic recession that particularly impacted real estate values and resulted in increases in the level of delinquencies and losses for many financial institutions 
if a similar real estate recession affects our market areas in the future  the security for many of our loans could be reduced in value and the ability of some of our borrowers to pay could decline 
similarly  the occurrence of a natural disaster like those california has experienced in the past  including earthquakes  brush fires  and flooding could impair the value of the collateral we hold for real estate secured loans and negatively impact our results of operations 
we may experience loan losses in excess of our allowance for loan losses 
we try to limit the risk that borrowers will fail to repay loans by carefully underwriting the loans  nevertheless losses can and do occur 
we create an allowance for estimated loan losses in our accounting records  based on estimates of the following industry standards  historical experience with our loans  evaluation of economic conditions  regular reviews of the quality mix and size of the overall loan portfolio  regular reviews of delinquencies  and the quality of the collateral underlying our loans 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb any specifically identified losses as well as any other losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
however  changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  that are beyond our control  may cause our actual loan losses to exceed our current allowance estimates 
if the actual loan losses exceed the amount reserved  it will hurt our business 
in addition  the ots  as part of its supervisory function  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
such agency may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan losses  based on their judgments  which may be different from those of our management 
any increase in the allowance required by the ots could also hurt our business 
upon exercise of the warrant shareholders will experience significant dilution in their shares of common stock 
the holder of the warrant has the right to purchase  shares of the corporation s common stock at an exercise price of 
per share  which shares  once exercised  would represent approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of the company 
the trading price of the corporation s common stock has been significantly higher than 
per share for the last two fiscal years and at march   the closing price of the common stock was per share 
upon exercise of the warrant  existing shareholders will experience significant dilution of the shares of common stock which they hold 
you may have difficulty selling your shares in the future if a more active trading market in our common stock does not develop and if the warrant is issued 
although our common stock is traded on the nasdaq small cap market  trading in our common stock has not been extensive and cannot be characterized as amounting to an active trading market 
further  following the exercise of the warrant  an additional  shares of the company s stock will be issued and outstanding and will be eligible for sale in the public market upon registration thereof under the securities act of  as amended 
the availability of sale  as well as actual sale  of shares exercisable upon the exercise of the warrant would likely depress the market price of the common stock 
adverse outcomes of litigation against the company could harm its business and results of operation 
as a result of the consumer oriented nature of the industry in which it operates and uncertainties with respect to the application of various laws and regulations in some circumstances  industry participants are named from time to time as defendants in litigation  including class action suits  involving alleged violations of federal and state consumer lending or other similar laws and regulations 
a significant judgment against the bank in connection with any litigation could harm its business and results of operations 
see legal proceedings 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate risk management 
the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of appropriate risk given the company s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines through the establishment of prudent asset and liability concentration guidelines 
through such management  the management of the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates 
management of the company monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
the bank s board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis the bank s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the bank s capital of various interest rate scenarios 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
net portfolio value 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model which estimates the change in net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
a npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline the sensitivity measure 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure is  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the bank utilizes a market value model prepared by the ots the ots npv model  which is prepared quarterly  based on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports filed with the ots 
the ots npv model measures the bank s interest rate risk by estimating the bank s npv  which is the net present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and any off balance sheet contracts  under various market interest rate scenarios which range from a basis point increase to a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
the ots has incorporated an interest rate risk component into its regulatory capital rule 
under the rule  an institution whose sensitivity measure in the event of a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates exceeds would be required to deduct an interest rate risk component in calculating its total capital for purpose of the risk based capital requirement 
the ots has postponed indefinitely the date the component will first be deducted from an institution s total capital

this would correspondingly result in a thousand and million reduction in the npv of the bank

certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv requires the making of certain assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the models assume that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured 
second  the models assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the impact of the bank s business or strategic plans on the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
selected assets and liabilities which are interest rate sensitive 
the following table provides information regarding the bank s primary categories of assets and liabilities which are sensitive to changes in interest rates for the years ended december  and the information presented reflects the expected cash flows of the primary categories by year including the related weighted average interest rate 
the cash flows for loans are based on maturity and re pricing date 
the loans and mortgage backed securities which have adjustable rate features are presented in accordance with their next interest repricing date 
cash flow information on interest bearing liabilities such as passbooks  now accounts and money market accounts also is adjusted for expected decay rates  which are based on historical information 
also  for purposes of cash flow presentation  premiums or discounts on purchased assets  and mark to market adjustments are excluded from the amounts presented 
all certificates of deposit and borrowings are presented by maturity date

the bank does not have any foreign exchange exposure or any commodity exposure and therefore does not have any market risk exposure for these issues
