for the fiscal year ended september   sales for the industrial segment were  and for the water treatment segment were  the decrease in sales for the six month transitional period ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  was due to the difference in length of periods compared and to the seasonal nature of the water treatment segment s business as mentioned above 
for the fiscal year ended september   sales increased  a increase from the fiscal year ended october   due to an increase of  or  in industrial segment sales and an increase of  or  in water treatment segment sales 
the industrial segment increase was mainly due to an increase in the selling price of caustic soda and volume increases in other product lines  which were partially offset by a decrease in the volume of caustic soda sold 
the water treatment segment increase is due mainly to an increase in volumes of products sold 
gross margin gross margin  as a percentage of sales  was for the fiscal year ended march  compared to for the six month transitional period ended march  and was and for the fiscal years ended september  and october   respectively 
the gross margin variations are due to a number of variables as explained below 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the industrial segment was for the fiscal year ended march  and for the six month transitional period ended march  and was and for the fiscal years ended september  and october   respectively 
the increases over the previous year in the fiscal year ended march  and the six month transitional period ended march  are mainly due to improved margins in most product lines and to fluctuations in the cost and selling price of caustic soda 
during calendar  the cost of caustic soda was increasing and continued to increase through the end of the fiscal year 
due to the large quantities of caustic soda inventory that are maintained to meet customer requirements and because the company is on the last in  first out lifo method of valuing inventories  any cost fluctuations can impact gross margins 
the company attempts to maintain relatively constant dollar margins as the cost of caustic soda increases or decreases 
the cost of this product is normally subject to fluctuations  which are expected to continue in future periods 
by maintaining relatively stable dollar margins  the gross margin percentage will decrease when the cost of the product is increasing and will increase when the cost of the product is decreasing 
the company has generally been able to  and expects to continue to  adjust its selling price as the cost of materials and other expenses change 
the decrease in gross margin for the fiscal year ended september  compared to the fiscal year ended october  was primarily due to the cost of caustic soda  which began to increase at the beginning of fiscal year but then started to decrease and continued to decrease through the end of the fiscal year 
due to the large quantities of caustic soda that the company had on hand at the beginning of fiscal and because of the lifo method of valuing inventories  this increase negatively impacted gross margins 
the company implemented caustic soda price increases during the year  however  market pressures prevented the company from recovering all of the increased caustic soda costs 
additionally  an increase over the prior year in the volume of caustic soda in the year end inventory combined with the increase in cost of caustic soda resulted in an increase in the lifo reserve  all of which negatively affected earnings by million or 
per share 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the water treatment segment was for the fiscal year ended march   for the six month transitional period ended march   and and for the fiscal years ended september  and october   respectively 
the gross margin increase for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the six month transitional period ended march  was due to the fiscal year end change and to the nature of the water treatment segment business

additionally  there are certain fixed costs included in cost of sales that do not fluctuate with sales volumes 
the decrease for the six month transitional period ended march  in comparison to the fiscal year ended september  was due to the aforementioned fiscal year end change and the seasonality of the water treatment segment

selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  were for the fiscal year ended march   for the six month transitional period ended march   and and for the fiscal years ended september  and october   respectively 
the increase for the fiscal year ended march  over the six month transitional period ended march  was primarily attributable to the company s investment in infrastructure necessary to support future sales increases as well as a larger  more geographically dispersed organization 
the six month transitional period increase over the fiscal year ended september  was primarily attributable to increases in sales staff and insurance expense 
the fiscal year ended september  increase over the fiscal year ended october  was mainly due to increases in the sales staff  consulting fees  amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of universal chemicals  and employee benefit costs 
investment income investment income increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to  for the six month transitional period ended march  due to increased amounts of cash available for investment and the aforementioned change in our fiscal year end that resulted in the six month transitional period 
the increase was partially offset by a  loss recognized in the fiscal year ended march  due to declines in market value on investments which were deemed other than temporary 
investment income for the fiscal year ended march  was comparable to the fiscal year ended september   excluding the aforementioned  loss  as the increased amounts of cash available for investment during the fiscal year ended march  was offset by a lower rate of return 
interest income for the fiscal year ended september  decreased by  in comparison to the fiscal year ended october  due to less cash available for investment and a lower rate of return 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year ended march   for the six month transitional period ended march   for the fiscal year ended september  and for the fiscal year ended october  the increase for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the six month transitional period ended march  was primarily due to less tax exempt interest income 
the increase in the effective rate for the six month transitional period compared to the fiscal year ended september  was due to changes in state apportionment factors  and the decrease in the fiscal year ended september  from the fiscal year ended october  was due to changes in state apportionment factors and a deduction for dividends paid on allocated shares held in the employee stock ownership plan and trust 
inflation inflation did not have a significant impact on the company during the fiscal year ended march   the six month transitional period ended march   and the fiscal years ended september  and october   as selling prices have generally been adjusted as the cost of materials and other expenses have changed 
on occasion  slight fluctuations in the cost of a single  large volume product have not been reflected in the selling price of that product

the fixed income securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase

outlook expected future cash flows from operations  coupled with the company s strong financial position  puts the company in a position to fund both short and long term working capital and capital investment needs with internally generated funds 
management does not  therefore  anticipate the need to engage in significant financing activities in either the short or long term 
if the need to obtain additional capital does arise  however  management is confident that the company s total debt to capital ratio puts it in a position to obtain debt financing on favorable terms 
although management continually reviews opportunities to enhance the value of the company through strategic acquisitions  other capital investments and strategic divestitures  no material commitments for such investments or divestitures currently exist 
other than as discussed above  management is not aware of any matters or trends that have materially affected the results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  that are not expected to have either short or long term implications  nor is it aware of any trends or other matters that have not materially affected results in the fiscal year ended march  but are expected to have a material effect on future periods
