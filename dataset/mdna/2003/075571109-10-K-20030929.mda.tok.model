item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks that may affect results in this section 
our fiscal year ends on june of each calendar year 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
inventories 
our inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
we estimate shortage for the period between the last physical count and balance sheet date 
our estimate can be affected by shortage trends 
in order to assess that raw material is recorded properly we age the fabric inventory and record a reserve to reduce the cost in accordance with our established policy  which is based on historical experience 
to ensure that finished goods inventory is recorded properly  we review our inventory and reduce the cost if the selling price is marked down below cost 
these assumptions can have an impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as store closures  indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value we record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
in addition  at the time a decision is made to close a store  we record an impairment charge  if appropriate  or accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life 
for fiscal  we recorded a charge for the impairment of store assets of  we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
sales return reserve 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends 
for fiscal  the reserve was  compared to  in fiscal if actual returns are greater than those projected  additional sales returns may be recorded in the future 
income taxes 
we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of domestic and foreign tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years may be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and establishes standards for the recognition and measurement of asset impairment and disposal cost 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
the company adopted this statement on july  adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no 
sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may affect the timing of recognizing any future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
the company adopted this statement on december  adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended june  statements of operations data net sales cost of sales  including buying and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest and other expenses income  net earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  occupancy costs and buying costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs 
years ended june  and net sales 
net sales increased to million during the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  new  expanded or remodeled stores not included in the comparable store sales base added million to sales  while a decrease in comparable store sales of reduced sales by million 
the decrease in comparable store sales performance was attributed to the following marketplace conditions which impacted customer traffic to our stores  missed opportunities in key product categories and production delays which resulted in missed sales opportunities and increased promotional activities 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to for the year from during fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from negative occupancy leverage offset by slightly higher net merchandise margins 
negative occupancy expense leverage was the result of lower sales productivity 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs  increased to million during the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to during the year ended june  from in fiscal this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher compensation associated with the store commission structure  higher depreciation due to negative leverage and investments in the company s infrastructure  and store closure expenses and reserves which amounted to  related to store closures and an impairment reserve for stores 
expenses were also impacted by charges related to abandoned information technology projects which were offset by a favorable legal settlement 
interest and other expense income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income net of other expenses during the year ended june  as compared to million in fiscal average cash balances continued to increase arising from operating results offset by lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was as compared to in fiscal the lower effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to a lower effective state tax rate due to the benefits of the corporate legal entity restructuring 
years ended june  and net sales 
net sales increased to million during the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  new  expanded or remodeled stores not included in the comparable store sales base added million to sales  while a decrease in comparable store sales of reduced sales by million 
comparable store sales for the first half of fiscal decreased 
comparable store sales for the second half of fiscal decreased 
comparable store sales were positive from july  through september  following the september  terrorist attack  the decrease in comparable store sales was attributed to the following marketplace conditions  missed opportunities in key product categories  a product assortment heavily skewed toward the casual lifestyle  and the move of the production operation from brisbane  california to los angeles  california 
gross profit 
gross profit  which includes the cost of merchandise  buying and occupancy  increased to million for the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to for the year from during fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from negative occupancy expense leverage and reduced merchandise margins 
negative occupancy expense leverage was attributed to the lower sales productivity 
reduced merchandise margins were due to increased production costs related to the move of the production facility to los angeles  california  production delays and charges associated with the write off of fabric of approximately million 
merchandise margins were also reduced by a weaker product sell through  primarily in the first six months of the fiscal year  resulting in an increased level of markdowns and a change in the mix of sales between full price and outlet stores 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs  increased to million during the year ended june  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to during the year ended june  from in fiscal this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower compensation resulting from a change in our incentive plan  and a favorable settlement on a lawsuit 
in fiscal  we recorded  of expenses related to the tentative resolution of a lawsuit 
the decrease in expenses was offset by negative leverage associated with the decrease in comparable store sales and million of charges related to abandoned information technology projects 
interest and other expense income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income net of other expenses during the year ended june  as compared to million in fiscal average cash balances continued to increase  however lower interest rates during fiscal resulted in a reduction in interest income 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was as compared to in fiscal the lower effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to the benefits of converting united kingdom operations into a disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes 
seasonality of business and quarterly results our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail and apparel industries 
as a result  our typical store generates a disproportionate amount of our annual net sales and profitability in the second quarter of our fiscal year which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons compared to other quarters of our fiscal year 
if for any reason our sales were below seasonal norms during the second quarter of our fiscal year  our annual operating results would be negatively impacted 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements vary widely throughout the year and generally peak in the first and second fiscal quarters 
at june   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities short term and long term on hand 
in addition  we had a revolving line of credit  under which we could borrow or issue letters of credit up to a combined total of million 
as of june   there were no borrowings under the line of credit and letters of credit outstanding totaled million 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to was primarily the result of a decrease in net income  increase in inventories  and other changes in working capital 
net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the primary use of these funds was for capital expenditures and for  to purchase marketable securities of million 
capital expenditures in relate to the opening of new stores  investments in management information systems and the expansion of our corporate offices 
we opened new stores in fiscal  new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal we expect to open approximately to stores in fiscal during fiscal  new store construction costs before tenant allowances averaged  the average gross inventory investment was net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and was derived from proceeds from the issuance of common stock arising from stock option exercises 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with our cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements through fiscal we expect to renew our line of credit which expires in the second quarter of fiscal year to one with similar terms 
our future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including without limitation  the size and number of new and expanded stores  investment costs for management information systems  potential acquisitions and or joint ventures  repurchase of stock and future results of operations 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations as of june  total thereafter dollars in thousands contractual obligations operating leases amount of commitment expiration period total less than year years years after years dollars in thousands other commercial commitments revolving line of credit  net of outstanding letters of credit standby letters of credit trade letters of credit   total commercial commitments   as of june   there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the recent past 
however  we cannot assure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
risks that may affect results factors that might cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements discussed elsewhere in this report  as well as affect our ability to achieve our financial and other goals  include  but are not limited to  the following risks relating to our business the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to identify fashion trends as well as to react to changing customer demand in a timely manner 
consequently  we depend in part upon the continuing favorable market response to the creative efforts of our purchasing  design and marketing teams ability to anticipate trends and fashions that will appeal to our consumer base 
if we miscalculate our customers product preferences or the demand for our products  we may be faced with significant excess inventory or lack of inventory 
historically  this type of occurrence has resulted in excess fabric for some products  missed sales opportunities and markdowns and or write offs  which has impaired our profitability  and may do so in the future 
similarly  any failure on our part to anticipate  identify and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends will adversely affect our sales 
if we are unable to obtain raw materials or find manufacturing facilities  our financial condition may be harmed 
we do not own any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture our products 
we place all of our orders for production of merchandise and raw materials by purchase order and do not have any long term contracts with any manufacturer or supplier 
if we fail to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials  it could have a harmful effect on our results of operations 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards 
in such event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
if we fail to maintain favorable relationships with these production facilities and to obtain an adequate supply of quality raw materials on commercially reasonable terms  it could harm our business and results of operations 
we depend on third party apparel manufacturers for production and storage  and our sales may be negatively affected if the manufacturers do not perform acceptably  or if design changes are communicated after the production has begun 
we develop a significant portion of our merchandise in conjunction with third party apparel manufacturers 
in some cases  we select merchandise directly from these manufacturers lines 
we do not have long term contracts with any third party apparel manufacturers and purchase all of the merchandise from such manufacturers by purchase order 
furthermore  we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  shipments of products from third party apparel manufacturers that fail to conform to our quality control standards 
in such event  unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  we may lose sales 
we cannot assure you that third party manufacturers will not supply similar products to our competitors  will not stop supplying products to us completely or will supply products that satisfy our quality control standards 
in addition  certain of our third party manufacturers store our raw materials 
in the event our inventory was damaged or destroyed and we were unable to obtain replacement raw materials  our earnings may be negatively impacted 
in addition  if we decide to change a key element of the design after the manufacturing process has begun we may negatively impact the manufacturer s ability to deliver the products on a timely basis which could impact earnings 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees in order to support our existing business and future expansion 
we are actively recruiting qualified candidates to fill key executive positions ceo and cmo within the company 
there is substantial competition for experienced personnel  which we expect to continue 
we compete for experienced personnel with companies who have greater financial resources than we do 
in the past  we have experienced significant turnover of our executive management team and retail store personnel 
we are also exposed to employment practice litigation due to the large number of employees and high turnover of our sales associates 
if we fail to attract  motivate and retain qualified personnel  it could harm our business and limit our ability to expand 
in addition  we depend upon the expertise and execution of our key employees  particularly manny mashouf  the founder  chairman of the board  chief executive officer and majority shareholder 
we do not carry key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
if we lose the services of mr 
mashouf or any key officers or employees  it could harm our business and results of operations 
if we are not able to successfully develop and expand our new bebe sport store concept our revenue base and earnings may be impaired 
during fiscal  we launched a new store concept  bebe sport  in which our product offering is focused on active inspired sportswear branded with bebe sport 
we have committed significant financial and human resources to developing and expanding this concept 
the failure of this new store concept might result in a negative impact to earnings 
there can be no assurance that future store openings will be successful 
we expect to open approximately to stores in fiscal  of which approximately to will be bebe sport stores 
there can be no assurance that these stores  or any other stores that we might open in the future  will be successful or that our overall gross profit will increase as a result of opening these stores 
in addition  most of our new store openings in fiscal will be in existing markets 
these openings may affect the existing stores net sales volumes and profitability 
our failure to predict accurately the demographic or retail environment at any future store location could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any serious disruption at our major facilities could have a harmful effect on our business 
we currently operate our corporate office in brisbane  california  a distribution facility in benicia  california  and a design studio and production facility in los angeles  california 
any serious disruption at these facilities whether due to construction  relocation  fire  earthquake  terrorist acts or otherwise would harm our operations and could have a harmful effect on our business and results of operations 
furthermore  we have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate offices and are uncertain what effect operating such satellite facilities might have on business  personnel and results of operations 
we face significant competition in the retail and apparel industry  which could harm our sales and profitability 
the retail and apparel industries are highly competitive and are characterized by low barriers to entry 
key competitors include  but are not limited to arden b  bcbg  express  guess  forever  and the savvy department within nordstrom 
we expect competition in our markets to increase 
the primary competitive factors in our markets are brand name recognition  sourcing strategies  product styling  quality  presentation and pricing  timeliness of product development and delivery  store ambiance  customer service and convenience 
we compete with traditional department stores  specialty store retailers  business to consumer websites  off price retailers and direct marketers for  among other things  raw materials  market share  retail space  finished goods  sourcing and personnel 
because many of these competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial  distribution and marketing resources than we do  we may lack the resources to adequately compete with them 
if we fail to compete in any way  it could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
purchases of the merchandise we sell are generally discretionary and are therefore particularly susceptible to economic slowdowns 
if current economic conditions do not improve  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases  including purchases of fashion products  during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail 
currently  there is a general slowdown in the united states economy  which has adversely affected consumer confidence and spending habits  as well as our sales 
the outlook for the united states economy is uncertain and is directly affected by global political factors that are beyond our control 
any escalation of military action involving the united states could cause increased volatility in financial markets  further adversely affecting consumer confidence and spending habits 
if current economic conditions do not improve  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if we are not able to successfully protect our intellectual property our ability to capitalize on the value of our brand name may be impaired 
even though we take actions to establish  register and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights  we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that others will not imitate our products or infringe upon our intellectual property rights 
in addition  we cannot assure you that others will not resist or seek to block the sale of our products as infringements of their trademark and proprietary rights 
we are seeking to register our trademarks in targeted international markets 
in some of these markets  obstacles exist that may prevent us from obtaining a trademark for the bebe name or related names 
in such countries  we may not be able to register trademarks in these international markets  purchase the right or obtain a license to use the bebe name on commercially reasonable terms 
if we fail to obtain trademark  ownership or license rights  it would limit our ability to expand into certain international markets 
furthermore  in some jurisdictions  despite successful registration of our trademarks  third parties may allege infringement and bring actions against us 
in addition  if our licensees fail to use our intellectual property correctly  the goodwill associated with our trademarks may be diluted 
both domestically and internationally  if we do not show use of our trademarks  our trademark rights may lapse over time 
if an independent manufacturer violates labor or other laws  or is accused of violating any such laws  or if their labor practices diverge from those generally accepted as ethical  it could harm our business and brand image 
while we maintain a policy to monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers by having an independent firm inspect these manufacturing sites  and all manufacturers are contractually required to comply with such labor practices  we cannot control the actions or the public s perceptions of such manufacturers  nor can we assure that these manufacturers will conduct their businesses using ethical or legal labor practices 
apparel companies can be held jointly liable for the wrongdoings of the manufacturers of their products 
while we do not control their employees employment conditions or the manufacturer s business practices  and the manufacturers act in their own interest  they may act in a manner that result in negative public perceptions of us and or employee allegations or court determinations that we are jointly liable 
currently  there are two litigation matters pending that involve labor disputes 
although the amount of liability with respect to these actions cannot be accurately predicted  in the opinion of management  any such liability will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks relating to our common stock our stock price may fluctuate because of the small number of shares that can be publicly traded and the low average daily trading volumes 
the vast majority of our outstanding shares of our common stock are not registered and are subject to trading restrictions 
as of june   only  shares of our common stock were available to be publicly traded  and as a result  our average daily trading volumes are relatively low  and our stock price is vulnerable to market swings due to large purchases  sales and short sales of our common stock 
because a principal shareholder controls the company  other shareholders may not be able to influence the direction the company takes 
as of june   manny mashouf  the chairman of the board and chief executive officer  beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  he alone can control the election of directors and the outcome of all issues submitted to the shareholders 
this may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire shares  may discourage acquisition bids  and could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of common stock 
this concentration of stock ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
we currently maintain a portfolio of fixed and variable investments consisting of cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities  which can be affected by changes in market interest rates 
according to our investment policy  we may invest in taxable and tax exempt instruments 
in addition  the policy establishes limits on credit quality  maturity  issuer and type of instrument 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale 
marketable securities are comprised of tax exempt municipal bonds 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
the remaining investments are considered short term marketable securities if maturities range between four and twelve months or long term marketable securities if maturities are over twelve months 
the following table lists our cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities at june  fair value dollars in thousands cash equivalents   weighted average interest rate short term marketable securities   weighted average interest rate long term marketable securities   weighted average interest rate total   the interest payable on our bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates rose 
basis points a change from the bank s reference rate as of june   our results from operations and cash flows would not be significantly affected 
foreign currency risks 
we enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the us which are settled in us dollars and  therefore  we have only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we also operate a subsidiary with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
this subsidiary represented less than two percent of total revenues for fiscal year and  therefore  presents only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
