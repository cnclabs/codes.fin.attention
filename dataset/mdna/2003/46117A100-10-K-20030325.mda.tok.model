item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading provider of solutions that manage and deliver mission critical information for telecommunications providers and public safety organizations 
our customers include ixcs  ilecs  clecs  wireless carriers and state and local governments in the united states 
we manage the data that enables a call to be routed to the appropriate public safety agency with accurate and timely information about the caller s identification  callback number and location 
we also provide supporting hardware and software technology to psaps via the palladium call center and data management systems 
these systems are used by public safety call centers across the united states to receive and respond to wireline and wireless e calls 
we generate revenue from five segments  or business units ilec  clec  wireless  direct and corporate 
our revenue is derived from monthly data management services  ongoing maintenance  sales of new products and systems  and professional services 
the revenue derived from monthly data management services and ongoing maintenance of existing systems accounts for the majority of our revenue 
we consider this recurring revenue as it is derived from long term contracts with terms of up to years 
in  recurring revenue accounted for million  or  of our million in total revenue 
in  recurring revenue represented million  or  of our total revenue of million 
the following table represents total revenue amounts in thousands and percentages by business unit year ended december  revenue percentage ilec    clec    wireless    direct    corporate we expect our recurring revenue base to continue to increase in the future  based primarily on continued deployment of services to our wireless customers 
we also expect incremental contributions to our recurring revenue base from sales of intellicast sm services by our direct business unit 
factors that could adversely impact our recurring revenue base in the future include our ability to renew long term contracts with ilec and wireless customers and pricing pressures encountered in renewal negotiations 
we also expect our sales of new services  including intellibase sm nrlldb and intellicast sm  to provide incremental contributions to recurring revenue growth 
we generate non recurring revenue from the sale of software  enhancement services  systems and professional services  primarily within our ilec  wireless and direct business units 
our ability to sustain or continue to grow our revenues in these areas will be dependent upon a variety of factors  including our ability to develop and deliver enhancements that have viability to our customers  our sales efforts  and customer purchasing patterns 
if market acceptance and sales efforts are not successful  our investments in infrastructure and support costs may have to be written off and our revenue  net income and cash flow may be adversely affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
while preparing these financial statements  we made estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory  intangible assets  capitalized software costs  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  and sop no 
 software revenue recognition  our policy is to recognize revenue when the following revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered as evidenced by customer acceptance  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenue is derived from long term contracts with our customers and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract as services are performed 
we also sell software enhancements and professional services to our customer base which may not be subject to deferral under sab for the three months and twelve months ended december   we recognized million and million  respectively  in revenue from the sale of software enhancements and licenses  and professional services that had been deferred under sab in a previous period 
for the three months and twelve months ended december   we recognized million and million  respectively  in revenue from the sale of software enhancements and licenses  and professional services  under sab  these revenues were not deferred to future periods 
allowances we maintain allowances and reserves for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and for credit memos which may be granted to customers in future periods that relate to revenue recognized in current periods 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or concessions or discounts are granted in future periods which exceed our estimates  additional allowances and reserves may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was  up from  at december  and the reserve for credit memos was  up from  at december  the increases are primarily attributable to bankruptcy filings during by some of our clec customers  most notably worldcom 
deterioration in the financial condition of or further bankruptcies by our current customers may cause our allowance for doubtful accounts to increase and our future operating results to be adversely affected 
through normal course  we are involved in minor billing disputes with certain customers that are of an insignificant nature 
the resolution of these minor disputes may result in the granting of credit memos to the customer 
we believe that we are adequately reserved for potential bad debts and future credit memos at december  software capitalization we capitalize certain software development costs related to significant new product offerings after technological feasibility is established and prior to general release or availability 
we develop software for internal use  which is accounted for under sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
we also develop software that is sold or otherwise marketed to customers  which is accounted for under fas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
capitalization of software under sop requires judgment in determining when and if a project is in the application development stage  when the software is available for general release and its intended use  the expected benefits to be derived from the software product  the useful life of the software product and  the future recoverability of the capitalized amounts 
capitalization of software under fas requires judgment in determining when and if a project has reached the technological feasibility phase  when the software is available for general release  the expected benefits to be derived from the software product  the useful life of the software product  and the future recoverability of the capitalized amounts 
we capitalized million in additional development costs during the year ended december  based on our estimates and determinations that the above criteria had been met 
the costs related primarily to ongoing efforts to develop new services  such as intellibase sm nrlldb  the mpc and a major software enhancement project for one of our ilec customers 
in october  several larger software products  including nrlldb and mpc  reached general availability and were ready for their intended use and began to be amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of three years 
the estimated amortization expense of these and other products previously completed will have a significant impact on operating expenses and profitability going forward 
we estimate that the annual amortization expense for existing software assets will be approximately million for each of the next three years 
further  our business cases that support the net realizable value nrv of these software products could change significantly  therefore resulting in a need to write off or impair our current carrying values on the balance sheet 
as a result of our quarterly review of the nrv of all software  we deemed a software product impaired and realized a write down of  in december as the supporting business case for the product had declined materially since the original capitalization date 
deferred tax assets during the quarter ended december   management determined that it was more likely than not that deferred tax assets of approximately million  consisting mainly of available net operating loss nol carryforwards  would be utilized to offset expected taxable income in the future 
in making this determination  management weighed two primary factors our historical profitability over the last five quarters dating back to december   and the likelihood that we would continue to generate taxable income in the future 
based on these primary factors  we determined that the previous valuation allowance was no longer necessary 
as a result  the previously established valuation allowance was reversed and recorded as an income tax benefit of  and an increase to additional paid in capital of  during the quarter ended december  the historical treatment of our deferred tax assets and the valuation allowance recorded is discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there can be no absolute assurance that we will generate in the future the expected taxable income used in making this determination or that all of our nol carryforwards will be utilized in the manner we expect 
as additional evidence becomes available  we will continue to re evaluate estimates and judgments related to the recoverability of deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance as required by fas  accounting for income taxes 
if expected taxable income is not generated in future years  it may be necessary to reverse some or all or the tax benefit recorded  adversely impacting tax expense and net income going forward 
goodwill and long lived assets and their impairment we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets including property and equipment and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
in addition  we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets including property and equipment and goodwill may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on estimated discounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition and compare the result to the asset s carrying amount 
any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
there were no impairment losses in or in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and  as a result  we no longer amortize approximately million in net goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill 
we completed our initial and annual impairment reviews for  which supported the current carrying value for goodwill 
contingencies in conjunction with our may acquisition of lucent public safety systems  we agreed to issue up to million of mandatorily redeemable  non voting  preferred stock  subject to our attainment of specific total revenue targets during a month contingency period that began on june  and will end on may  the right to receive intrado preferred stock is currently held by nv partners ii lp  formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of lucent technologies inc if our total revenue  as defined in the purchase agreement between lucent technologies inc and intrado  meets or exceeds a maximum threshold of million for that month period  then we will be required to issue million of preferred stock to nv partners ii lp 
if our total revenue during the month contingency period is greater than the minimum threshold of million  but less than the maximum threshold of million  we will be required to issue preferred stock to nv partners ii lp at a rate of  for each million dollars of total revenue in excess of million 
if our total revenue is less than or equal to the minimum threshold of million during the month contingency period  then we will not be required to issue any preferred stock 
over the month period beginning on june  and ending on december   we recorded approximately million in total revenue 
we estimate that the value of the preferred stock issued to nv partners ii lp will range between million and million 
the preferred stock would be redeemable in three equal annual installments  beginning in july the commitment to issue preferred stock will not be recorded until the total revenue targets are met  if at all  and would be treated as an increase in the purchase price by increasing goodwill
