while many of our competitors experienced revenue declines  we were able to maintain our revenue levels 
our revenue performance was driven by success in selling integrated storage solutions  as well as a growing revenue contribution from new service offerings 
we were able to maintain our storage products gross profit margin and improve our storage services gross profit margin by focusing on reducing costs and expenses 
our focus on costs and expenses also drove improvements in net income 
to reduce costs and expenses  we focused on improving the productivity of our global supply chain  applying more efficient inventory management processes  and prioritizing our research and development activities 
we reviewed all areas of the business to determine the best use of our resources in meeting customer service objectives and improving time to market  cost  and manufacturing efficiency 
these reviews resulted in changes such as outsourcing our printed circuit board manufacturing operations and reducing inventory 
we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and cash flows during our cash and cash equivalents increased to million as of december  a million improvement compared to the december level 
inventory levels decreased by million from to  and debt to total capitalization decreased from in to in our cash flow from operations increased to million in  a million increase compared to through our strong balance sheet and cash flows  we are positioning ourselves to seize future opportunities that will strengthen our business and improve our competitive advantage 
revenue and gross profit margin total revenue for was billion  largely unchanged compared to storage products revenue decreased  but was largely offset by increased storage services revenue 
total gross profit margin of increased points from the increase in gross profit margin was due to improvements in storage services margin  slightly offset by decreases in storage products gross profit margin 
total revenue for was billion  largely unchanged compared to storage products revenue decreased  but was largely offset by increased storage services revenue 
total gross profit margin of increased points from the increase in gross profit margin was due to improvements in both storage products gross profit margin and storage services gross profit margin 
storage products our storage products revenue consists of sales of tape products  disk products  and network products  including related software  for the mainframe and open systems markets 
the open systems market consists of products designed to operate in the unix  nt  and other non mvs operating environments 
storage products revenue decreased in  compared to  primarily due to a decrease in tape product sales 
we believe the decline in tape product sales is primarily attributable to the current global economic conditions and the associated weakness in information technology spending  which translated into lower unit sales in the decline in tape products was partially offset by increased sales of disk and network products 
we believe this revenue growth was driven by early successes in our efforts to provide integrated solutions of tape  disk  and network products  together with associated services 
storage products gross profit margin decreased slightly in this decline reflects an increasing revenue contribution from our indirect channels  which typically carry lower gross profit margins 
the margin pressure was largely offset by our efforts to reduce product costs 
we anticipate both of these trends will continue to largely offset each other in  however  we expect margins to be lower early in the year due to lower anticipated production volumes and the related impact on fixed cost absorption 
storage products revenue decreased in  compared to  primarily due to significant price erosion and competition in the disk market 
storage products gross profit margin increased points in versus  primarily due to more favorable channel and product mixes 
a higher percentage of our product revenue was generated by the direct sales channel in  which typically results in higher margins  and product mix shifted toward our higher margin products 
the gross profit margin increases were partially offset by decreases in the selling prices for disk products 
storage services our storage services revenue consists primarily of revenue associated with the maintenance and support of our storage products and third party storage products  as well as professional services revenue associated with diverse storage consulting activities 
storage services revenue increased in  compared to the growth in service revenue was driven largely by an expanded effort to sell services that help customers successfully manage their storage requirements  with balanced growth across our storage services portfolio 
new service offerings include various storage consulting services  implementation services  and storage management services 
storage services gross profit margin increased points in versus  reflecting improvements in spare parts utilization and the service delivery process 
we expect that further improvements in service margin will be tempered by the increased revenue contribution from the new service offerings  which typically carry lower margins than our maintenance and support services 
storage services revenue increased in  compared to storage services gross profit margin increased points in versus we attribute these increases primarily to improvements in the service delivery process and certain incremental billings 
research and product development research and product development expenses decreased in  compared to  and decreased in  compared to we evaluate and prioritize research and product development programs to maximize our return on investment 
our research and product development activities focus on the core businesses of tape products  virtual storage  and san products and related services 
research and product development costs as a percentage of total revenue were in  compared to in and in we conduct research and product development activities primarily internally  but we also enter into strategic partnerships and outsourcing arrangements for certain research and product development activities 
no single research or product development project is expected to be individually material to our financial condition or results of operations  either in terms of the estimated future cost to complete or in terms of expected future revenue or cash flows resulting from the completion of the project 
selling  general  and administrative expense selling  general  and administrative expense sg a remained largely unchanged in  compared to sg a decreased in  compared to  primarily as a result of restructuring activities in sg a as a percentage of total revenue was approximately in  in  and in sg a includes some items in each year that we believe are not indicative of future trends because of the circumstances that gave rise to the recognition of these items 
the following table and accompanying description explains the nature of each of these items in thousands fiscal year ended december litigation settlement recovery  investment writedowns   restructuring activities  other  total impact on sg a    in september  we recognized a charge of million in connection with the writedown of a cost method investment 
this impairment charge resulted from the announcement of a purchase of the investee for less than our cost basis 
as a result of this development  we concluded that the decrease in the value of our investment was other than temporary in nature 
in december  we recognized a gain of million in connection with the settlement of a claim against a third party that arose from a lawsuit settlement 
in december  we recognized a charge of million in connection with the writedown of a cost method investment 
this impairment charge resulted from adverse developments in the financial condition of the investee during the fourth quarter of that resulted in a recapitalization of the company 
as a result of these adverse developments  we concluded that the decrease in the value of our investment was other than temporary in nature 
we have no remaining net book value for this investment as a result of the impairment charge 
in december  we recognized a charge of million related to the abandonment of a building  investment losses associated with a retirement plan for employees of an international subsidiary  and non recurring severance charges incurred in connection with a headcount reduction 
substantially all of the severance charges were incurred and paid during the fourth quarter of during  we incurred approximately million of restructuring expense in connection with a broad restructuring program announced in october approximately million of this charge related to employee severance expense  million related to the impairment writedown of assets at our manufacturing facility in toulouse  france  as well as asset writedowns associated with the spin off of our managed storage services business  and  related to excess lease space in canada and legal and accounting expenses associated with the spin off of our managed storage services business 
the restructuring program was completed in the third quarter of interest income and expense interest income was largely unchanged in compared to interest expense decreased million in  compared to  primarily due to a decrease in outstanding debt 
interest income increased  in  compared to  as a result of an increase in cash available for investment 
interest expense decreased million in  compared to  due to decreased borrowings under our debt and financing arrangements 
see liquidity and capital resources external sources of liquidity for further discussion of our debt and financing arrangements 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in  in  and in the reduction in effective tax rate for was due to two factors 
a million tax benefit from the favorable resolution of prior year tax audits in the fourth quarter of accounted for approximately percentage points of the total decrease 
the realization of benefits associated primarily with our manufacturing operations in puerto rico accounted for the other percentage points of the total decrease 
we expect that our effective tax rate in will be higher than the effective tax rate for statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred income tax assets be recognized to the extent that realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based on the currently available information  we have determined that we will more likely than not realize approximately million of deferred income tax assets as of december  our valuation allowance of approximately million as of december   relates principally to foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related revenue and expenses  and disclosure of gain or loss contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
certain accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  and under different assumptions or conditions  those estimates could be materially different 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that the application of the following critical accounting policies affects our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the majority of our products and services are delivered subject to agreements with standard terms and conditions 
in certain situations  however  our agreements may include non standard terms and conditions  or the transactions may contain multiple elements 
in these situations  we must make judgments to determine the appropriate accounting 
these judgments generally involve assessments regarding matters such as whether there are sufficient legally binding terms and conditions  whether customer acceptance has been received  how the price should be allocated among the delivered and undelivered elements  and whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 
we evaluate the sufficiency of the terms and conditions of our agreements  as well as whether customer acceptance has been received  based on advice from legal counsel 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements in a multiple element arrangement once all of the following criteria are satisfied a uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved  b no significant obligations for performance remain  c the undelivered elements are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  and d the fair value of each undelivered element is clearly determinable 
any elements for which we do not recognize revenue are deferred and recorded as an accrued liability 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor programs  including price protection  rebates  and other volume based incentives 
for those sales recognized under the sell in method of accounting  we record estimated reductions in revenue for anticipated future returns 
these reserves are determined based on our historical claims and returns experience 
our actual claims experience in future periods may differ from our historical experience 
our standard product warranties provide for the repair or replacement of products that fail to meet their published specifications 
in situations where a product fails its essential purpose to the customer  we may also be responsible for refunding the purchase price of the product to our customer if we cannot remedy the product failure 
we establish a warranty liability for the estimated cost of warranty related claims at the time revenue is recognized 
the amount of the warranty liability reflects our estimate of the expected future costs of fulfilling our obligations under the warranties 
in developing our estimate  we consider our historical experience  the length of the warranty period  and the expectations for new products 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  the development of new products involves the integration of complex designs and processes both by us and by our suppliers 
if we discover a product design flaw or other unanticipated problem  our actual warranty costs may differ significantly from our original estimates 
if we determine that an increased warranty amount is necessary  we would increase the warranty liability and cost of revenue in the period the determination was made 
the following table summarizes information related to our warranty reserves in thousands fiscal year ended december balance at beginning of year    accruals for warranties issued during the year   adjustments to warranties   amortization during the year    balance at end of year    we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on both a specific analysis of known situations where we anticipate that customers will be unable to meet their financial obligations and a general analysis of the length of time the receivables are past due 
we perform a quarterly analysis of our historical bad debt write off experience to assess the reserve requirements for our aged receivables 
if circumstances related to a specific customer change  or if our historical bad debt write off experience changes as a result of changes in global economic conditions or other changes in our business  we may need to subsequently adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the following table summarizes information related to our allowance for doubtful accounts in thousands fiscal year ended december balance at beginning of year    bad debt expense    write offs  net of recoveries    balance at end of year    inventory reserves we had inventory reserves of million as of december   for obsolete  slow moving  and non saleable inventory 
we establish and evaluate our inventory reserve estimates based on a quarterly review of inventory cost versus estimated market value 
market value estimates involve significant judgments about a number of factors  including the impacts of future product or technology introductions by us or by our competitors  delays in the availability of new products  changes in the purchasing patterns of our customers  and changes in global economic conditions 
to the extent that inventory cost exceeds estimated market value  we would increase our inventory reserve  which would result in a corresponding charge to cost of revenue 
the following table summarizes information related to our inventory reserves in thousands fiscal year ended december balance at beginning of year    additions charged to cost of revenue    inventory write offs    balance at end of year    accounting for income taxes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions  both within and outside the united states 
in order to determine our tax provision  we allocate income to each of these jurisdictions based on applicable tax laws 
because tax laws vary by jurisdiction and are subject to interpretation  we must make various judgments and estimates in determining the allocations 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income  and other complex tax issues  may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to our allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates 
while we believe that we have appropriately provided for income taxes for all years  the resolution of tax audits may result in significant adjustments to our tax provision and the associated financial results 
our current effective tax rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the united states and in the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located 
future changes in us or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefit we are currently receiving 
in addition  a change in the mix of our income among tax jurisdictions could change our overall effective tax rate 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe will more likely than not be realized 
we assess the need for a valuation allowance by reviewing our earnings history  the number of years that our operating losses and tax credits can be carried forward  and future taxable income expectations by tax jurisdiction 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to adjust the valuation allowance 
if  in our assessment  we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the recorded amount  we would decrease the valuation allowance  which would cause tax expense to decrease 
likewise  if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  we would increase the valuation allowance  which would cause tax expense to increase

liquidity and capital resources internal sources of liquidity we had million of cash at the end of  compared to million at the end of the million increase during was a result of cash flows generated by our operations 
our operating activities provided cash of million during  compared to million during the increase in cash provided by operations during was primarily due to our efforts to effectively manage working capital 
cash used in investing activities increased to million during  compared to million during  primarily due to the repurchase of million of tape storage equipment from eds in connection with a storage services agreement 
cash used in financing activities increased to million during  as compared to million during the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repayment of borrowings under our credit facilities in our cash balance increased million in as a result of cash flows generated by our operations 
our operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily related to receipt of tax refunds of million in cash used in investing activities decreased to million during  as compared to million in  primarily due to decreased expenditures on property  plant  and equipment 
cash used in financing activities decreased million in  primarily due to repayments of borrowings under our credit facilities in we expect that cash flows from operations will continue to serve as our principal source of liquidity 
cash flows from operations could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products and services as a result of rapid technological changes and other risks described under factors that may affect future results 
external sources of liquidity we have a million revolving credit facility the revolver that expires in october the interest rates for borrowing under the revolver are dependent on our total debt to rolling four quarter earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda ratio and the term of the outstanding borrowing 
the rate ranges from the applicable libor plus to or the agent bank s base rate plus to 
we pay a per annum commitment fee on any unused borrowings 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolver as of december  the revolver is secured by our us accounts receivable and us inventory  and contains certain financial and other covenants  including restrictions on the payment of cash dividends on our common stock 
we had a financing agreement with a bank that provided for the sale of promissory notes in the principal amount of up to million at any one time 
this agreement expired in january  and all of the outstanding promissory notes under the agreement were repaid at that time 
our debt to capitalization ratio decreased from as of december   to as of december   primarily due to the repayment of borrowings under our credit facilities 
contractual obligations following is a summary of all of our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations      operating lease obligations     purchase obligations      total      purchase obligations include a significant outsourcing arrangement with eds  which is more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect to fund all of our obligations through cash flows from operations 
we believe that we have adequate working capital and financing capabilities to meet our anticipated operating and capital requirements for the next months 
over the longer term  we may choose to fund these activities through the issuance of additional equity or debt financing 
the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot provide any assurance that such additional long term financing  if required  could be completed on favorable terms 
international operations international operations accounted for approximately of our revenue in  compared to in and we also sell products through us indirect channel partners that have some of their end user customers located outside the united states 
we expect that we will continue to generate a significant portion of our revenue from international operations 
see we may be materially affected by the risks of conducting business outside the united states under factors that may affect future results for a discussion of the risks associated with conducting business outside the united states 
the majority of our international operations involve transactions denominated in the local currencies of countries within western europe  principally france  germany  and the united kingdom  australia  canada  japan  and south korea 
an increase in the exchange value of the us dollar reduces the value of revenue and profits generated by our international operations 
as a result  our operating and financial results can be materially affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in an attempt to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  we employ a foreign currency hedging program 
see market risk management below 
market risk management foreign currency exchange rate risk our primary market risk relates to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the functional currency for our foreign subsidiaries is the us dollar 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated by our international operations 
as a result  our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows can be materially affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we attempt to mitigate this exposure as part of our foreign currency hedging program 
the primary goal of our foreign currency hedging program is to reduce the risk of adverse foreign currency movements on the reported financial results of our non us dollar transactions 
factors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets 
all foreign currency derivatives are authorized and executed pursuant to our policies 
we do not hold or issue derivatives or any other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
to implement our foreign currency hedging program  we use foreign currency options and forwards 
these derivatives are used to hedge the risk that forecasted revenue denominated in foreign currencies might be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign currency forwards are also used to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates applied to our foreign currency exchange rate sensitive instruments held as of december   and as of december   would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million and million  respectively 
the determination of the fair value of these instruments is described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k 
the increase in the hypothetical loss for is primarily due to an increase in outstanding derivatives used to hedge forecasted cash flows associated with forecasted revenue 
these hypothetical losses do not take our underlying international operations into consideration 
we anticipate that any hypothetical loss associated with our foreign currency exchange rate sensitive instruments would be offset by gains associated with our underlying international operations 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates affect interest income earned on our cash investments  as well as interest expense on short term borrowings 
a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates applied to cash investments and short term borrowings would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash investments  foreign currency derivatives  and trade receivables 
we do not believe that our cash investments and foreign currency derivatives present significant credit risks  because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions  and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty 
substantially all trade receivable balances are unsecured 
the concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited by the large number of customers in our customer base and their dispersion across various industries and geographic areas 
although we have a large number of customers who are dispersed across different industries and geographic areas  a prolonged economic downturn could increase our exposure to credit risk on our trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses 
factors that may affect future results we may be materially affected by global economic and political conditions our ability to generate revenue growth during and was adversely affected by the slowdown in the global economy as customers delayed their purchase decisions  reduced their information technology spending budgets  increased their purchase authorization approval requirements  and reduced their capital expenditures by maximizing the current capacities of their data storage equipment 
we do not currently anticipate any significant improvement in information technology spending during during  we implemented various cost saving measures to help mitigate the adverse effects of the slowdown in the global economy 
we cannot provide any assurance that a prolonged economic downturn will not have additional adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations  or our ability to generate revenue growth 
furthermore  we cannot provide any assurance that our cost saving measures will be successful or sufficient to allow us to continue to generate improved operating results in future periods 
our financial condition and results of operations could also be materially affected by unstable global political conditions 
terrorist attacks or acts of war could significantly disrupt our operations and the operations of our customers  suppliers  distributors  or resellers 
we cannot predict the potential impact on our financial condition or results of operations should such events occur 
we may be materially affected by a decrease in demand for our tape products or by an inability to maintain key competitive advantages in tape in  approximately of our storage products revenue was generated by sales of our tape products 
tape products also generate a significant portion of our storage services revenue 
if overall demand for tape storage products declines  or if we lose market share in tape  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
one of the key competitive advantages that our tape products have over competing disk products is that tape products store data at a fraction of the cost of disk storage 
the cost of disk storage continues to decrease rapidly due to competition and new disk drive technologies such as advanced technology attachment ata 
we must continue to develop and introduce new tape products that reduce the cost of tape storage at a rate that is similar to or greater than the decline in disk storage costs in order to maintain this competitive advantage 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to reduce the cost of our tape products at a rate similar to the decline in disk storage costs 
we may be materially affected by aggressive competition the data storage industry is highly competitive  and customers make their decisions based on a number of competitive factors  including the following functionality technology performance reliability system scalability price quality product availability customer service brand recognition we must address each of these factors effectively in order to successfully compete 
if we are unable to adapt our products and services to changes in these competitive factors  we may lose market share to our competitors 
we achieved some initial success during in our efforts to address customer storage needs by focusing on the delivery of storage solutions that include a combination of tape  disk  and network products  together with the associated services 
this success resulted in increased revenue contributions from disk products  network products  and services during in order to grow revenue in the future  it is critical that we execute on our information lifecycle management strategy by continuing to capitalize on our ability to deliver complete storage solutions to solve customer storage requirements 
we may be materially affected by our ability to grow our indirect channels successfully we are continually developing our indirect distribution channels  including original equipment manufacturers oems  value added distributors vads  value added resellers vars  and other distributors 
indirect channels sales contributed approximately of our total product revenue in  compared to in and in increasing our sales through these indirect channels is critical to expanding our reach into the growing open systems market 
successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to effectively reach all the potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in expanding our indirect channel sales 
our ability to forecast future demand for our products may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in demand from our indirect channel partners 
maintenance revenue also may be adversely affected in future periods to the extent that customers of our indirect channel partners elect to purchase maintenance services from our competitors 
our financial results may also be negatively affected if the financial condition of one or more of our channel partners weakens or if the current economic downturn continues 
we may be materially affected by the risks associated with expanding our service offerings services contributed approximately of our total revenue in  compared to in and in this growth was driven by new service offerings such as storage consulting services  implementation services  and storage management services 
the development and delivery of these new services are critical to the success of our plan to deliver complete storage solutions to our customers 
we must ensure that service professionals have the necessary skill sets  experience  tools  and training to support these new service offerings 
any failure to properly develop or deliver our new and existing service offerings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be materially affected by the risks associated with sole source suppliers we purchase certain key parts  components  and services from sole source suppliers who we believe are currently the only providers that meet our specifications or for which alternative sources of supply are not readily available 
the following table shows our significant sole source suppliers and the products or services they provide name of sole source supplier product or service provided imation corporation t and t series tape media sanmina sci corporation printed circuit boards and certain other manufacturing and repair services lsi logic storage systems d series disk products fujitsu electronics america application specific integrated circuits asics for various tape and disk products philips semiconductors asics for various tape and disk products celestica sn network product herald datanetics ltd 
hdl key component used in certain tape products we also obtain certain key parts and components from less significant sole source suppliers 
if a sole source supplier did not continue to provide its products or services  we would need to identify and qualify other acceptable suppliers 
this process could take an extended period  and we cannot provide any assurance that we could identify and qualify an alternative source on a timely basis or at an acceptable quality or price 
we cannot provide any assurance that significant sole source suppliers will be able to meet our ongoing quality or delivery requirements 
failure to meet these requirements may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
hdl is located in the people s republic of china prc 
our dependence on hdl is subject to additional risks beyond those associated with other sole source suppliers  including the lack of a well established court system or acceptance of the rule of law in the prc  the degree to which the prc permits economic reform policies to continue  the political relationship between the prc and the united states  and broader political and economic factors 
to date  we have not experienced any material problems securing key components from hdl  however  we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience material problems in the future 
we may be materially affected by a failure to obtain quality parts and components in a timely manner or by a failure to effectively manage inventory levels we generally use standard parts and components for our products and believe that there are a number of alternative  competent vendors for most of those parts and components 
certain suppliers have experienced occasional technical  financial  or other problems that have delayed deliveries in the past 
an unanticipated failure of suppliers to meet our requirements for an extended period  or the inability to secure comparable components in a timely manner  could result in a shortage of key components or products  longer lead times  reduced control over production and delivery schedules  and an inability to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner 
we have reduced our inventory levels by over in  primarily as a result of lean manufacturing initiatives 
as we continue to move toward a lean manufacturing environment  we will become increasingly dependent on a limited supplier base to deliver quality parts and components in a timely manner 
a supplier s inability to deliver parts and components on a timely basis  or our failure to effectively manage inventory levels  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be materially affected by uneven sales patterns and by our ability to forecast customer demand accurately in the past  our results have followed a seasonal pattern  which reflects the tendency of customers to make their purchase decisions at the end of a calendar year 
during any fiscal quarter  a disproportionately large percentage of total product sales is earned in the last weeks or days of the quarter 
it is difficult to predict the extent to which these historical trends will continue in the future 
these uneven sales patterns have become more pronounced with the slowdown in the global economy 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to manage our uneven sales patterns 
we prepare and update our forecasts on a regular basis to predict customer demand for our products and services 
if predicted demand is higher than actual demand  we may have excess inventory or an underutilized employee base 
if actual demand exceeds predicted demand  we may not be able to meet customer requirements in a timely manner due to manufacturing or service constraints 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to forecast customer demand accurately or respond quickly to changes in customer demand 
our gross profit margin may be materially affected by product mix  channel mix  and resale of third party products we provide a variety of solutions to meet customer needs  including tape  disk  and network products along with associated services 
our products and services contribute varying gross profit margins  and the gross margin on a customer s total solution is dependent on the amounts and types of products or services involved 
we cannot provide any assurance that our future gross profit margin will be similar to our historical gross profit margin 
we market our solutions through a combination of a direct sales organization and indirect channel partners 
direct sales to the end user customer usually result in higher gross profit margins than indirect channel sales 
we cannot provide any assurance that changes in our channel mix will not have a material impact on gross profit margin in the future 
pressure on our disk product gross profit margins is expected to increase as our disk revenue shifts from our enterprise class products to open systems products developed and manufactured by lsi 
we continue to increase the amount of third party products sold  and our gross profit margin may be adversely affected by the use of these products in our total storage solutions 
we may also be at a cost disadvantage in acquiring third party products that are manufactured by competitors 
we may be materially affected by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards short product life cycles are inherent in high technology industries due to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards 
our financial condition and results of operations depend on our ability to respond effectively to these changes 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully develop  manufacture  and market innovative new products or adapt our current products to new technologies or new industry standards 
in addition  customers may be reluctant to adopt new technologies and standards  or they may prefer competing technologies and standards 
san solutions are an example of the rapid technological change in our industry  since san technologies and standards are continually evolving 
we continue to develop the necessary product modifications and professional services knowledge to implement our san solutions successfully in various customer operating environments 
because the san market changes so quickly  it is difficult to predict the future rate of adoption of our san solutions 
we may be materially affected by risks associated with new product development new product research and development is complex and requires the investigation and evaluation of multiple alternatives  as well as planning the design and manufacture of those alternatives selected for further development 
research and development efforts could be adversely affected by any of the following hardware and software design flaws product development delays changes in data storage technology changes in operating systems changes in industry standards in addition  we have outsourced software development for certain tape and network products to wipro technologies 
we cannot provide any assurance that research and development activities will be successful in bringing new products to market 
manufacturing new products involves integrating complex designs and processes  coordinating with suppliers for parts and components  and managing manufacturing capacities to accommodate forecasted demand 
failure to obtain sufficient quantities of parts and components  as well as other manufacturing delays or constraints  could adversely affect the timing of new product introductions 
we have experienced product development and manufacturing delays in the past that adversely affected our results of operations and competitive position 
when we introduce new products  we must effectively manage the transition from our existing products to the new products 
if we do not manage the transition effectively  we may be subject to the following adverse effects excess or obsolete inventory insufficient inventory or manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand delayed customer purchases lost sales if customers purchase from our competitors in addition  sales of our new products may replace some of the sales of our existing products 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the development  introduction  or transition of new products in the future 
we may be materially affected by the risks associated with developing and protecting intellectual property we depend on our ability to develop new intellectual property that does not infringe on the rights of others 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to develop such new intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of us patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property rights 
we enter into confidentiality agreements relating to our intellectual property with our employees and consultants  and we include confidentiality provisions in license and non exclusive sales agreements with our customers 
we also file patent and trademark registration applications with foreign governments  however  many foreign countries do not have intellectual property laws that are as well developed as those of the united states 
despite all of our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property 
monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  particularly in foreign countries 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our intellectual property 
we may be materially affected if we are unable to attract  retain  and motivate key employees our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract  retain  and motivate our key employees 
we face significant competition for individuals who possess the skills required to sell our products and services  as well as design  develop  manufacture  and market those products and services 
an inability to successfully attract  retain  and motivate these employees could have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations 
we may be materially affected by the risks of conducting business outside the united states our international business may be affected by changes in demand resulting from global and localized economic  business  and political conditions 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states  including the following risks adverse political and economic conditions impositions of tariffs or quotas changes in laws or regulations difficulty in obtaining export licenses potentially adverse tax or labor laws the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws longer payment cycles typically associated with international sales other factors outside our control we expect these risks to increase in the future as we expand our operations in eastern europe  latin america  and asia 
we cannot provide any assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in the future 
our manufacturing operations may be materially affected by weather related risks we manufacture and assemble a significant portion of our products in puerto rico 
our ability to perform these activities may be significantly affected by weather related risks beyond our control 
we believe that if the puerto rico facility were significantly affected by adverse weather  we could relocate to an alternative facility within a reasonable period of time  however  we cannot provide any assurance that we would be able to relocate that facility without a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we may be materially affected by restructuring activities we have recognized significant restructuring charges in the past and it is possible that changes in our business  industry  or in the global economy may necessitate restructuring activities in the future 
the necessity for restructuring activities may result in expenses that adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and may require incremental cash payments
