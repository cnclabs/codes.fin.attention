item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview viad corp viad operates in two business segments as follows payment services through travelers express company  inc and related subsidiaries travelers express  revenues are derived from transaction fees and investment and related income by providing various services related to money orders  official checks  money transfers  same day bill payment and cash access services 
fee revenues are driven by transaction volume and contract pricing through a network of agents and customers  including financial institutions 
investment and related income is generated through a float portfolio of investments 
convention and event services through ges exposition services  inc ges  revenues are generated from providing various convention and tradeshow services such as transportation  installation  dismantling and management services to trade associations  show management companies and exhibitors 
exhibitgroup giltspur exhibitgroup specializes in the design  construction  installation and warehousing of convention and tradeshow exhibits  primarily for corporate customers 
viad also operates certain travel and recreation businesses 
in  viad s two principal business segments achieved profitability improvements  despite market challenges and difficult economic conditions 
payment services experienced increased transaction volume and higher investment balances  however  operating income growth was slowed due to significantly lower interest rates and unprecedented mortgage refinancing activity 
convention and event services produced profitable results despite decreased demand for new exhibit construction and tradeshow shrinkage 
viad also improved its financial strength during the year through increased cash and investment balances and a reduction in total debt obligations 
financial performance highlights for are presented below for viad corp consolidated and its payment services and convention and event services businesses 
see results of operations and liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion 
the following financial highlights are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and are compared to amounts as adjusted for the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

the information is supplemental to results presented under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
this supplemental information includes the following payment services invests in a mix of tax exempt and taxable investments 
the tax exempt investments have lower pre tax yields but produce higher income on an after tax basis than comparable taxable investments 
an adjustment is made to the payment services segment to present revenues and operating income resulting from amounts invested in tax exempt securities on a taxable equivalent basis 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation to gaap 
ebitda is a measure of viad s ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures and finance growth  and should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
ebitda is defined by viad as income before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  changes in accounting principles and includes the taxable equivalent adjustment 
a reconciliation of ebitda to net income is as follows in thousands ebitda as presented less interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization change in accounting principle taxable equivalent adjustment net income viad has historically presented ebitda before restructuring charges and other items 
the above presentation of ebitda includes restructuring charges and other items in conformity with the sec s final rule of conditions for use of non gaap financial measures and is a change from viad s historical ebitda presentation 
the million increase in ebitda in is largely due to decreased restructuring charges and other items in as compared to of million 
the million decrease in ebitda from to is predominantly due to increased restructuring charges and other items in as compared to of million 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which include the accounts of viad and all of its subsidiaries 
all per share figures discussed are stated on the diluted basis 

table of contents results of operations during  the convention and event services segment continued to experience tradeshow shrinkage and further declines in the demand for the design and construction of new exhibits 
this decline was due to diminished corporate spending and the continued downturn in the general economy as many exhibitors elected to reuse or refurbish existing exhibits rather than place new orders 
as a result of decreased visibility over future revenues and continued uncertainties regarding improvements in the tradeshow industry  the convention and event services segment revised its forecasted demand and reevaluated its manufacturing capacity requirements and cost structure during the fourth quarter of accordingly  viad recorded a fourth quarter restructuring charge totaling million million after tax of which million relating to consulting fees incurred and the write down of certain inventories was charged to costs of products sold in the consolidated statements of income 
the remaining million was classified under the caption restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of income 
the restructuring relates to the closure and consolidation of certain facilities  severance and other costs related to the elimination of approximately positions across numerous regions  business functions and job classes 
the charge also includes amounts for the disposal net of estimated proceeds of certain inventories and fixed assets  facility closure and lease termination costs net of estimated sublease income and other exit costs 
viad expects to substantially complete the restructuring activities by december   however  payments due under long term lease obligations will continue to be made over the remaining terms of the lease agreements 
severance and benefits payments will be made over the varying terms of the individual separation agreements 
viad expects that the restructuring charge will result in cost savings in the range of million to million in based on the timing of activities pursuant to the restructuring plan 
during  the convention and event services segment recorded a restructuring charge of million million after tax for which the related restructuring activities had been completed by the end of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  viad adopted sfas no 
which requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment 
concurrent with the adoption of sfas no 
 viad performed the transitional impairment testing of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
viad determined that no impairment existed for other intangible assets but a transitional impairment loss of million million after tax was recorded related to goodwill at the exhibitgroup giltspur reporting unit of the convention and event services segment 
see critical accounting policies for additional discussion related to goodwill impairment testing 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  viad contemplated an initial public offering and subsequent spin off of travelers express 
further consideration and implementation of the initial public offering and spin off was delayed pending improvement in overall economic and capital market conditions 
viad will continue to evaluate strategic options in order to enhance long term value for its stockholders 
vs 
revenues for were billion  down slightly from the amount of billion 
viad s payment services segment revenue increased by million over the prior year  while the convention and event services segment revenue decreased by million over the same period 
viad also had a slight decline in its hospitality and recreation services businesses 
viad s payment services subsidiaries invest a portion of funds received from the sale of official checks  money orders and other payment instruments in tax exempt securities  which have lower pre tax yields but produce higher income on an after tax basis than comparable taxable investments 
even though nontaxable investments generally have higher after tax yields than taxable investments  viad has shifted its mix of nontaxable and taxable investments to balance its alternative minimum tax position 
at december   tax exempt investments represented percent of the total investment portfolio versus percent at december  on a taxable equivalent basis  as though amounts were invested in taxable investments  revenues were billion  down slightly from the amount of billion 

table of contents net income for was million  or per share  as compared with the amount of million  or per share million  or per share when adjusted for sfas no 

there were  additional average outstanding and potentially dilutive common shares in than in this was largely driven by significant stock option exercise activity during the first half of  partially offset by the resumption of the stock repurchase program described in liquidity and capital resources 
payment services 
revenues of the payment services segment were million in  a percent increase over revenues of million 
operating income was million  a percent increase over operating income of million or up percent from million when adjusted for sfas no 

operating margins increased to percent in from percent in or from percent when adjusting for the impact of sfas no 

on a taxable equivalent basis  revenues of million were up percent when compared to million in on the same basis  segment operating income in was million  up percent from million in or up percent from million in when adjusted for sfas no 

the increase in operating income was driven by continued growth in the moneygram business 
payment services experienced double digit growth in the number of locations that sell or provide both money orders and money transfer services  including  us wal mart locations 
moneygram continued to show strong results with transaction volume growing percent from to  led by strong international money transfer and same day bill payment volume 
moneygram s agent base expanded by percent over growth in the us to mexico corridor was down slightly over  however moneygram s fixed price product  cambio plus  continues to grow in the high teens on a percentage basis 
the january acquisition of the minority interest in moneygram international limited mil is expected to be slightly accretive to earnings in mil provides money transfer services primarily in europe  africa  australia and asia and has experienced significant growth in revenues  transaction volume and agent locations over the last two years 
mil s growth is expected to continue through increased transaction volume and further expansion of its agent network in international markets 
the money order business continues to contribute significantly to operating margin and cash flows  however  money order volume and related average investable balances were down slightly compared to as some agents were eliminated and fewer agents were approved in order to manage the credit quality of the money order business 
average investable funds for were billion  up percent from levels primarily driven by the official check business 
the float income generated from the investment of these funds investment income from the investment portfolio represented approximately percent of total payment services revenue in compared with percent for float income is affected by the level of investment balances float portfolio and the yield on investments 
the following tables present float income and expense associated with the payment services segment s investment portfolio on both a gaap and taxable equivalent basis average income yield average income yield balance expense rate balance expense rate in thousands  gaap basis investments available or restricted for payment service obligations payment service obligations net float income and margin 
table of contents average income yield average income yield balance expense rate balance expense rate in thousands  taxable equivalent basis investments available or restricted for payment service obligations payment service obligations net float income and margin commissions are paid to financial institution customers based upon average outstanding balances generated by the sale of official check products only 
the expense reported includes those payments made to financial institution customers  costs associated with swaps and the sale of receivables program 
the average balance in the table reflects only the payment service obligations for which commissions are paid and does not include the average balance of the sold receivables million and million for and  respectively as these are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
commission expense is classified as costs of services in the consolidated statements of income 
on a gaap basis  float income excluding gains was million in compared to million in  an increase of percent 
the growth was primarily due to higher average float portfolio balances  which increased by billion or percent 
the float income increase attributable to the balance growth was million and was partially offset by a decrease of million due to an interest rate decline  reflecting an average investment yield of percent  or a basis point decline from percent in on a taxable equivalent basis  float income was million compared to million in  an increase of percent 
higher balance growth drove the increase of million in float income and was partially offset by a million decrease in float income related to declining interest rates 
this resulted in an average investment yield of percent  a decrease of basis points from percent in during  average year us treasury notes declined basis points and short term interest rates declined over basis points 
the payment services segment maintains approximately million to million in short term  highly liquid balances in order to fulfill its payment service obligations 
lower yields were earned on these short term balances during due to interest rate declines 
in addition  the dramatic decline in interest rates resulted in unprecedented and volatile mortgage refinancing activity during refinancing activities caused an increase in the sale of official checks and an increase in float balances 
the refinancing activity also drove a significant increase in the prepayments of mortgage backed debt securities  resulting in the investment of these funds at lower interest rates 
also contributing to the decline in average investment yield in was a lower percentage of the portfolio invested in the higher after tax yield municipal securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a detail of investments available or restricted for payment service obligations 
if the unprecedented mortgage refinancing activity continues  future results could be affected similarly 
commission expense was million in  an increase of million  or percent from  primarily due to higher average balances of billion 
the commission expense increase attributable to the higher average balances was million and was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million due to lower interest rates 
commission expense includes amounts paid to financial institution customers based upon their average outstanding balances generated by the sale of official check products as well as the discount on the sale of certain agent receivables 
in addition  commission expense includes the impact of the variable to fixed rate swap agreements that are used to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on financial institution commission expense and on the net proceeds from the sale of agent receivables 
net float income float income less commission expense on a gaap basis was million in  up million or percent from  primarily due to increased balances 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in interest rates  reflecting a net float margin of percent  or a basis point decline from percent in the margin decline was a result of a lower interest rate environment as short term and float balances earned lower yields and proceeds from prepayments and sales were reinvested at lower 
table of contents yields 
as mentioned above  refinancing activities caused an increase in the sale of official checks and therefore an increase in float balances 
however  a substantial portion of these balances were invested at short term interest rates equal to or less than the interest rates paid out in commissions to financial institution customers  thus reducing net float margin 
although commissions and the discount on the sale of receivables program benefited from lower short term interest rates  the fixed rate derivatives used to mitigate the effects of fluctuations on these expenses have contractual maturities  and therefore  did not benefit from reduced interest rates 
also contributing to the margin decline was a change in product mix reflecting higher overall growth in the official check business  which has lower net float margins relative to the money order business 
on a taxable equivalent basis  net float income was million in  up million or percent from the following tables summarize the impact of changes in average investable balances and interest rates on the float income and commission expense associated with the investment portfolio on a gaap and taxable equivalent basis vs yield yield balance rate total balance rate total in thousands  gaap basis in thousands  taxable equivalent basis float income commission expense net float income the totals for the balance and rate columns are not the sum of the individual lines as income and expense changes are calculated independently 
one of the payment services business objectives in managing the float portfolio is to mitigate the risk to earnings created by changing interest rates 
to mitigate that risk  interest rate derivatives are entered into which effectively limit exposure to the floating rate commission payments to financial institution customers 
these derivatives effectively convert the variable interest rate to a fixed rate 
the fair value of these derivatives can fluctuate with interest rate changes  reflected as increases or decreases to a component of stockholders equity 
changes in the value of the available for sale investment portfolio also are reflected as increases and decreases to a component of stockholders equity 
the change in the fair value of the derivative liability for was a net decrease of million in stockholders equity  while the net change in the fair value of the available for sale investment portfolio was a net increase of million in stockholders equity 
changes in the value of the available for sale investment portfolio will generally move in the opposite direction of the derivative values although they will rarely offset 
this is because the main objective in entering into the derivatives is to first mitigate the risk on earnings due to the change in interest rates and secondarily to mitigate the risk to equity 
certain payment services segment challenges include among others if interest rates stay low and refinancing activity continues to be strong  revenue and operating income growth could continue to be constrained 
a tight credit environment which slows new agent signings and necessitates cutting some existing agents  and competitive pricing pressures  particularly for domestic business 
the payment services segment will respond to these challenges by focusing on profitable growth that meets its margin requirements and that viad believes will enhance its stockholder value 
convention and event services 
revenues of the convention and event services segment were million in  a decrease of percent from revenues of million 
operating income was million in compared to an operating loss of million in or an operating loss of million when adjusted for sfas no 

before restructuring charges and other items  operating income was million  an increase of percent from million in and operating margins were 
table of contents percent and percent in and  respectively 
when adjusting for the impact of sfas no 
 income before restructuring charges and other items would have been million with a corresponding operating margin of percent 
within the convention and event services segment  the exhibit and design business experienced a percent decrease in revenues during the year 
exhibit design and construction revenues were million in compared to million in revenues were negatively impacted by further declines in the demand for the design and construction of new exhibits 
this decline was due to diminished corporate spending and the continued downturn in the general economy as many exhibitors elected to reuse or refurbish existing exhibits rather than placing new orders 
operating income performance was poor during primarily due to the decline in revenues  excess manufacturing capacity  and certain inefficiencies 
as a result of decreased visibility over revenues and continued uncertainties regarding improvements in the tradeshow industry  viad approved a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of resulting in a restructuring charge of million million after tax 
the components of the million charge consist of facility closure and lease termination costs of million net of estimated sublease income of million  asset impairments related to fixed assets and inventories of million  employee severance and benefits of million and other charges of  as of december   a remaining liability related to this restructuring of million is included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the restructuring plan is primarily focused on cost reductions through centralizing manufacturing capacity from five locations to three and centralizing certain support functions 
approximately positions will be eliminated in connection with the restructuring 
future revenues and operating income could be adversely impacted if there are further declines in corporate spending for exhibit construction  despite management s plans to reduce costs 
viad expects to substantially complete the restructuring activities by december   however  payments due under the long term lease obligations will continue to be made over the remaining terms of the lease agreements 
severance and benefits payments will be made over the varying terms of the individual separation agreements 
viad expects that the restructuring charge will result in cost savings in the range of million to million in based on the timing of activities pursuant to the restructuring plan 
see critical accounting policies for additional discussion of accounting method related to the restructuring 
during  the convention and event services segment recorded a restructuring charge of million million after tax for which the related restructuring activities were completed by the end of as of december   a remaining liability of million related to the restructuring is included in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the convention show services business experienced a percent decrease in revenues  however  operating income increased during the year 
revenues were million in compared to million in the decline in revenues largely reflects lower demand for services and tradeshow shrinkage due to overall weak economic conditions 
since  and throughout  the tradeshow industry has experienced sequential declines in tradeshow attendance  the number of exhibiting companies  and convention square footage 
tradeshow activity also reflects industry specific conditions 
show shrinkage has been significant in the technology and telecommunications sectors  while health related shows have slightly improved and other service industries have stabilized 
during  several shows were canceled  scaled back or lost to competitors 
furthermore  show shrinkage  particularly related to certain technology shows  negatively impacted revenues 
however  these declines were partially offset by new business in such as the comdex and international manufacturing technology shows  and positive show rotation related to the conexpo conag and international woodworking shows  as these events do not occur every year 
operating income improvements during primarily reflect improved margins and lower costs as the benefit of a previous restructuring has largely been realized 
although the convention show services business has a diversified revenue base show portfolio including existing contracts for future shows  revenue growth is dependent on general economic and industry specific conditions 
furthermore  political instability in the middle east and threats of terrorism could continue to impact travel which may adversely affect the convention show industry 
travel and recreation services 
revenues of the travel and recreation businesses decreased million  or percent  to million in operating income for the travel and recreation businesses was million  a decrease of percent from that of operating margins for and were 
table of contents percent and percent  respectively 
when adjusting for the impact of sfas no 
 operating income would have been million with a decrease of percent and the operating margin would have been percent 
the revenue decrease resulted primarily from a continued decline in the world travel market 
despite declines in tourism and the soft economy  these businesses had a respectable year from a revenue standpoint and will continue to focus on cost control until world travel returns to previous levels 
as with convention and event services  political instability in the middle east and threats of terrorism resulting in reduced travel could continue to impact the travel and recreation services businesses 
corporate activities 
corporate activities expense increased million from to this increase is due largely to million for legal  investment banking  and other costs incurred in connection with a contemplated initial public offering of travelers express 
additional increases relate to higher insurance premiums and employee benefit costs in corporate activities expense is expected to increase in due to higher pension costs and insurance premium expense 
other investment income 
investment income increased million due primarily to million of interest income received associated with a federal income tax refund for the through tax years as well as an increase in investment income associated with corporate securities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements due to higher average investment levels during  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in as a result of steadily declining average outstanding debt balances and average interest rates throughout the year 
approximately percent and percent of the average debt outstanding during and  respectively  related to short term borrowings that are subject to variable interest rates 
minority interests 
the increase in minority interests of million in from relates to strong growth in the payment services segment s percent interest in mil 
in january  viad purchased the remaining percent interest in mil as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
on a gaap basis  the effective tax rate was percent  up from a percent tax benefit in predominantly due to the restructuring charges and other items recorded in excluding the effect of the and restructuring charges and other items  the effective tax rate was percent  up from percent in when adjusted for the impact of sfas no 
the effective tax rate in would have been percent 
the relatively low rate compared to the statutory federal rate is primarily attributable to tax exempt income from viad s payment services businesses 
the higher rate for is due to lower tax exempt investment income in proportion to total pre tax income  resulting from the shift in the mix of investments from nontaxable to taxable investments 
even though nontaxable investments generally have higher after tax yields than taxable investments  viad has shifted its mix of nontaxable and taxable investments to balance its alternative minimum tax position 
this change in the mix of investments  the taxability of those investments  and the mix of companies included in the consolidated state filings  increased viad s effective tax rate from to vs 
in the third quarter  viad recorded restructuring charges totaling million million after tax associated with the closure and consolidation of certain facilities  severance and other employee benefits of which million relating to the write down of certain inventories was charged to cost of products sold 
the remaining million was classified under the caption restructuring charges 
all facilities were closed or consolidated and all of the positions had been eliminated as of december  payments under long term lease obligations  however  will continue to be made over the remaining terms of the leases 
severance and benefits payments will be made over the varying terms of the individual separation agreements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on this charge and a rollforward of the restructuring liability at december  the following discussion compares results with results as originally reported and also on an as adjusted for sfas no 
basis 

table of contents revenues for were billion  down from the amount of billion 
the decrease was primarily due to viad s convention and event services segment revenue decline of million over the prior year  partially offset by the payment services segment revenue increase of million over the same period 
viad began shifting its mix of nontaxable and taxable investments in to balance its alternative minimum tax position 
at december   tax exempt investments represented percent of the total investment portfolio versus percent at december  on a taxable equivalent basis  as though amounts were invested in taxable investments  revenues were billion  down percent from billion in net income for was million  or per share  compared with net income of million  or per share in when adjusted for sfas no 
 net income would have been million per share versus million per share in there were million fewer average outstanding and potentially dilutive common shares in than in  due primarily to the stock repurchase programs described in liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  a lower viad stock price during contributed to fewer additional dilutive shares related to unexercised stock options 
payment services 
revenues of the payment services segment were million in  a percent increase over revenues of million 
operating income was million  a percent increase over operating income of million 
operating margins increased to percent in from percent in when adjusting and for the impact of sfas no 
 operating income would have been million and million  respectively  and the operating margins would have been percent and percent in and  respectively 
the increase in operating income was driven by continuing solid growth in official check operations  continued improvements in moneygram and by the leveraging of the existing infrastructure  as payment services experienced double digit growth in the number of financial institution locations and in the number of locations that sell or provide both money orders and money transfer services 
moneygram experienced strong transaction volume growth of percent driven by latin america  international money transfer and same day bill payment businesses

on a gaap basis  float income excluding gains was million in compared to million in  an increase of million or percent 
the growth was primarily due to higher average float portfolio balances which drove an increase in float income of million 
during  average year us treasury notes declined basis points and short term interest rates declined over basis points 
despite this decline  the average portfolio yield increased basis points from percent to percent  primarily due to the mix of investments in the portfolio 
the portfolio mix shifted away from lower yield tax exempt securities into higher yield taxable securities as the percentage of the portfolio invested in tax exempt securities declined from percent at december  to percent at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a breakout of investments available or restricted for payment service obligations

convention and event services 
revenues of the convention and event services segment were million in  a decrease of percent from revenues of billion 
on a gaap basis  the operating loss in of million was significantly below the operating income of million 
the decline was driven by the million of restructuring charges and other items expensed in before restructuring charges and other items  operating income was million  a decrease of percent from the operating income of million 
on this basis  operating margins decreased to percent in from percent in when adjusting and for the impact of sfas no 
 income before restructuring charges and other items would have been million and million  respectively  with operating margins of percent and percent  respectively 
the convention and event services segment s exhibit and design business has suffered from the events of september th and the negative implications to the tradeshow industry that resulted 
the general malaise in the economy  further damaged with terrorist threats after september th and resulting travel concerns caused many customers to delay or cancel exhibit construction  opting instead to refurbish old exhibits  thus directly impacting revenues 
as such  revenues were down percent to million in the convention and event services segment s convention show services was affected by the overall softness in the economy  the technology and telecom decline  the events of september th and negative show rotation 
fear of travel as a result of the events of september th negatively impacted tradeshow attendance and resulted in increased show cancellations  and thus reduced revenues 
in addition  certain large tradeshows held in were not held in negative show rotation therefore adversely impacting year over year revenues 
finally  year over year revenue was negatively impacted by the loss of tradeshows of the keymedia group  inc keymedia  as discussed below 
as a result of the above  revenues were down percent to million in from although progress was being made with regard to the restructuring  the benefits had not yet been fully realized and were further dampened by the dramatic drop in attendance after the events of september th 
in august  keymedia  a company spun off by ziff davis inc  terminated a long term agreement with ges to produce tradeshows 
the companies had been involved in litigation regarding the contract termination 
the key issues in the litigation related to the interpretation of certain contract terms and the scope of free services required of ges 
during the second quarter of  after both sides assessed the business market  the risks and demands of the litigation and the need to move forward on a productive basis  ges and keymedia agreed to settle the litigation 
as a result  viad recorded a charge totaling million million after tax in the second quarter of representing primarily the write off of net receivables 
table of contents and prepayments made to keymedia 
the million charge was recorded under the caption litigation settlement and costs in the consolidated statements of income 
as a result of the above factors and the general downturn in the economy  viad approved the restructuring plan previously discussed 
travel and recreation services 
revenues of the travel and recreation businesses decreased million  or percent  to million in the revenue decrease resulted primarily from an overall decrease in traffic from japanese and european tourists and from a decrease in overall package tours and charter volumes 
the declines in tourism were reflective of the soft economy  higher fuel costs and the september th terrorist attacks 
operating income for the travel and recreation businesses was million  a decrease of million  or percent  from that of levels  primarily due to reduced tourism volume 
when adjusting and for the impact of sfas no 
 operating income would have been million and million  respectively  and operating margins would have been percent and percent in and  respectively 
corporate activities 
the million increase in corporate activities expense from to was due primarily to a write down of a partnership interest resulting from its impairment  deemed to be other than temporary 
other investment income 
investment income associated with corporate securities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements declined million due primarily to lower average investment levels in as funds were used for stock repurchases primarily in the first quarter of as described in liquidity and capital resources 
lower average interest rates during also contributed to the decline 
minority interests 
the decrease of  in minority interests from relates primarily to a  minority interest tax adjustment made in  partially offset by an increase in revenue and transaction volume growth in the payment services segment s percent interest in mil 
interest expense 
interest expense increased slightly to million in from million in  primarily as a result of slightly higher average debt outstanding during the year  substantially offset by lower average interest rates

the effective tax rate in and would have been percent and percent  respectively 
the relatively low rate compared to the statutory federal rate is primarily attributable to tax exempt income from viad s payment services businesses 
the higher rate for is due to lower tax exempt investment income in proportion to total pre tax income  resulting from the shift in the mix of investments from nontaxable to taxable investments 
in addition  due to lower operating income in the convention and event services segment  tax savings associated with filing consolidated state income tax returns was lower than anticipated  resulting in a higher effective state tax rate

under a shelf registration filed in with the securities and exchange commission  viad can issue up to an aggregate million of debt and equity securities 
in  viad filed an amended shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission to update disclosures in the original registration and to maintain viad s financial flexibility 
no securities have been issued under the program 
viad authorized a stock repurchase program in for the purpose of replacing common shares issued upon exercise of stock options and in connection with other stock compensation plans  with the intended effect of reducing dilution caused by the issuance of such shares 
this program was on hold for most of and the first six months of while cash was conserved given the uncertainty in the economy 
in the third quarter of  viad resumed the repurchase plan and acquired million shares for million at an average price of 
prior to the break in the stock repurchase program  million shares were repurchased in early for million at an average price of 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options  including tax benefits on stock option exercises  totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the level of future cash generated from stock option exercises may vary depending on viad s stock price compared to the option exercise price and the ability of the grantees to exercise stock options 
with respect to working capital  in order to minimize the effects of borrowing costs on earnings  viad strives to maintain current assets at the lowest practicable levels while at the same time taking advantage of payment terms offered by trade creditors and obtaining advance deposits from customers for certain projects and services 
however  working capital requirements may fluctuate from seasonal factors as well as changes in levels of receivables and inventories caused by numerous business factors 
viad satisfies a portion of its working capital and other financing requirements with short term borrowings through commercial paper  bank note programs and bank lines of credit 
effective august   viad completed credit facilities totaling million to replace and consolidate its previous million revolving bank credit agreement  various letter of credit support facilities and a canadian credit facility without substantially increasing viad s overall credit capacity 
under these facilities  short term borrowings were supported by a million short term day revolving credit facility with a one year term out provision  at viad s option  in the event a new facility is not established and a million five year facility 
on august   viad s million short term day facility was amended  the total amount of the lenders commitments was reduced to million under similar terms and the commitment termination date of each eligible lender was extended to august the short term revolving credit facility  as amended  allows for viad to increase the aggregate amount of the lender commitments up to million subject to availability of commitments 
short term borrowings totaling million and million at december  and  respectively  have been classified as long term debt  pursuant to the unused commitments under the applicable long term and short term credit facilities 
unused commitments net of amounts used to support short term borrowings and letters of credit under the facilities totaled million at december  borrowings under the facilities are subject to various covenants  including standard equity and other financial ratio calculations  among others 
the borrowings are also subject to increases in borrowing costs if debt ratings are not maintained at current levels 
default under the covenants relating to any of viad s debt agreements could result in cross defaults to other debt agreements 
viad is currently in compliance with all of its covenants 

table of contents the following table presents viad s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases derivative financial instruments other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations other long term obligations include million of expected pension funding obligations and million of commission obligation payments 
in december  ges began occupying and commenced lease payments on a newly constructed facility in las vegas  nevada 
the leased property provides ges with approximately  square feet of combined warehouse  manufacturing and office space 
the lease term is years and the aggregate base rental payments over the lease term are approximately million 
the lease was accounted for as an operating lease  and as such  is not included on viad s consolidated balance sheets as of december  the amounts relating to the lease are included under the caption operating leases in the above table 
as of december   viad had certain obligations under guarantees to third parties on behalf of its subsidiaries 
these guarantees are not subject to liability recognition in the consolidated financial statements and primarily relate to leased facilities and credit or loan arrangements with banks  entered into by viad s subsidiary operations 
viad would generally be required to make payments to the respective third parties under these guarantees in the event that the related subsidiary could not meet its own payment obligations 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that viad would be required to make under all guarantees existing at december  would be million 
of these guarantees  percent relate to obligations associated with operating leases and other unused credit facilities and the remaining percent relates to subsidiary obligations included in total debt in the consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the aggregate guarantees related to leased facilities were million  and expire through december at december   the aggregate guarantees related to credit or loan arrangements with banks were million of which  million expire through september and million is subject to an ongoing guarantee by a viad subsidiary commensurate with its subsidiary s credit facility which has no expiration date 
there are no recourse provisions that would enable viad to recover from third parties any payments made under the guarantees 
furthermore  there are no collateral or similar arrangements whereby viad could recover payments 
the ability of viad to maintain its investment grade rating is critical as it affects the cost of borrowing 
in addition  certain financial institution customers of viad s payment services segment require that viad maintain an investment grade rating 
any ratings downgrade could increase viad s cost of borrowing  result in termination of debt  or require certain actions be performed to rectify such a situation 
such a downgrade could also have a negative effect on viad s ability to attract and retain new or existing customers 
being placed on credit watch with negative implication could also affect viad s cost of borrowing for its short term debt and or the ability to obtain such short term funding 
currently  the ratings outlook from the rating agencies is stable 
payment services has agreements with clearing banks that provide processing and clearing functions for money orders and official checks 
certain contracts have covenants that require the maintenance of specified levels of capital for viad s payment services operations 
any changes in specified capital levels may require additional capital contributions to be made by viad to payment services and or may require payment services to change the mix of its investments or increase the level of investment liquidity  which could result in lower rates of return 

table of contents capital spending has been reduced by obtaining  where appropriate  equipment and other property under operating leases 
cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sales of noncore businesses and assets during the past three years have generally been sufficient to fund capital expenditures  acquire businesses and pay cash dividends to stockholders 
although no assurance can be given  viad expects operating cash flows and short term borrowings to be sufficient to finance its ongoing business  maintain adequate capital levels and meet covenant and investment grade rating requirements 
should financing requirements exceed such sources of funds  viad believes it has adequate external financing sources available  including unused commitments under its credit facilities  to cover any shortfall 
viad s payment services subsidiaries generate funds from the sale of official checks  money orders and other payment instruments  with the related liabilities classified as payment service obligations 
substantially all of the proceeds of such sales are invested in permissible securities  principally high quality debt instruments 
these investments are restricted by the payment services segment to the extent that they represent proceeds from the sale of its payment instruments for use by the subsidiaries to satisfy the liability to pay  upon presentment  the face amount of such payment service obligations 
accordingly  such assets are not available to satisfy working capital or other financing requirements of viad 
the securities are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption  investments available or restricted for payment service obligations 
certain additional assets of the payment services subsidiaries relating to payment service obligations  including cash on hand  funds in transit from agents and securities expected to be sold or maturing within one year  are included under the caption  funds  agent receivables and current maturities of investments available or restricted for payment service obligations 
although the payment services investment portfolio exposes viad to certain credit risks  viad believes the high quality of the investments reduces this risk 
approximately percent of the investments at december  and approximately percent of the investments at december  have an investment grade rating of a or higher or are collateralized by federal agency securities 
although payment services investment portfolio is highly diversified  if any one issuer were unable to pay its obligations or were to enter into bankruptcy  payment services may have to sell the investment and reinvest the proceeds in permissible securities and or could lose a portion or a substantial amount of the investment with such issuer 
in addition  further deterioration in the debt and equity markets could lead to other than temporary impairment losses related to the payment services segment s investment securities in future periods 
see critical accounting policies for discussion regarding estimates and assumptions related to other than temporary declines in the value of securities 
under normal circumstances there is no requirement to sell long term debt securities prior to their maturity  as the funds from ongoing sales of money orders and other payment instruments and funds from maturing long term and short term investments are expected to be adequate to settle payment service obligations as they are presented 
fluctuations in the balances of payment services assets and obligations result from varying levels of sales of money orders and other payment instruments  the timing of agent receivables  and the timing of the presentment of such instruments 
working in cooperation with certain financial institutions  payment services has established separate consolidated entities special purpose entities and processes that provide these financial institutions with additional assurance of the ability to clear their official checks 
these processes include maintenance of specified ratios of segregated investments to outstanding payment instruments 
in some cases  alternative credit support has been purchased by payment services that provides backstop funding as additional security for payment of their instruments 
however  payment services remains liable to satisfy the obligations 
accordingly  the obligations have been recorded in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption payment service obligations 
under certain limited circumstances  clients have rights to demand liquidation of the segregated assets or to take other similar actions 
while an orderly liquidation of assets would be required  any such actions by a client could nonetheless diminish the value of the total investment portfolio  decrease earnings  and result in loss of the client or other customers or prospects 
a viad payment services subsidiary has an agreement to sell  on a periodic basis  undivided percentage ownership interests in certain receivables from bill payment and money order agents in an amount not to exceed million 
the agreement runs through june  but the decision to sell receivables is made daily 

table of contents in addition  there is no requirement for the purchasing bank to purchase the receivables 
the receivables are sold in order to accelerate payment services cash flow for investments in permissible securities 
viad s payment services subsidiaries have various lines of credit  overdraft facilities and reverse repurchase agreements totaling billion available to assist in the management of their investments and the clearing of payment service obligations 
no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at december  or the payment services segment has agreements with certain investors to provide funds related to investments in collateralized private equity obligations 
as of december   the total amount of unfunded commitments related to these agreements was million 
viad sold treasury stock in to viad s employee equity trust the trust to fund certain existing employee compensation and benefit plans over the scheduled year term of the trust 
for financial reporting purposes  the trust is consolidated with viad 
the fair market value of the shares held by the trust  representing unearned employee benefits  is recorded as a deduction from common stock and other equity and is reduced as employee benefits are funded 
at december   approximately  shares remained in the trust and were available to fund future benefit obligations 
viad has certain unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans that require payments over extended periods of time 
such future benefit payments are not expected to materially affect viad s liquidity 
viad is subject to various environmental laws and regulations of the united states as well as of the states and other countries in whose jurisdictions viad has or had operations and is subject to certain international agreements 
as is the case with many companies  viad faces exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters 
although viad is a party to certain environmental disputes  viad believes that any liabilities resulting therefrom  after taking into consideration amounts already provided for  exclusive of any potential insurance recovery  have been properly reserved for  however  environmental settlements could result in future cash outlays 
off balance sheet arrangements viad has certain arrangements or transactions which are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and could materially effect liquidity or require the use of capital resources 
these arrangements and transactions are discussed in liquidity and capital resources  and include aggregate operating lease commitments of million including the ges lease commitment of million  aggregate guarantees of million and funding commitments related to collateralized private equity obligations of million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this criteria  viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates  and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates goodwill 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires annual impairment testing of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of viad s reporting units 
the fair value of viad s reporting units is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital rate 
additionally  an assumed terminal value is used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal values and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based on historical experience  financial forecasts  and industry trends and conditions 

table of contents during  viad recorded a transitional goodwill impairment loss of million million after tax related to the exhibitgroup giltspur reporting unit of the convention and event services segment 
a decline in the expected cash flows or the estimated terminal value could lead to additional goodwill impairment losses 
similarly  an increase in the discount rate weighted average cost of capital could also result in additional goodwill impairment 
insurance liabilities 
viad is self insured up to certain limits for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability  property loss and medical claims 
viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with the sales of businesses 
provisions for losses for claims incurred  including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported  are made based on viad s prior historical experience  claims frequency and other factors 
viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self insured levels 
a change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities 
pension obligations 
viad has trusteed  noncontributory pension plans that cover certain employees 
pension benefits are supplemented  in most cases  by defined matching company stock contributions to employees k plans as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  viad retained the obligations for such benefits for employees of certain sold businesses 
through december   the principal retirement plan was structured using a traditional defined benefit formula based primarily on final average pay and years of service 
benefits earned under this formula ceased accruing at december   with no change to retirement benefits earned through that date 
effective january   benefits began accruing under a cash accumulation account formula based upon a percentage of pay plus interest 
funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations 
certain defined pension benefits  primarily those in excess of benefit levels permitted under qualified pension plans  are unfunded 
as determined with the guidance of an external actuary  the following assumptions were used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension expense discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase viad s pension expense was million and million for and  respectively 
pension expense is calculated based upon the actuarial assumptions shown above 
for  the pension expense consisted of service cost of million  interest cost of million  amortization of prior service cost of  recognized net actuarial loss of  less an expected return on plan assets of million 
the fair value of viad s pension plan assets decreased to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to benefits paid and lower actual returns on plan assets 
viad s discount rate used in determining future pension obligations is measured on november and is based on rates determined by actuarial analysis and viad management review 
lowering the discount rate by percent would have increased viad s pension expense by  in developing the expected rate of return  input provided by viad s actuaries was evaluated as well as other external factors 
viad s expected rate of return is based on asset allocation guidelines that are reviewed quarterly by its pension investment committee and assets are invested in a manner consistent with the fiduciary standards of the employee retirement income security act erisa 
to be consistent with erisa fiduciary standards  the assets should have the safeguards and diversity to which a prudent investor would adhere and all transactions undertaken on behalf of the fund must be for the sole benefit of plan participants and their beneficiaries 
viad s current asset allocation consists of approximately percent in large capitalization and international equities  approximately percent in fixed income such as long term treasury bonds  intermediate government bonds and global bonds and approximately percent in a real estate limited partnership interest 
lowering the expected rate of return by percent would have increased viad s pension expense by  viad s pension assets are primarily invested in marketable securities that have readily determinable current market values 
viad s investments are re balanced regularly to stay within 
table of contents the investment guidelines 
viad will continue to evaluate its pension assumptions  including its rate of return  and will adjust these factors as necessary 
future actual pension income or expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in viad s pension plans 
postretirement benefits other than pensions 
viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees  retirees and dependents 
the related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees 
in addition  viad retained the obligations for such benefits for retirees of certain sold businesses 
while the plans have no funding requirements  viad may fund the plans 
the assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was percent for the year  gradually declining to percent by the year and remaining at that level thereafter 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the ongoing annual expense by approximately  a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and the ongoing annual expense by approximately  weighted average assumptions used at december were as follows discount rate expected return on plan assets investment securities 
investment securities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
per sfas no 
 investments are classified into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
securities being held for indefinite periods of time  including those securities that may be sold to assist in the clearing of payment service obligations or in the management of securities  are classified as available for sale 
these securities are carried at market value or fair value  with the net after tax unrealized gain or loss reported as a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
market value is determined by using available market information 
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates determined may not be indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
in general  as interest rates increase  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio and stockholders equity decreases and as interest rates fall  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio increases as well as stockholders equity 
securities classified as held to maturity are those that management has the ability and intent to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the cost of investment securities sold is determined using the specific identification method 
other than temporary declines in the value of securities 
viad s investments consist primarily of mortgage backed securities  other asset backed securities  state and municipal government obligations and corporate debt securities 
investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
viad employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments including the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than book value  viad s ability and intent to hold the investment  the security rating  the underlying collateral and other factors that influence projected future cash flows 
when an other than temporary impairment occurs  investments are written down to fair market value 
subsequent increases in value are treated as an adjustment of yield 

table of contents derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are used as part of viad s risk management strategy to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates 
viad does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes 
derivatives are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related amendments and interpretations 
the derivatives are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value  with the change in fair value recognized in earnings or in other comprehensive income depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
a derivative that does not qualify  or is not designated  as a hedge will be reflected at fair value  with changes in value recognized through earnings 
the estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments has been determined using available market information and certain valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates determined may not be indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
while viad intends to continue to meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 if hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if forecasted transactions did not occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
viad does not believe it is exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in its hedging activities as the counterparties are generally well established  well capitalized financial institutions 
stock based compensation 
as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  viad uses the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no

restructuring charges and other items 
as a component of the restructuring charge of million  an accrued liability related to facility closure and lease termination costs of million  net of estimated sublease income of million  was recorded as of december  these costs were accounted for pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under eitf no 
 these costs were considered to have no future economic benefit  and were therefore recorded at the time that viad management approved and committed to the restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of the recorded amounts were based on the contractual obligations contained in the leases net of estimated sublease income and estimates of incremental costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
under sfas no 
 a liability for the costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
the liability would subsequently be adjusted for revisions related to the timing and amount of estimated cash flows and accretion expense  if applicable 
if viad had elected to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 the majority of the million charge related to facility closure and lease termination costs would have been recorded based on the fair value of the liability at the time viad ceased using the related leased facilities and determined using a present value technique 
the remaining portion of the million liability would have been recorded at fair value at the time the liability was incurred when services associated with the activity were received 
if viad had elected to apply the accounting method under sfas no 
 the aggregate charge of million discussed above would not have been recorded in the fourth quarter of  rather  the fair value of these liabilities  estimated to be million  would have been initially recorded in based on the restructuring plan 
furthermore  accretion expense associated with the lease termination liability would likely be recognized in future periods over the remaining term of the related lease agreements 

table of contents the application of sfas no 
would not have changed the method of accounting for other components of the restructuring charge including severance and other benefits of million  asset impairments of million and other charges of  recent accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred eitf no 
 which became effective for viad on january  under eitf no 
 reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred are characterized as revenue in the income statement 
upon adoption of eitf no 
 comparative financial statements for prior periods should be reclassified to comply with the current presentation 
viad has historically accounted for the reimbursement of out of pocket expenses incurred similar to eitf no 
and  therefore  the adoption of eitf no 
did not impact viad s consolidated financial statements 
in january  viad adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no

 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
among other provisions  the new rules change the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale 
the standard also broadens the scope of businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as discontinued operations  and changes the timing of recognizing losses on such operations

this statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no

see critical accounting policies for discussion of restructuring charges 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation sets forth expanded disclosure requirements in the financial statements about a guarantor s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that  under certain circumstances  a guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation at the inception of the guarantee 
certain types of 
table of contents guarantees  such as product warranties  guarantees accounted for as derivatives  and guarantees related to parent subsidiary relationships are excluded from the liability recognition provisions of interpretation no 
 however  they are subject to the disclosure requirements 
the initial liability recognition provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of interpretation no 
are effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december  in accordance with interpretation no 
 viad has included the required disclosures relating to its guarantees in the financial statements as of december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
viad s guarantees principally relate to a parent s guarantee of a subsidiary s debt to a third party  and would therefore  be excluded from liability recognition at inception 
viad has not yet determined if the adoption of the new rules will have any material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
this statement also amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  viad has elected not to voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation at this time 
viad has included the additional disclosure requirements in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements

this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
interpretation no 
is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
the interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  viad has not yet determined if the adoption of interpretation no

forward looking statements as provided by the safe harbor provision under the private securities litigation reform act of  viad cautions readers that  in addition to the historical information contained herein  this annual report on form k includes certain information  assumptions and discussions that may constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are not historical facts  but reflect current estimates  projections  or expectations of or current trends in future growth  operating cash flows  availability of short term borrowings  consumer demand  new business  investment policies  productivity improvements  ongoing cost reduction efforts  efficiency  competitiveness  tax rates  restructuring plans including timing and realization of cost savings and market risk disclosures 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements 
viad s businesses can be affected by a host of risks and uncertainties 
among other things  gains and losses of customers  consumer demand patterns  labor relations  purchasing decisions related to customer demand for convention and event services  existing and new competition  industry alliances and consolidation and growth patterns within the industries in which viad competes and any further deterioration in the economy may individually or in combination impact future results 
in addition to the factors mentioned elsewhere  economic  competitive  governmental  technological  capital marketplace and other factors including further terrorist activities or war could affect the forward looking statements contained in this annual report 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk viad s market risk exposures relate to fluctuations in interest rates and  to a lesser degree  to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk is the risk that changing interest rates will adversely affect the market value and earnings of viad 
foreign exchange risk is the risk that fluctuating exchange rates will adversely affect earnings 
viad s exposure to these risks is primarily associated with its payment services business 
certain derivative financial instruments are used as part of viad s risk management strategy to manage these exposures 
derivatives are not used for speculative purposes 
viad has exposure to changing rates related to its pension assumptions including the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate 
viad is exposed to foreign exchange risk as it has certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
viad primarily utilizes forward contracts to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
forward contracts relating to payment services wire transfer transactions generally have maturities less than thirty days  and forward contracts relating to other receivables or payables generally have maturities less than ninety days 
the forward contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  and the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on the foreign denominated receivables and payables  net of the effect of the related forward contracts  is not significant 
a portion of viad s payment services business involves the payment of commissions to financial institution customers of its official check program described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a payment services subsidiary also has entered into agreements to sell receivables primarily from its money order agents 
the commissions and net proceeds from the agent receivables sales are computed based on short term variable interest rates that subject viad to risk arising from changes in such rates 
viad has hedged a substantial portion of the variable rate risk through swap agreements which convert the variable rate payments to fixed rates 
stockholders equity can be adversely affected by changing interest rates  as after tax changes in the fair value of securities classified as available for sale and in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are included as a component of stockholders equity 
the fair value of derivative financial instruments generally increases when the market value of fixed rate  long term debt investments decline and vice versa 
however  an increase or decrease in stockholders equity related to changes in the fair value of securities classified as available for sale  may not be offset  in whole or in part  by the decrease or increase in stockholders equity related to changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments 
viad is also exposed to short term interest rate risk on certain of its debt obligations 
viad currently does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows for such obligations 
earnings sensitivity to interest rate changes
