we also raised million through a follow on common stock offering  enabling us to pay off our entire outstanding debt balance 
a more detailed discussion of liquidity  capital resources and capital requirements follows 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided from operating activities provided the resources to support operations  including projected growth  seasonal working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
a summary of the company s working capital position and capitalization follows in thousands fiscal year ended february  february  february  net cash provided by operating activities    working capital  including current portion of long term debt of  at february     capitalization long term debt   shareholders equity    total capitalization    additional amounts available under the revolving portion of the credit facility    in connection with the spin off  the company entered into a million credit facility used to finance a million dividend to the limited as well as the repayment of a portion of working capital advances made by the limited prior to the spin off

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million for fiscal versus million for fiscal an increase in inventory levels  other long term assets and the timing of income tax payments more than offset the increase in net income plus depreciation and accrued expenses 
the increase in inventory levels was due to a combination of an increase in new stores early receipt of spring goods in january and  to a lesser extent  missed sales in late december and the month of january 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal an increase in net income plus depreciation and amortization  the timing of income taxes paid and a decreased investment in inventory were the primary causes for the increase in fiscal in fiscal  an increase in net income plus depreciation and amortization was more than offset by the timing of cash payments related to accounts payable and accrued expenses 
investing activities capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expended approximately million  million and million in connection with the construction of our new home office and distribution center in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the balance of capital expenditures in fiscal  and was incurred primarily to construct new stores and remodel existing stores 
in addition  investing activities included the company s purchase of corporate owned life insurance policies in connection with the company s nonqualified benefit plans 
we anticipate spending between million and million in fiscal for capital expenditures primarily for new stores  remodeling or expansion of existing stores and related fixtures and equipment 
we intend to add  to  square feet in  which will represent a to increase over year end we anticipate that the increase will result from opening approximately to new limited too stores and expanding approximately ten stores identified for remodeling 
additionally  we plan to open from to at least new mishmash stores during fiscal we estimate that the average cost for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures for limited too stores to be opened in will be between  and  per store  after giving effect to construction allowances 
average pre opening costs per store  which will be expensed as incurred  are expected to approximate  while inventory purchases are expected to average less than  per store 
we expect that substantially all capital expenditures in fiscal will be funded by cash on hand and net cash provided by operating activities 
financing activities financing activities in fiscal included stock option activity along with the issuance of restricted stock 
in addition  proceeds from the issuance of million shares of common stock in connection with a follow on offering consummated in may  and the corresponding repayment of the term loan  were also reflected 
financing activities in and principally consisted of the issuance of common shares related to restricted stock and stock options 
transitional services and separation agreements in connection with the august spin off  the company entered into several transitional services and separation agreements the transitional services agreements with the limited regarding certain aspects of our ongoing relationship 
we believe that the terms of these agreements are similar to terms achievable through arm s length negotiations with third parties 
a summary of some of the more significant transitional services agreements follows trademark and service mark licensing agreement we have entered into an exclusive trademark and service mark licensing agreement the trademark agreement with the limited that allows us to operate under the limited too brand name 
the agreement had an initial term of five years after the spin off  renewable annually at our option 
all licenses granted under the agreement will be granted free of charge 
in return  we are required to provide the limited with the right to inspect our stores and distribution facilities and an ability to review and approve our advertising 
under the trademark agreement  we are only able to use the brand name limited too in connection with any business in which we sell to our current target customer group or to infants and toddlers 
in addition  we may not use the limited too brand name or its derivative that competes with merchandise currently offered by the limited or its subsidiaries  unless it is for our current target customer group 
the limited has the right to terminate the trademark agreement under certain limited conditions 
services agreement the services agreement relates to transitional services that the limited or its subsidiaries or affiliates provided to us subsequent to the spin off 
under this agreement  the limited provided services in exchange for fees which we believe were similar in material respects to what a third party provider would charge  and were based on several billing methodologies 
under one of these billing methodologies  which was the most prevalent  the limited provided us with services at costs comparable to those charged to other businesses operated by the limited from time to time 
we were generally obligated to purchase those services at fees equal to the limited s costs of providing the services plus of these costs 
however  third party cost components were not subject to the mark on 
in fiscal and  the services that the limited provided to us principally related to merchandise distribution covering flow of goods from factory to store 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we began operating our own distribution center and cancelled the services agreement 
store leases agreement at february   of our stores were adjacent to the limited s stores 
in addition  many of these aforementioned stores are part of stores that are subject to sublease agreements the store leases agreement with the limited for stores where we occupy space that the limited leases from third party landlords the direct limited leases 
under the terms of the store leases agreement  we are responsible for our proportionate share  based on the size of our selling space  of all costs principally rent  excess rent  if applicable  maintenance and utilities 
all termination rights and other remedies under the direct limited leases will remain with the limited 
if the limited decides to terminate any of the direct limited leases early  the limited must first offer to assign such lease to us 
if  as a result of such early termination by the limited  we are forced to remodel our store or relocate within the mall  the limited will compensate us with a combination of cash payments and loans which will vary depending on the remaining term of the affected store lease at the time the limited closes its adjacent store as follows cash loan remaining lease term payment amount less than one year  one to two years   three to four years   greater than four years   approximately of the direct limited leases of which we are a part are scheduled to expire during or later 
we may not assign or sublet our interest in those premises  except to an affiliate  without the limited s consent 
if the limited intends to sublet or assign its portion of the leased premises under any of the direct limited leases to any non affiliate  it will be required to give us days notice  and we will be allowed to terminate our interest on that basis 
approximately of our direct leases are guaranteed by the limited 
pursuant to the store leases agreement  we are required to make additional payments to the limited as consideration for the guarantees that the limited provides under such leases along with amounts for adjacent stores based on those locations achieving certain performance targets 
contractual obligations the company s significant contractual obligations consist primarily of store leases 
as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has minimum rent commitments under store lease agreements of approximately million  excluding any additional payments covering other occupancy costs  such as maintenance and taxes 
credit facility in august  we entered into a five year  million collateralized credit facility 
the credit facility consisted of a million five year term loan and a million  five year annual revolving credit commitment 
the credit facility s interest rates  which reflect matrix pricing  are based on the london interbank offered rate or prime plus a spread as defined in the agreement 
the term loan was interest only until the end of the third year at which time the amortization of the outstanding principal balance would have begun 
the credit facility contains customary representations and warranties as well as certain affirmative  negative and financial covenants 
in november  the company amended the credit facility 
the amendment allows for the investment of cash in short term  aaa rated municipal bonds  as well as less stringent limitations on capital expenditures and on indebtedness incurred in relation to lease agreements 
on may   the company sold million shares of its common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
on that day  the company paid off the entire million term loan due under the credit facility  and the remaining proceeds from the sale of common stock will be used for general corporate purposes 
the million revolving loan commitment under the credit facility remains in effect and is available to the company for future business purposes 
at year end  the entire amount of the million revolving credit commitment was available to fund working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes 
impact of inflation our results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required  we believe that the effects of inflation  if any  on our results of operations and financial condition have been minor 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventories  long lived assets and sales returns 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from management s estimates 
management believes the following estimates and assumptions are most significant to reporting the company s results of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition retail sales are recorded when the customer takes possession of merchandise 
markdowns associated with the frequent buyer and too bucks programs are recognized upon redemption in conjunction with a qualifying purchase 
catalog and web sales are recorded upon shipment to the customer 
a reserve is provided for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a first in  first out basis  utilizing the retail method 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the use of the retail method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value and cost of inventories 
inherent in the retail method are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  initial merchandise markup  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
the company calculates inventory costs on an individual item class basis to ensure a high degree of accuracy in estimating the cost 
inventory valuation at the end of the first and third quarters reflects adjustments for inventory markdowns and shrinkage estimates for the total selling season 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
service lives are established for store assets ranging from to years for building improvements and to years for other property and equipment 
property and equipment at the home office and distribution center are assigned service lives between and years 
assets are reviewed on an annual basis for impairment  and based on management s judgment  are written down to the estimated fair value based on anticipated future cash flows 
income taxes income taxes are calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax laws and published guidance with respect to applicability to the company s operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes that it is more likely than not that the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
recently issued accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  will be effective in the first quarter of the standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes the corresponding estimated retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
because costs associated with exiting leased properties at the end of the lease terms are minimal  the company believes that when the statement is adopted  it will not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections was issued by the financial accounting standards board during the second quarter of sfas eliminates fasb statement no

sfas also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the provisions of this statement related to the rescission of statement shall be applied in fiscal years beginning after may  the provisions of this statement related to statement are effective for transactions occurring after may  all other provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued on or after may  the company believes that the adoption of the provisions of this statement related to the rescission of statement will not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
the adoption of the other provisions of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities was issued by the financial accounting standards board during the second quarter of sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas eliminates the definition and requirement for recognition of exit costs in eitf issue no 
where a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company believes that the adoption of this statement will not have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position 
financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others was issued in november fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under the guarantee 
guarantors will also be required to meet expanded disclosure obligations 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for annual and interim financial statements that end after december  the adoption of this interpretation will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issues raided in eitf  accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
this eitf issue addresses the timing of recognition for rebates that are earned by resellers based on specified levels of purchases or over specified periods of time 
this guidance related to timing of recognition is to be applied prospectively to new rebate arrangements entered into after november  this eitf issue also addresses the classification of cash consideration received from vendors in a reseller s income statement 
the guidance related to income statement classification is to be applied to all new arrangements or arrangements modified after december  the adoption of this issue did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas no
