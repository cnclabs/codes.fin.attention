item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of mack cali realty corporation and the notes thereto collectively  the financial statements 
certain defined terms used herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the financial statements 
critical accounting policies rental property rental properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
costs directly related to the acquisition  development and construction of rental properties are capitalized 
capitalized development and construction costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development and construction costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  salaries and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
interest capitalized by the company for the years ended december   and was million  and million  respectively 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred  major replacements and betterments  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
fully depreciated assets are removed from the accounts 
the company considers a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity as distinguished from activities such as routine maintenance and cleanup 
if portions of a rental project are substantially completed and occupied by tenants  or held available for occupancy  and other portions have not yet reached that stage  the substantially completed portions are accounted for as a separate project 
the company allocates costs incurred between the portions under construction and the portions substantially completed and held available for occupancy and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s rental properties may be impaired 
a property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
the company s estimates of aggregate future cash flows expected to be generated by each property are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates  and costs to operate each property 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions  the future cash flows estimated by management in their impairment analyses may not be achieved 
rental property held for sale when assets are identified by management as held for sale  the company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price  net of selling costs  of such assets 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the assets which have been identified for sale is less than the net book value of the assets  a valuation allowance is established 
if circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and  as a result  the company decides not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale  the property is reclassified as held and used 
a property that is reclassified is measured and recorded individually at the lower of a its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used  or b the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
see note to the financial statements 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
sfas no 
retains the requirements of sfas no 
regarding impairment loss recognition and measurement 
in addition  it requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
as the statement requires implementation on a prospective basis  properties which were identified as held for sale by the company prior to january  are presented in the accompanying financial statements in a manner consistent with the prior year s presentation 
as there were no additional properties identified as held for sale during the year ended december   the company did not report any discontinued operations for the periods presented 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence  but does not control these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the value of the investment 
see note to the financial statements 
deferred leasing costs costs incurred in connection with leases are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases and included in depreciation and amortization 
unamortized deferred leasing costs are charged to amortization expense upon early termination of the lease 
certain employees of the company provide leasing services to the properties and receive compensation based on space leased 
the portion of such compensation  which is capitalized and amortized  approximated million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
derivative instruments the company measures derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  at fair value and records them as an asset or liability  depending on the company s rights or obligations under the applicable derivative contract 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portions of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income oci and are subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging and ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings in the affected period 
see note to the financial statements interest rate contract

see note to the financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts management periodically performs a detailed review of amounts due from tenants to determine if accounts receivable balances are impaired based on factors affecting the collectibility of those balances 
management s estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to exercise significant judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of collection losses  which affects the allowance and net income

income before realized gains losses and unrealized losses on disposition of rental property and minority interests increased to million in from million in the increase of approximately million is due to the factors discussed above 
net income decreased by million  from million in to million in this decrease was a result of realized gains on disposition of rental property of million in and realized gains losses and unrealized losses on disposition of rental property  net  of million in this was partially offset by an increase in in income before realized gains losses and unrealized losses on dispositions of rental property and minority interests of million and a decrease in minority interests of million in liquidity and capital resources historically  rental revenue has been the principal source of funds to pay operating expenses  debt service and capital expenditures  excluding non recurring capital expenditures 
to the extent that the company s cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to finance its non recurring capital expenditures such as property acquisition and development and construction costs and other capital expenditures  the company has and expects to continue to finance such activities through borrowings under its revolving credit facility and other debt and equity financings 
the company believes that with the current downturn in the economy in general  and the softening of the company s markets specifically  it is reasonably likely that vacancy rates may continue to increase  effective rental rates on new and renewed leases may continue to decrease and tenant installation costs may continue to increase in most or all of its markets during as a result of the potential negative effects on the company s rental revenue from the overall reduced demand for office space  the company s cash flow may be insufficient to cover increased tenant installation costs over the short term 
if this situation were to occur  the company expects to finance any shortfall through borrowings under its revolving credit facility and other debt and equity financings 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through its working capital  net cash provided by operating activities and from its revolving credit facility 
the company frequently examines potential property acquisitions and development projects and  at any given time  one or more of such acquisitions or development projects may be under consideration 
accordingly  the ability to fund property acquisitions and development projects is a major part of the company s financing requirements 
the company expects to meet its financing requirements through funds generated from operating activities  proceeds from property sales  long term and short term borrowings including draws on the company s revolving credit facility and the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities

s p and fitch have also assigned their bbb rating to prospective preferred stock offerings of the company 
moody s investors service moody s has assigned its baa rating to the existing and prospective senior unsecured debt of the operating partnership and its ba rating to prospective preferred stock offerings of the company 
on september   the company obtained an unsecured revolving credit facility with a current borrowing capacity of million from a group of lenders  as described in note to the financial statements 
as of december   the company had outstanding borrowings of million under its unsecured revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the unsecured facility is currently libor plus basis points 
the company may instead elect an interest rate representing the higher of the lender s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
the unsecured facility also currently requires a basis point facility fee on the current borrowing capacity payable quarterly in arrears 
in the event of a change in the operating partnership s unsecured debt rating  the interest and facility fee rates will be adjusted in accordance with the following table operating partnership s unsecured debt ratings s p moody s fitch a interest rate applicable basis points above libor facility fee basis points no rating or less than bbb baa bbb bbb baa bbb bbb baa bbb current bbb baa bbb a a a or higher a if the operating partnership has debt ratings from two rating agencies  one of which is standard poor s rating services s p or moody s investors service moody s  the rates per the above table shall be based on the lower of such ratings 
if the operating partnership has debt ratings from three rating agencies  one of which is s p or moody s  the rates per the above table shall be based on the lower of the two highest ratings 
if the operating partnership has debt ratings from only one agency  it will be considered to have no rating or less than bbb baa bbb per the above table 
the unsecured facility matures in september  with an extension option of one year  which would require a payment of basis points of the then borrowing capacity of the credit line upon exercise 
the company believes that the unsecured facility is sufficient to meet its revolving credit facility needs 
the terms of the unsecured facility include certain restrictions and covenants which limit  among other things  the payment of dividends as discussed below  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  the incurrence of liens and the disposition of assets  and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum leverage ratio  the maximum amount of secured indebtedness  the minimum amount of tangible net worth  the minimum amount of debt service coverage  the minimum amount of fixed charge coverage  the maximum amount of unsecured indebtedness  the minimum amount of unencumbered property debt service coverage and certain investment limitations 
the dividend restriction referred to above provides that  except to enable the company to continue to qualify as a reit under the code  the company will not during any four consecutive fiscal quarters make distributions with respect to common stock or other equity interests in an aggregate amount in excess of percent of funds from operations as defined for such period  subject to certain other adjustments 
the terms of the company s senior unsecured notes  as defined in note to the financial statements which totaled approximately billion as of december   include certain restrictions and covenants which require compliance with financial ratios relating to the maximum amount of debt leverage  the maximum amount of secured indebtedness  the minimum amount of debt service coverage and the maximum amount of unsecured debt as a percent of unsecured assets 
as of december   the company had unencumbered properties  totaling million square feet  representing percent of the company s total portfolio on a square footage basis 
the debt of the company s unconsolidated joint ventures aggregating million are non recourse to the company except for i customary exceptions pertaining to such matters as intentional misuse of funds  environmental conditions and material misrepresentations and ii approximately million of debt on the harborside south pier joint venture with hyatt corporation hyatt

the company has a total of million of senior unsecured notes and mortgage debt scheduled to mature through march the company does not intend to reserve funds to retire the company s senior unsecured notes or its mortgages and loans payable upon maturity 
instead  the company will seek to refinance such debt at maturity or retire such debt through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities on or before the applicable maturity dates 
if it cannot timely raise such proceeds  the company may draw on its revolving credit facility to retire the maturing indebtedness  which would reduce the future availability of funds under such facility 
the company is reviewing various refinancing options  including the issuance of additional  or exchange of current  unsecured debt  preferred stock  and or obtaining additional mortgage debt  some or all of which may be completed during the company anticipates that its available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities  together with cash available from borrowings and other sources  will be adequate to meet the company s capital and liquidity needs both in the short and long term 
however  if these sources of funds are insufficient or unavailable  the company s ability to make the expected distributions discussed below may be adversely affected

the aforementioned restrictions do not apply in the event that the company sells all of its properties or in connection with a sale transaction which the company s board of directors determines is reasonably necessary to satisfy a material monetary default on any unsecured debt  judgment or liability of the company or to cure any material monetary default on any mortgage secured by a property 
the property lock ups expire periodically through upon the expiration of the property lock ups  the company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any sale  transfer or other disposition of the subject properties from resulting in the recognition of built in gain to the appropriate mack group  robert martin group or cali group members 
to maintain its qualification as a reit  the company must make annual distributions to its stockholders of at least percent of its reit taxable income  determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains 
moreover  the company intends to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to its stockholders which  based upon current policy  in the aggregate would equal approximately million on an annualized basis 
however  any such distribution  whether for federal income tax purposes or otherwise  would only be paid out of available cash after meeting both operating requirements and scheduled debt service on the company s debt 
funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo  after adjustment for straight lining of rents and non recurring charges  one measure of reit performance 
ffo is defined as net income loss before minority interest of unitholders  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring  other extraordinary items  and sales of depreciable rental property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
however  the company s ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the current definition of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  with the exception that it deviates as a result of adjustments made to the company s ffo for straight lining of rents and non recurring charges 
the company adjusts its ffo calculation to remove the effects of straight lining of rents because it believes that such adjustment more accurately reflects proper recognition of the company s revenue that is contractually due for the respective periods presented 
the company also adjusts its ffo calculation for non recurring charges because it believes that the inclusion of these costs  which are incurred specific to significant non recurring events  can impact the comparative measurement of the company s performance 
ffo for the years ended december   and  as calculated in accordance with nareit s definition as published in october  after adjustment for straight lining of rents and non recurring charges  are summarized in the following table in thousands year ended december  net income    add minority interest in operating partnership   deduct add realized gains losses and unrealized losses on disposition of rental property  net  add real estate related depreciation and amortization  gain on sale of land  non recurring charges  deduct rental income adjustment for straight lining of rents equity in earnings from gain on sale of rental property funds from operations  after adjustment for straight lining of rents and non recurring charges    deduct distributions to preferred unitholders   funds from operations  after adjustment for straight lining of rents and non recurring charges  after distributions to preferred unitholders cash flows provided by operating activities   cash flows used in provided by investing activities  cash flows used in financing activities   basic weighted average shares units outstanding   diluted weighted average shares units outstanding   includes the company s share from unconsolidated joint ventures of   and  for the years ended december   and includes the company s share from unconsolidated joint ventures of  and for the years ended december   and see calculations for the amounts presented in the following reconciliation
