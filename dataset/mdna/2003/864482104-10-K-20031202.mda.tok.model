item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  which should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
since our operating partnership and service company account for substantially all of our assets  revenues and earnings  a separate discussion of results of operations from our other subsidiaries is not presented 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of relating to our future business expectations and predictions and financial condition and results of operations 
some of these statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as prospects  outlook  believes  estimates  intends  may  will  should  anticipates  expects or plans or the negative or other variation of these or similar words  or by discussion of trends and conditions  strategies or risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed or implied in such cautionary statements 
the risks and uncertainties and their impact on our operations include  but are not limited to  the following risks o the impact of weather conditions on the demand for propane  o fluctuations in the unit cost of propane  o our ability to compete with other suppliers of propane and other energy sources  o the impact on propane prices and supply from the political and economic instability of the oil producing nations and other general economic conditions  o our ability to retain customers  o the impact of energy efficiency and technology advances on the demand for propane  o the ability of management to continue to control expenses  o the impact of regulatory developments on our business  o the impact of legal proceedings on our business  o our ability to implement our expansion strategy into new business lines and sectors  o our ability to integrate acquired businesses successfully 
on different occasions  we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements in other filings that we make with the sec  in press releases or in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking or cautionary statements  which reflect management s opinions only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking or cautionary statement 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this annual report and in future sec reports 
the following are factors that regularly affect our operating results and financial condition product costs the level of profitability in the retail propane business is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and product cost 
the unit cost of propane is subject to volatile changes as a result of product supply or other market conditions  including  but not limited to  economic and political factors impacting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing 
propane unit cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
there is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product cost increases fully or immediately  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
therefore  average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year to year as product costs fluctuate with propane  crude oil and natural gas commodity market conditions 
seasonality the retail propane distribution business is seasonal because of propane s primary use for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of our retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season from october through march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in our first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the winter heating season 
lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september our third and fourth fiscal quarters are expected 
to the extent necessary  we will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to unitholders in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
weather weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for propane for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many of our customers rely heavily on propane as a heating fuel 
accordingly  the volume of propane sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas  which can vary substantially from year to year 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane use  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater propane use 
risk management product supply contracts are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal and generally permit suppliers to charge posted market prices plus transportation costs at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery points 
since rapid increases in the cost of propane may not be immediately passed on to retail customers  such increases could reduce profit margins 
we engage in risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs and to help ensure the availability of propane during periods of short supply 
we are currently a party to propane futures contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange and enter into forward and option agreements with third parties to purchase and sell propane at fixed prices in the future 
risk management activities are monitored by management through enforcement of our commodity trading policy and reported to our audit committee 
risk management transactions may not always result in increased product margins 
see additional discussion in item a of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results 
estimates are used when accounting for depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  employee benefit plans  self insurance and legal reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  asset valuation assessment and valuation of derivative instruments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known to us 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note  summary of significant accounting policies  included within the notes to consolidated financial statements section elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe that the following are our critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of propane at the time product is delivered to the customer 
revenue from the sale of appliances and equipment is recognized at the time of sale or when installation is complete  as applicable 
revenue from repair and maintenance activities is recognized upon completion of the service 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts using a specific reserve for known or anticipated uncollectible accounts  as well as a general reserve for potential future uncollectible accounts taking into consideration our historical write offs 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we estimate the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate to estimate the present value of future benefit obligations and the cost of future health care benefits in determining our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in market conditions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
see pension plan assets below for additional disclosure regarding pension and other postretirement benefits 
self insurance reserves 
our accrued insurance reserves represent the estimated costs of known and anticipated or unasserted claims under our general and product  workers compensation and automobile insurance policies 
accrued insurance provisions for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents are based on an analysis of historical claims data 
for each claim  we record a self insurance provision up to the estimated amount of the probable claim or the amount of the deductible  whichever is lower  utilizing actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual historical claims data 
goodwill impairment assessment 
we assess the carrying value of goodwill at a reporting unit level  at least annually  based on an estimate of the fair value of the respective reporting unit 
fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using either i a market value approach taking into consideration the quoted market price of our common units  or ii discounted cash flow analyses taking into consideration estimated cash flows in a ten year projection period and a terminal value calculation at the end of the projection period 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see item a of this annual report for additional information about accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues increased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues from retail propane activities increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
this increase was the result of an increase in average propane selling prices  coupled with an increase in retail gallons sold 
propane selling prices averaged higher in fiscal compared to the prior year as a result of steadily increasing costs of propane throughout the first half of fiscal which remained higher during the second half of the year 
retail gallons sold increased million gallons  or  to million gallons in fiscal compared to million gallons in fiscal due primarily to colder average temperatures experienced in parts of our service area  particularly during the six month peak heating season from october through march temperatures nationwide  as reported by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa  averaged colder than normal in fiscal compared to warmer than normal temperatures in the prior year  or colder conditions year over year 
the coldest weather conditions  however  were experienced in the eastern and central regions of the united states 
in the west  average temperatures were warmer than normal during fiscal  compared to warmer than normal during the prior year 
in addition  our volumes continue to be affected by the impact of a continued economic recession on customer buying habits 
revenues from wholesale and risk management activities of million in fiscal decreased million  or  compared to revenues of million in the prior year primarily as a result of lower volumes sold in the wholesale market in line with our strategy to reduce our emphasis on wholesale activities 
revenue from other sources  including sales of appliances and related parts and services  of million in fiscal decreased million  or  compared to other revenue in the prior year of million 
the decrease in other revenues was primarily attributable to lower revenues from service and installations 
cost of products sold 
the cost of products sold reported in the consolidated statements of operations represents the weighted average unit cost of propane sold  including transportation costs to deliver product from our supply points to storage or to our customer service centers 
cost of products sold also includes the cost of appliances and related parts sold or installed by our customer service centers computed on a basis that approximates the average cost of the products 
cost of products sold is reported exclusive of any depreciation and amortization as such amounts are reported separately within the consolidated statements of operations 
cost of products sold increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the increase results primarily from a million impact from the aforementioned increase in the commodity price of propane resulting in a increase in the average unit cost of propane in fiscal compared to the prior year  coupled with the aforementioned increase in retail volumes sold resulting in an increase of million  offset by a million decrease from the decline in wholesale and risk management activities described above 
in fiscal  cost of products sold represented of revenues compared to in the prior year 
the increase in the cost of products sold as a percentage of revenues relates primarily to steadily increasing costs of propane during the first half of fiscal which remained higher during the second half of fiscal compared to steadily declining product costs in the prior year 
operating expenses 
all costs of operating our retail propane distribution and appliance sales and service operations are reported within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
these operating expenses include the compensation and benefits of field and direct operating support personnel  costs of operating and maintaining our vehicle fleet  overhead and other costs of our purchasing  training and safety departments and other direct and indirect costs of our customer service centers 
operating expenses increased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal operating expenses in fiscal include a million unrealized non cash loss representing the net change in fair values of derivative instruments  compared to a million unrealized non cash gain in the prior year see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information on our policies regarding the accounting for derivative instruments 
in addition to the million non cash impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments year over year  operating expenses increased million primarily resulting from i million increased pension costs  ii million higher insurance costs  iii million higher costs to operate our fleet primarily from increased fuel costs and iv million higher employee compensation and benefits to support the increased sales volume 
in addition  we experienced million higher bad debt expense as a result of the significant increase in the commodity price of propane resulting in higher prices to our customers  higher sales volumes and general economic conditions 
general and administrative expenses 
all costs of our back office support functions  including compensation and benefits for executives and other support functions  as well as other costs and expenses to maintain finance and accounting  treasury  legal  human resources  corporate development and the information systems functions are reported within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
general and administrative expenses of million for fiscal were million  or  higher than fiscal expenses of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the impact of million higher employee compensation and benefit related costs  as well as million higher fees for professional services in the current year period 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  compared to in fiscal gain on sale of storage facility 
on january  the second quarter of fiscal  we sold our million gallon propane storage facility in hattiesburg  mississippi  which was considered a non strategic asset  for net cash proceeds of million  resulting in a gain on sale of approximately million 
income before interest expense and income taxes and ebitda 
income before interest expense and income taxes decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda amounted to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year  a decline of million  or 
the decline in income before interest expense and income taxes and in ebitda over the prior year reflects the impact of higher retail volumes sold  offset by the million unfavorable impact of mark to market activity on derivative instruments year over year included within operating expenses  the million gain on sale of our hattiesburg  mississippi storage facility impacting prior year results and the higher combined operating and general and administrative expenses described above in support of higher business activity 
additionally  the million gain reported from the sale of nine customer service centers during fiscal  reported within discontinued operations  had a favorable impact on fiscal ebitda 
ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our management uses ebitda as a measure of liquidity and we are including it because we believe that it provides our investors and industry analysts with additional information to evaluate our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to pay our quarterly distributions to holders of our common units 
moreover  our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement require us to use ebitda as a component in calculating our leverage and interest coverage ratios 
ebitda is not a recognized term under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap 
because ebitda as determined by us excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  it may not be comparable to ebitda or similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the following table sets forth i our calculation of ebitda and ii a reconciliation of ebitda  as so calculated  to our net cash provided by operating activities amounts in thousands year ended september  september  net income   add provision for income taxes interest expense  net   depreciation and amortization   ebitda   add subtract provision for income taxes interest expense  net   gain on disposal of property  plant and equipment  net gain on sale of customer service centers  gain on sale of storage facility  changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities   net cash provided by used in operating activities   investing activities   financing activities   interest expense 
net interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense reflects the positive steps taken by us during the third quarter of fiscal to lower our overall leverage  which resulted in an million reduction in debt  coupled with lower average interest rates on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement during the first and second quarters of fiscal discontinued operations 
as part of our overall business strategy  we continually monitor and evaluate our existing operations to identify opportunities that will allow us to optimize our return on assets employed by selectively consolidating or divesting operations in slower growing or non strategic markets 
in line with that strategy  we sold nine customer service centers during fiscal for total cash proceeds of approximately million 
we recorded a gain on sale of approximately million  which has been accounted for within discontinued operations pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues of million in fiscal decreased million  or  compared to million in fiscal revenues from retail propane activities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease is principally due to a decrease in average selling prices  coupled with a decrease in retail gallons sold 
average selling prices declined as a result of a significant decline in the commodity price of propane in fiscal compared to the prior year 
retail gallons sold decreased  or million gallons  to million gallons in fiscal compared to million gallons in fiscal the decrease in volume was attributable to record warm weather conditions which were most dramatic during the peak heating months of october through march of fiscal as well as  to a lesser extent  the impact of the economic recession on commercial and industrial customers buying habits 
nationwide temperatures during fiscal were warmer than normal as compared to temperatures that were colder than normal during fiscal  as reported by noaa 
during the peak heating months of october through march  temperatures nationwide were warmer than normal as compared to colder than normal in the comparable period in fiscal  as reported by noaa 
volumes from the components of our customer mix that are less weather sensitive declined approximately year over year 
revenues from wholesale and risk management activities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal a less volatile commodity price environment for propane during fiscal compared to fiscal resulted in reduced risk management activities and lower volumes in the wholesale market 
revenue from other sources  including sales of appliances and related parts and services  of million in fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal revenues of million 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease results primarily from a million impact from the aforementioned decrease in the commodity price of propane resulting in a decrease in the average unit cost of propane during fiscal compared to fiscal this is coupled with the aforementioned decrease in retail volumes sold resulting in a decrease of million  and a million decrease from the decline in wholesale and risk management activities described above 
in fiscal  cost of products sold represented of revenues compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in the cost of products sold as a percentage of revenues relates primarily to steadily decreasing costs of propane during fiscal operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal operating expenses for the year ended september  include a million unrealized non cash gain representing the net change in fair values of derivative instruments not designated as hedges  compared to a million unrealized loss in fiscal see item a of this annual report for information on our policies regarding the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in addition to the million favorable impact from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments year over year  operating expenses decreased million  or  principally attributable to our ability to reduce costs amidst declining volumes resulting from ongoing initiatives to shift costs from fixed to variable  primarily in the areas of employee compensation and benefits 
the lower compensation costs of million were offset  in part  by a million increase in medical and dental costs in fiscal compared to the prior year 
additionally  operating expenses were favorably impacted by a million decrease in provisions for doubtful accounts and million lower costs of operating our fleet  including maintenance and fuel costs  in fiscal compared to fiscal provisions for doubtful accounts were higher in fiscal primarily as a result of the generally higher selling price environment driven by the higher average propane costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  again attributable to a decrease in employee compensation and benefit costs of million  as well as to a million decrease in fees for professional services  partly offset by a million increase in telecommunication costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year primarily as a result of our decision to early adopt sfas effective september  the beginning of fiscal  which eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill and certain intangible assets 
if sfas had been in effect at the beginning of the prior year  fiscal net income would have improved by million 
gain on sale of storage facility 
on january   we sold our million gallon propane storage facility in hattiesburg  mississippi  which was considered a non strategic asset  for net cash proceeds of million  resulting in a gain on sale of approximately million 
income before interest expense and income taxes and ebitda 
income before interest expense and income taxes decreased  or million  to million compared to million in the prior year 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda decreased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the decreases in income before interest expense and income taxes and in ebitda reflect the impact of the lower retail volumes sold in fiscal attributable to unseasonably warm heating season temperatures and the economy  partially offset by i the million  or  decrease in combined operating and general and administrative expenses described above  ii the impact of the million gain on the sale of our hattiesburg  mississippi storage facility and iii the impact on operating expenses of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments described above 
in addition  if sfas had been in effect at the beginning of the prior year  fiscal income before interest expense and income taxes would have improved by million 
ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our management uses ebitda as a measure of liquidity and we are including it because we believe that it provides our investors and industry analysts with additional information to evaluate our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to pay our quarterly distributions to holders of our common units 
moreover  our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement require us to use ebitda as a component in calculating our leverage and interest coverage ratios 
ebitda is not a recognized term under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap 
because ebitda as determined by us excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  it may not be comparable to ebitda or similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the following table sets forth i our calculation of ebitda and ii a reconciliation of ebitda  as so calculated  to our net cash provided by operating activities amounts in thousands year ended september  september  net income   add provision for income taxes interest expense  net   depreciation and amortization   ebitda   add subtract provision for income taxes interest expense  net   gain on disposal of property  plant and equipment  net  gain on sale of storage facility  changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities   net cash provided by used in operating activities   investing activities   financing activities   interest income and interest expense 
net interest expense decreased  or million  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to reductions in average amounts outstanding during fiscal under our revolving credit agreement  as well as lower average interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources due to the seasonal nature of the propane business  cash flows from operating activities are greater during the winter and spring seasons  our second and third fiscal quarters  as customers pay for propane purchased during the heating season 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to lower net income  including lower non cash items principally depreciation  amortization and gains on asset disposals  as well as the impact of increased investment in accounts receivable and inventories resulting from higher commodity prices and increased business activity during fiscal compared to fiscal due to generally colder average temperatures 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower net income  including lower non cash items principally depreciation  amortization and gains on asset disposals  as well as the impact of unfavorable changes in working capital in comparison to the prior year  principally reflecting lower compensation and benefit accruals  offset by lower inventories 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  reflecting million in capital expenditures including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of assets including net proceeds of million from the sale of nine customer service centers 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  reflecting million in capital expenditures including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of assets including net proceeds of million resulting from the sale of our propane storage facility in hattiesburg  mississippi 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  reflecting million in capital expenditures including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations  offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million  reflecting i the payment of our quarterly distributions to our common unitholders and our general partner amounting to million  ii the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit agreement amounting to million  iii the repayment of the second annual principal payment of million due under the senior note agreement  and iv the payment of million in fees associated with the renewal and extension of our revolving credit agreement during may the million reduction in debt during fiscal was funded through a combination of cash provided by operations and the net proceeds of million from a follow on public offering of approximately million common units including full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option which was completed during the third quarter of fiscal net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million  primarily reflecting the payment of quarterly distributions to our common unitholders and our general partner 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million  reflecting repayments under our operating partnership s revolving credit agreement  as amended and restated effective january  the revolving credit agreement  including a net repayment of million borrowed under the scana acquisition facility and a net repayment of million borrowed under the net working capital facility  and million for payment of quarterly distributions to our common unitholders and our general partner  partly offset by net proceeds of million from a public offering of approximately million common units in october on march   pursuant to a senior note agreement the senior note agreement  we issued million of senior notes the senior notes with an annual interest rate of 
our obligations under the senior note agreement are unsecured and rank on an equal and ratable basis with our obligations under the senior note agreement and the revolving credit agreement discussed below 
under the terms of the senior note agreement  we became obligated to pay the principal on the senior notes in equal annual payments of million starting july   with the last such payment due june  on july   we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of senior notes due june  the senior notes and used the funds to pay the first annual principal payment of million due under the senior note agreement 
our obligations under the agreement governing the senior notes the senior note agreement are unsecured and rank on an equal and ratable basis with our obligations under the senior note agreement and the revolving credit agreement 
rather than refinance the second annual principal payment of million due under the senior note agreement  we elected to repay this principal payment on june  our previous revolving credit agreement  which provided a million working capital facility and a million acquisition facility  was scheduled to mature on may  on may   we completed the second amended and restated credit agreement the revolving credit agreement which extends the previous revolving credit agreement until may  the revolving credit agreement provides a million working capital facility and an acquisition facility of million 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rate based upon either libor plus a margin  wachovia national bank s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus of 
an annual fee ranging from to  based upon certain financial tests  is payable quarterly whether or not borrowings occur 
these terms are substantially the same as the terms under the previous revolving credit agreement 
in connection with the completion of the revolving credit agreement  we repaid million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
on june   we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of million under the revolving credit agreement 
as of september  there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 
as of september   million was outstanding under the acquisition facility of the previous revolving credit agreement and there were no borrowings under the working capital facility 
the senior note agreement  the senior note agreement and the revolving credit agreement contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to our operating partnership  including a maintenance of certain financial tests  including  but not limited to  a leverage ratio of less than to and an interest coverage ratio in excess of to using ebitda in such ratio calculations  b restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  and c restrictions on certain liens  investments  guarantees  loans  advances  payments  mergers  consolidations  distributions  sales of assets and other transactions 
during december  we amended the senior note agreement to i eliminate an adjusted net worth financial test to be consistent with the senior note agreement and revolving credit agreement  and ii require a leverage ratio of less than to when the underfunded portion of our pension obligations is used in the computation of the ratio 
we were in compliance with all covenants and terms of all of our debt agreements as of september  and at the end of each fiscal quarter for all periods presented 
we will make distributions in an amount equal to all of our available cash  as defined in the second amended and restated partnership agreement  approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates 
the board of supervisors reviews the level of available cash on a quarterly basis based upon information provided by management 
during each of the first three quarters of fiscal  we paid distributions to our common unitholders of per common unit 
on july   the board of supervisors declared a annualized increase in the quarterly distribution from per common unit to per common unit  or on an annualized basis  for the third quarter of fiscal  which was paid on august  on october   the board of supervisors declared a quarterly distribution of per common unit for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was paid on november  to holders of record on november  quarterly distributions include incentive distribution rights idrs payable to the general partner to the extent the quarterly distribution exceeds per common unit 
the idrs represent an incentive for the general partner which is owned by our management to increase the distributions to common unitholders in excess of the per common unit 
with regard to the first of the common unit distribution  of the available cash is distributed to the common unitholders and is distributed to the general partner and  respectively  prior to our june public offering 
with regard to the balance of the common unit distributions paid  of the available cash is distributed to the common unitholders and is distributed to the general partner 
as discussed above  the results of operations for the fiscal year ended september  were impacted by generally colder average temperatures compared to fiscal across much of the united states  a challenging commodity price and supply environment and the sustained economic recession 
our results of operations were favorably impacted by a return to more normal weather patterns  particularly in the east  and our continued focus on managing our cost structure  despite the negative effects of unseasonably warm weather in the west and the economy 
in addition  our product supply and risk management activities helped to ensure adequate supply and to mitigate the impact of propane price volatility during a period of uncertainty surrounding the situation in iraq and other oil producing nations 
we took several steps during fiscal to further strengthen our balance sheet and improve our leverage  highlighted by the successful completion during the third quarter of a follow on public offering of approximately million common units and the repayment of million of debt 
the lower debt levels resulted in approximately million lower interest expense in fiscal compared to the prior year 
our anticipated cash requirements for fiscal include maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately million for the repair and replacement of property  plant and equipment  approximately million of interest payments on the senior notes  the senior notes and the revolving credit agreement and a principal payment of million due on june  under the senior note agreement 
in addition  assuming distributions remain at the current level  we will be required to pay approximately million in distributions to common unitholders and the general partner during fiscal based on our current estimate of our cash position  availability under the revolving credit agreement unused borrowing capacity under the working capital facility of million at september  and expected cash flow from operating activities  we expect to have sufficient funds to meet our current and future obligations 
in connection with the pending acquisition of the assets and operations of agway energy  we expect to close the acquisition upon completion of the auction process  final approval of the acquisition by the bankruptcy court and necessary regulatory approvals 
at present  we plan to fund the million purchase price and related acquisition costs and expenses with capital markets financings 
in the interim  we have obtained a commitment from established investment banking institutions to provide a million day facility to fund all or a portion of the purchase price 
if we draw on this facility  it would bear interest at a floating rate and  at our option  may be converted at maturity into a year term loan 
if the facility were drawn  we would seek to arrange for other permanent financing to repay the facility at our earliest opportunity  possibly through one or more offerings of equity or debt securities 
following consummation of the acquisition  we believe that we will have sufficient cash flow from operating activities and availability under our revolving credit agreement to fund the incremental cash requirements and to fund incremental working capital needs of the agway energy business for the forseeable future 
pension plan assets while our pension asset portfolio experienced significantly improved asset returns in fiscal  the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan continues to be impacted by the low interest rate environment affecting the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligations  as well as the cumulative impact of prior losses particularly during and as a result  the projected benefit obligation as of september  exceeded the market value of pension plan assets by million  which improved million compared to the million underfunded position at the end of the prior year 
the improvement in the funded status compared to fiscal has also resulted in a favorable adjustment of million to accumulated other comprehensive loss income  a component of partners capital  at the end of fiscal therefore  the cumulative reduction to partners capital amounted to million on the consolidated balance sheet at september  compared to the cumulative reduction of million as of september  the cumulative reduction to partners capital is attributable to the level of unrealized losses experienced on our pension assets over the past three years and represent non cash charges to our partners capital with no impact on the results of operations for the fiscal year ended september  our defined benefit pension plan was frozen to new participants effective january  and  in furtherance of our effort to minimize future increases in the benefit obligations  effective january  all future service credits were eliminated 
for purposes of computing the actuarial valuation of projected benefit obligations  we reduced the discount rate assumption from as of september  to as of september  to reflect an estimate of current market expectations related to long term interest rates 
additionally  we reduced the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption from as of september  to as of september  based on the current investment mix of our pension asset portfolio and historical asset performance 
there were no minimum funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plan during fiscal  or however  in an effort to proactively address our funded status we elected to make a voluntary contribution of million to our defined benefit pension plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal  thus improving our funded status

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  expands the existing disclosure requirements for guarantees and requires recognition of a liability for the fair value of guarantees issued after december  we have residual value guarantees associated with certain of our operating leases  related primarily to transportation equipment  with remaining lease periods scheduled to expire periodically through fiscal upon completion of the lease period  we guarantee that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed the guaranteed amount  or we will pay the lessor the difference 
although the fair value of equipment at the end of its lease term has historically exceeded the guaranteed amounts  the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments we could be required to make under these leasing arrangements  assuming the equipment is deemed worthless at the end of the lease term  is approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of september   we were a party to propane forward and option contracts with various third parties and futures traded on the new york mercantile exchange the nymex 
futures and forward contracts require that we sell or acquire propane at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
an option contract allows  but does not require  its holder to buy or sell propane at a specified price during a specified time period  the writer of an option contract must fulfill the obligation of the option contract  should the holder choose to exercise the option 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of propane to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then current price of propane and the fixed contract price 
the contracts are entered into in anticipation of market movements and to manage and hedge exposure to fluctuating propane prices  as well as to help ensure the availability of propane during periods of high demand 
market risks associated with the trading of futures  options and forward contracts are monitored daily for compliance with our trading policy which includes volume limits for open positions 
open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices 
market risk we are subject to commodity price risk to the extent that propane market prices deviate from fixed contract settlement amounts 
futures traded with brokers on the nymex require daily cash settlements in margin accounts 
forward and option contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term either by physical delivery or through a net settlement mechanism 
credit risk futures are guaranteed by the nymex and  as a result  have minimal credit risk 
we are subject to credit risk with forward and option contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform 
we evaluate the financial condition of each counterparty with which we conduct business and establish credit limits to reduce exposure to credit risk of non performance 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we account for derivative instruments in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 sfas no 
and sfas no 
all derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet  within other current assets or other current liabilities  at their fair values 
on the date that futures  forward and option contracts are entered into  we make a determination as to whether the derivative instrument qualifies for designation as a hedge 
prior to march   we determined that our derivative instruments did not qualify as hedges and  as such  the changes in fair values were recorded in income 
beginning with contracts entered into subsequent to march   a portion of the derivative instruments entered into have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we formally assess  both at the hedge contract s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss income oci to the extent effective and reclassified into cost of products sold during the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings 
the mark to market gains or losses on ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in cost of products sold immediately 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges are recorded in current period earnings 
fair values for forward contracts and futures are derived from quoted market prices for similar instruments traded on the nymex 
at september   the fair value of derivative instruments described above resulted in derivative assets of million included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and derivative liabilities of million included within other current liabilities 
for the year ended september  operating expenses include unrealized non cash losses of million compared to unrealized non cash gains of million for the year ended september   attributable to the change in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges 
at september   unrealized gains on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in the amount of million were included in oci and are expected to be recognized in earnings during the next months as the hedged transactions occur 
however  due to the volatility of the commodities market  the corresponding value in oci is subject to change prior to its impact on earnings 
sensitivity analysis in an effort to estimate our exposure to unfavorable market price changes in propane related to our open positions under derivative instruments  we developed a model that incorporates the following data and assumptions a 
the actual fixed contract price of open positions as of september  for each of the future periods 
b 
the estimated future market prices for futures and forward contracts as of september  as derived from the nymex for traded propane futures for each of the future periods 
c 
the market prices determined in b 
above were adjusted adversely by a hypothetical change in the future periods and compared to the fixed contract settlement amounts in a 
above to project the potential negative impact on earnings that would be recognized for the respective scenario 
based on the sensitivity analysis described above  the hypothetical adverse change in market prices for each of the future months for which a future  forward and or option contract exists indicate either a reduction in potential future gains or potential losses in future earnings of million and million  as of september  and september   respectively 
the above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario 
actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio 
as of september   our open position portfolio reflected a net long position purchase aggregating million 
the average posted price of propane on november  at mont belvieu  texas a major storage point was cents per gallon as compared to cents per gallon on september   representing a increase
