item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are revenue recognition  and excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when an order has been received  pricing is fixed  product has been shipped and collectibility is reasonably assured 
title to goods passes to customers upon shipment  there are no customer acceptance provisions included in sales contracts and the company has no installation obligation subsequent to product shipment 
similarly  revenue is recognized upon shipment to distributors as title passes to them without additional involvement or obligation 
collection of receivables related to distributor sales is not contingent upon subsequent sales to third parties 
cost of sales includes the cost of the product and the company s estimate of any additional warranty  rework or other concessions the company expects to incur in connection with a sale 
government sales are fixed price contracts 
the company has not experienced losses in the past on such contracts 
should the company identify a loss on a future contract  the company would account for the loss under statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and record a charge against earnings in the period the estimated loss was identified 
the company accrues minimum royalties due from customers over the related royalty period 
royalties earned in excess of minimum royalties due are recognized as reported by the licensees 
the company enters into license agreements and receives nonrefundable license fees in exchange for the use of technology previously developed by the company 
the licensee receives the right to manufacture and sell certain products exclusively within specified geographic areas 
the nonrefundable license fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income on a straight line basis over the exclusivity period of the agreement 
a termination or change to the initial license agreement could result in an accelerated recognition of the deferred revenue 
license fees are included in royalty revenue 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
the company s financial statements include an estimate associated with reserves with respect to inventory 
various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of this estimate 
the process of determining this estimate is fact specific and takes into account primarily historical experience and expected economic conditions 
the company evaluates this estimate on a monthly basis and makes adjustments each quarter where facts and circumstances dictate 
the company reserves  or  of that inventory considered to be obsolete and  or  of that inventory considered to be slow moving 
the company evaluates all inventory which has not had activity for twelve months 
as of march   the company s inventory reserve was  or approximately of total inventory 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as described therein  the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements
