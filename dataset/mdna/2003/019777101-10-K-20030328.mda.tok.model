item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have devoted substantially all of our resources to date to the clinical development of rsr we completed enrollment in our pivotal phase clinical trial of rsr in patients with brain metastases during the third quarter of  and we expect to perform a preliminary analysis of the results during the second quarter if the phase trial is positive  we intend to file an nda with the fda to seek marketing approval for rsr for the treatment of patients who are receiving radiation therapy for brain metastases 
if the phase trial is negative or inconclusive  we may delay our filing 
we may also choose to perform another phase trial on brain metastases  continue our phase trial on nsclc or discontinue our development of rsr and focus our development efforts on other compounds 
in either event  we expect to re evaluate our development plans and cash expenditures once we know the results of our phase trial 
until we decide whether to submit an nda to the fda to seek approval of rsr  likely during the second quarter of  we expect our operating expenses to moderately increase during the first half of we intend to continue with certain clinical trials  pre commercial scale up in clinical manufacturing  and pre marketing activities related to the planned commercialization of rsr however  if we decide to submit an nda for rsr  we expect to incur rising cash expenditures associated with developing a commercial organization  pre launch marketing activities and executing the future development plans for our drug candidates 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the calendar year however  our ability to execute our development and commercialization plan for rsr and our other drug candidates will require substantial capital beyond in order to fund our capital needs beyond  we intend to seek capital through arrangements with corporate partners  equity or debt financings  or from other sources  including the proceeds of product sales  if any 
if we are not able to raise sufficient additional funds  we expect to re evaluate our level of activity and cash expenditures associated with the planned development and commercialization of rsr and our other drug candidates 
we have not derived any commercial revenues from product sales  and we do not expect to receive product revenues until at least there can be no assurance if or when we will become profitable 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue to incur increasing research and clinical development costs  in addition to costs related to manufacturing and commercialization activities 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
our ability to achieve profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to successfully complete the development of our product candidates  and obtain required regulatory clearances and successfully manufacture and market our future products 
critical accounting policies our results of operations and financial position are determined based on the application of our accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to the financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we have not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies 
we also have not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are important to fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results presented in the financial statements and require management to make judgments and estimates that are inherently uncertain 
we record the costs of clinical studies  clinical development  finished drug inventory  regulatory affairs  biostatistical data analysis  non clinical studies  basic research and licensing fees as a component to research and development expenses 
clinical study costs represent internal costs for personnel  external costs incurred at clinical sites and contracted payments to third party clinical research organizations to perform certain clinical trials 
we are obligated to make certain upfront payments upon execution of certain research and development agreements 
we record these upfront payments as prepaid research and development expenses 
such payments are expensed as services are performed or terms of the respective agreements are achieved 
we accrue research and development expenses for activity occurring during the fiscal year prior to receiving invoices from clinical sites and third party clinical research organizations 
we accrue external costs for clinical studies based on the progress of the clinical trials  including patient enrollment  dosing levels of patients enrolled  estimated costs to dose patients  and contracted costs with clinical research organizations and clinical sites 
we record internal costs primarily related to personnel in clinical development  regulatory affairs and biostatistical data analysis and external costs related to non clinical studies and basic research when incurred 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual costs incurred may or may not match the estimated costs for a given accounting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions 
we record the costs of upfront fees and milestone payments for our licensing agreements as a research and development expense as payments are made under the agreements 
our finished drug inventory is expensed to research and development since we are still a development stage company and we have not received regulatory approval to market rsr after regulatory approval  we will be required to capitalize any future costs of our marketed products at the lower of cost or market 
the timing of future payments for finished drug inventory in relation to the timing of regulatory approval may cause variability in our future cost of goods sold and clinical manufacturing expenses 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and research and development 
research and development expenses include the costs of clinical trials  clinical development  data analysis  non clinical studies  basic research and licensing fees for a new product candidate 
research and development expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
excluding the impact of non cash charges comprising amortization of deferred compensation and stock expense see non cash charges below  research and development expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the million increase in was due primarily to increased headcount to support our clinical trials and to develop a regulatory department  and paying an initial up front license fee related to the in licensing of the pdx compound 
the million increase in research and development spending in was due primarily to increased enrollment costs for our phase trial of rsr for brain metastasis and additional headcount required to support this trial 
we expect research and development expenses will continue to increase in  due primarily to external costs associated with our planned phase clinical trial of rsr for non small cell lung cancer 
we plan to enroll approximately patients in this trial over an estimated year period 
we expect this clinical trial to cost million and take years from commencement of the trial to completion 
the extent and timing of the increased costs related to this clinical trial will be significantly influenced by the rate at which we enroll study participants 
we expect our internal research and development costs to increase moderately in to support the expansion of our clinical development programs  including initiating several additional phase clinical trials of rsr  the further development of pdx and bgp and the continued development of our product pipeline through in licensing of additional compounds 
if we decide to delay the filing of an nda with the fda because the results of our phase trial of rsr in patients with brain metastasis are not sufficient or we are not able to raise sufficient additional funds  our research and development costs may decrease in the future if we have to curtail our development plans for rsr or any of our other compounds 
clinical manufacturing 
clinical manufacturing expenses include third party manufacturing costs for rsr for use in clinical trials  costs associated with pre commercial scale up of manufacturing to support anticipated commercial requirements  and development activities for clinical trial material for pdx and bgp clinical manufacturing expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the  increase in resulted from increased headcount and consulting expenses to support our anticipated nda filing and pre manufacturing costs for bgp the  decrease in primarily resulted from decreased consulting and pre manufacturing product formulation expenses 
we expect clinical manufacturing expenses to increase significantly in as we have entered into two purchase orders with third party manufacturers to purchase approximately million of bulk drug to meet our anticipated commercial requirements for rsr and develop clinical trial material for pdx and bgp if we decide to terminate these purchase orders because our phase trial results are negative or inconclusive  or because rsr does not receive regulatory approval when anticipated  we could incur termination fees of up to million 
the timing of future payments for finished drug inventory in relation to the timing of regulatory approval may cause variability in our future cost of goods sold and clinical manufacturing expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include costs for executive administration  corporate offices and related infrastructure  corporate development and pre marketing activities 
general and administrative expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
excluding the impact of non cash charges comprising amortization of deferred compensation and stock compensation expense see non cash charges below  general and administrative expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the million increase in and the million increase in were both primarily due to additional costs associated with being a public company  personnel costs related to our administrative infrastructure and corporate development  and facility costs 
if the results of our phase trial on rsr are positive  we expect these costs to continue to increase as personnel are hired to begin developing a commercial organization and pre launch marketing activities 
if the results of our phase trial are negative or inconclusive and we decide to forego or delay the filing of our nda with the fda  or if we are not able to raise sufficient additional funds  our general and administrative costs will likely decrease as we will be required to reduce our administrative infrastructure to conserve our capital resources 
interest and other income  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the million decrease in primarily resulted from lower average investment balances and lower yields on us government securities  high grade commercial paper and corporate notes and money market funds 
the  increase in was attributable to increased average investment balances from the proceeds of our initial public offering and higher yields available on our investment funds 
income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset future regular and alternative taxable income 
these carryforwards will expire beginning in the utilization of the loss carryforwards to reduce future income taxes will depend on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards 
in addition  the availability of the net operating loss carryforwards to reduce us federal taxable income is subject to various limitations in the event of an ownership change in our stock 
non cash charges 
we have recorded stock based compensation expense resulting primarily from certain options granted prior to our initial public offering with exercise prices below the fair market value of our common stock on their respective grant dates 
in  we recorded million in general and administrative  negative million in research and development and  in clinical manufacturing 
the negative balance recorded in research and development is the result of recovery of an expense of million that was recorded in prior periods due to the cancellation of a former employee s unvested options 
in  we recorded million in general and administrative  million in research and development and  in clinical manufacturing 
in  we recorded million in general and administrative  million in research and development and  in clinical manufacturing 
at december   we had million of deferred compensation remaining to be expensed in future years 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of common and preferred stock and a public equity financing  which have resulted in net proceeds to us of million through december  we have used million of cash for operating activities 
cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term marketable securities were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
working capital was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash used in operating activities was primarily to fund net losses  excluding non cash charges 
net cash provided by investing activities for and was million and million  respectively  and consisted primarily of proceeds from the maturities of short term investments  partially offset by the purchase of short term investments  acquisition of property and equipment and the investment in equity of another company in net cash used in investing activities during was million and consisted primarily of net purchases of investments and acquisition of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities during was million and resulted from the private sale of common stock to a single investor  exercise of common stock options  and the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash used in financing activities during was  and consisted primarily of pledging collateral for a line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities during was million and consisted primarily of proceeds from our initial public offering 
we have no other material external sources of liquidity 
because we have not derived any commercial revenues from product sales and a significant amount of our capital resources are held in the form of short term financial instruments  decreasing yields on instruments such as united states government securities  high grade commercial paper and corporate notes and money market funds would reduce net cash provided by investing activities  which is our primary source of liquidity in the absence of additional capital raised through additional equity or debt financing 
during  we signed two purchase orders to purchase approximately million of commercial grade bulk drug material to be delivered in if we receive fda approval for rsr  our expenditures to secure commercial grade bulk drug material will increase substantially 
if the results of our phase trial for rsr do not meet certain criteria  we may cancel one of the purchase orders totaling million for the commercial grade bulk drug resulting in aggregate termination fees of up to million 
we may cancel the other purchase order totaling million for commercial grade bulk drug  without penalty  if the results of our phase trial for rsr do not meet certain criteria 
below is a schedule of contractual commitments as of december  related to our operating leases and other long term obligations 
less than year years years more than years total operating leases     other long term obligations    total contractual cash obligations   other long term obligations includes the potential termination fees for the purchase orders for commercial grade bulk drug material  termination fees for contracts with clinical research organizations and future milestone payments under our in licensing commitments which could be paid earlier depending on the timing of achieving the respective milestone 
based upon the current status of our product development and commercialization plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the calendar year we anticipate continuing our current development programs and beginning other long term development programs on new products and technologies 
these projects will require many years and substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful 
we will require significant levels of additional capital beyond from outside sources to continue research and development activities  fund operating expenses  pursue regulatory approvals and build commercial sales and marketing capabilities  as necessary 
our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the results of our phase clinical trial in brain metastases  status of product development  the time and cost involved in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to market and distribute our future products and establish new collaborative and licensing arrangements 
we intend to raise additional capital in the future through arrangements with corporate partners  equity or debt financings or from other sources  including product sales  if any 
such arrangements may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
in addition  if additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners or other sources  such arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or products under development that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any such arrangements 
in the event we are not able to raise sufficient additional funds  we may be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate one or more of our product development programs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures on market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations 
all of these market risk sensitive instruments are classified as held to maturity 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio contains instruments that are subject to the risk of a decline in interest rates 
we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  liquid debt securities that limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
we prepared sensitivity analyses of our interest rate exposures and our exposure from anticipated investment for fiscal to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based on the results of these analyses  a adverse change in interest rates from the fiscal year end rates would not have a material adverse effect on the fair value of investments and would not materially impact our results of operations  cash flows  or financial condition for the next months
