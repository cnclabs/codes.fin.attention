other significant factors the company s pretax loss in included net periodic pension expense of million as compared to net periodic pension income of million in the increase in net periodic pension expense is due primarily to a decrease in the market value of pension plan assets  a reduction of the expected return on plan assets assumption for and the amortization of actuarial losses 
additionally at dec 
  the majority of the company s defined benefit pension plans had an accumulated benefit obligation abo in excess of plan assets 
as a result  the company recorded an additional minimum pension liability adjustment in this adjustment reduced the prepaid pension asset by million  increased the intangible pension asset by million and the minimum pension liability by million and reflected a deferred tax benefit of million with a resulting reduction in shareholders equity through an increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss of million

in connection with the resolution of these matters  the company surrendered in july certain company owned life insurance policies and received proceeds of million  which are included in reductions of other property and investments in the investing activities section in the statement of cash flows under item of this form k 
the effective tax rate for is expected to approximate 
the decrease in short term debt during is due principally to the repayment of various us and us debt obligations 
outlook during  we continued to experience mixed economic signals in the united states 
although we saw strong consumer spending and housing starts  we also saw increased unemployment and low demand in the commercial construction sector 
additionally  increases in industrial production  which trended up for much of the year  fell back in the fourth quarter 
business investment declined in for the second straight year 
economic results in also reflect the positive influence of the extension of sales incentive programs by the north american automobile manufacturers which were on and off throughout  offsetting weaker european automotive markets 
as we begin the new year  the economic reports indicate that the growth in the us economy appears to have stalled in the fourth quarter of factory orders and industrial production in the us declined in december  the us dollar weakened against the euro and our trade deficit grew 
this news creates further uncertainty concerning the outlook for our economy in the consensus view calls for modest growth in consumer spending and a gradual rise in business investment that would lead to moderate growth in the us economy in the second half of the year 
the outlook for the global economy generally lags behind that of the us  with some exceptions such as china 
that outlook is clouded by uncertainties such as the threat of terrorism or war with iraq 
despite the challenges of weaker economic conditions in and  we were able to take several important steps to strengthen our company as a result of our commitment to financial discipline 
first  we elevated our focus on cash flow and were able to pay down over million in debt in and over million in second  as a result of the workforce reductions and other restructuring actions undertaken in and and our continued focus on cost reductions and improvements to business processes  we reduced our manufacturing and overhead costs by million in in  we will continue to focus on reducing costs and improving productivity 
we will also continue our efforts to improve our customers results through the delivery of cost effective solutions 
these efforts will include developing new products and integrated product service offerings to meet our customers needs 
while the steps taken above will translate into improved profitability  costs for employee benefits continue to grow 
we expect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs to increase by about million in  which will reduce earnings per share by about 
this is due to the decline in the market value of the company s pension plan assets  due primarily to negative investment returns in the us equity market during the last three years  a reduction in our expected rate of return on plan assets assumption to approximately for  rising medical costs  particularly for prescription drugs and a lower discount rate assumption 
despite the expected increase in these costs  we do not believe that we will have a mandatory funding requirement under pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc or internal revenue service irs regulations in the near term  so there will only be a minor impact on cash flows in as a result of these factors 
another potential risk in will be increases in energy and raw material costs  particularly for natural gas and petroleum based materials 
the factors driving these costs upward have historically created favorable market conditions for pricing in our chlor alkali business 
during  we benefited from lower raw material costs  primarily associated with our coatings businesses  as well as from lower natural gas costs 
however  in the fourth quarter we began to see this benefit diminish and our natural gas costs in the fourth quarter of exceeded those for the same period of the prior year 
changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the operating performance of our chemicals and glass segments 
each one dollar change in the price of natural gas per mmbtu million british thermal units could have a direct impact of 
table of contents annual report and form k ppg industries  inc 
management s discussion and analysis approximately million on our annual operating costs 
it has become increasingly more difficult to predict future natural gas prices  which are expected to continue to be volatile over the next few years 
in order to reduce the risks associated with volatile prices  we use a number of techniques  which include hedging  reducing consumption through improved manufacturing processes and switching to alternative fuels 
as of dec 
  we hedged approximately one third of our anticipated natural gas requirements for at an average price of per mmbtu 
we also expect the continuing consolidation of companies within our customer and competitor groups  excess global automotive production capacity and the availability of imported products from low labor cost markets to lead to continued downward pressure on our selling prices 
for  we expect slow and perhaps erratic expansion in our north american markets and gains in our asian markets 
we expect continued softness in our european and south american markets 
there are several developments that would signal a more solid economic environment for  the most important of which would be steady growth in industrial production 
we expect that will be another challenging year due to the combination of worldwide political and economic uncertainties  but we are confident that the steps we have taken put us on solid footing to reap the benefits of improved market conditions  both in the us and abroad  whenever they occur

during and  we paid million and million  respectively  related to restructuring reserves accrued in and see note  acquisitions and business restructuring  under item of this form k for an expanded description of these restructuring actions 
commitments and contingent liabilities  including environmental matters ppg is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims  both actual and potential  including some that it has asserted against others  in which substantial monetary damages are sought 
see note  commitments and contingent liabilities  under item of this form k for an expanded description of certain of these lawsuits  including the proposed settlement of asbestos claims announced on may  as discussed in note  although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable  management believes that  in the aggregate  the outcome of all lawsuits and claims involving ppg  including asbestos related claims in the event the settlement described in note does not become effective  will not have a material effect on ppg s consolidated financial position or liquidity  however  such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs  if any  are recognized 
it is ppg s policy to accrue expenses for environmental contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
reserves for environmental contingencies are exclusive of claims against third parties and are generally not discounted 
as of dec 
 and  ppg had reserves for environmental contingencies totaling million and million  respectively 
pretax charges against income for environmental remediation costs in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively  and are included in other charges in the statement of income under item of this form k 
cash outlays related to such environmental remediation aggregated million  million and million in  and  respectively 
management anticipates that the resolution of the company s environmental contingencies will occur over an extended period of time 
over the past years the pretax charges against income have ranged between million and million per year 
we anticipate that charges against income in will be within that range 
it is possible  however  that technological  regulatory and enforcement developments  the results of environmental studies and other factors could alter this expectation 
in management s opinion  the company operates in an environmentally sound manner and the outcome of the company s environmental contingencies will not have a material effect on ppg s financial position or liquidity 
in addition to the amounts currently reserved  the company may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be as much as million to million  which range is unchanged from the prior year end 
such unreserved losses are reasonably possible but are not currently considered to be probable of occurrence 
the company s environmental contingencies are expected to be resolved over an extended period of time 
although the unreserved exposure to future loss relates to all sites  a significant portion of such exposure involves three operating plant sites in our chemicals segment 
initial remedial actions are occurring at these sites 
studies to determine the nature of the contamination are reaching completion and the need for additional remedial actions  if any  is presently being evaluated 
the loss contingencies related to the remaining portion of such unreserved exposure include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination  if any  at these other sites and the methods that may have to be employed should remediation be required 
the most significant of these sites is the calcasieu river estuary  near our lake charles  la 
chemicals plant 
the us environmental protection agency usepa has been investigating contamination levels in the calcasieu river estuary 
during  the usepa issued draft human health and ecological risk assessments indicating that elevated levels of risk exist in the estuary 
it is expected that usepa could issue final risk assessments in followed by a remedial investigation report 
ppg would then have discussions with the usepa and other parties to determine what  if any  role ppg would have in addressing estuary issues

annual report and form k management s discussion and analysis with respect to certain waste sites  the financial condition of any other potentially responsible parties also contributes to the uncertainty of estimating ppg s final costs 
although contributors of waste to sites involving other potentially responsible parties may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability  in general  final allocations of costs are made based on the relative contributions of wastes to such sites 
ppg is generally not a major contributor to such sites 
the impact of evolving programs  such as natural resource damage claims  industrial site reuse initiatives and state voluntary remediation programs  also adds to the present uncertainties with regard to the ultimate resolution of this unreserved exposure to future loss 
the company s assessment of the potential impact of these environmental contingencies is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the complex  ongoing and evolving process of investigation and remediation  if necessary  of such environmental contingencies 
impact of inflation ppg s financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
in  the decline in selling prices and the negative effects of inflation on our production costs were not fully recovered through improved manufacturing efficiencies across all of our businesses and lower raw material and natural gas costs 
in  the increase in production costs due to the negative effects of inflation was not fully recovered through price increases and manufacturing efficiencies  which were adversely impacted by lower production volumes 
in  the negative effects of inflation  including the impact of higher natural gas costs  were substantially offset in the aggregate by the impact of higher selling prices in our glass and chemicals businesses and manufacturing efficiencies in all of our businesses 
while inflationary and market pressures on costs are expected to be experienced in  we anticipate that ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies  improvement in sales volume as well as increases in selling prices for certain products will more than offset the negative effect of inflation on operating income

as of dec 
  million shares of common stock had been repurchased under this program at a cost of million

in addition to the lines of credit  the company may issue up to million aggregate principal amount of debt securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec in july critical accounting policies management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements and related notes under item of this form k and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements relate to accounting for contingencies  under which we accrue a loss when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated  and to accounting for pensions  other postretirement benefits  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives because of the importance of management judgment in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies 
contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
the most important contingencies impacting our financial statements are those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable  environmental remediation  pending litigation against the company and the resolution of matters related to open tax years 
for more information on these matters  see note  working capital detail  note  income taxes and note  commitments and contingent liabilities under item of this form k 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
in determining the expected return on plan asset assumption  the company evaluates long term actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of long term investment returns 
in selecting rates for current and long term health care assumptions  the company takes into consideration a number of factors including the company s actual health care cost increases  the design of the company s benefit programs  the demographics of the company s active and retiree populations and expectations of inflation rates out into the future 
see note  pensions and other postretirement benefits  under item of this form k for information on these plans 
as discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  under item of this form k  the company tests goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of such assets to their carrying values 
fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies that are based on projections of the amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows 
as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving ppg managers with functional responsibility for financial  credit  environmental  legal  tax and benefit matters and outside advisors such as consultants  engineers  lawyers and actuaries 
the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base their judgments on these contingencies and to develop the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the financial statements under item of this form k related to these contingencies  pensions  postretirement benefits  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are based on the best estimates and judgments of the appropriate ppg management  although actual outcomes could differ from our estimates

annual report and form k management s discussion and analysis currency the euro and the british pound sterling strengthened against the us dollar and  respectively  during the effects of translating the net assets and net earnings of our operations denominated in these currencies to the us dollar increased consolidated net assets by approximately million but did not have a significant impact on the results of operations 
this was offset  in part  by the continued devaluation of the argentine peso  which reduced our net investment in argentina by million to a total of million at dec 
 any reduction in the value of these net assets resulting from a further devaluation of the argentine peso will result in a direct charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity

you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports to the sec 
also  note the following cautionary statements 
many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s forward looking statements 
among these factors are increasing price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors  fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials  the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements  economic and political conditions in international markets  the ability to penetrate existing  developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets  which also depends on economic and political conditions  foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates  and the unpredictability of possible future litigation  including litigation that could result if the asbestos settlement does not become effective 
further  it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 
consequently  while the list of factors presented here is considered representative  no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties 
unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements 
the consequences of material differences in the results as compared to those anticipated in the forward looking statements could include  among other things  business disruption  operational problems  financial loss  legal liability to third parties and similar risks  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  operations or liquidity
