item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
overview we are a leading provider of critical research tools and integrated support services that enable innovative and efficient drug discovery and development 
we are the global leader in providing the animal research models required in research and development for new drugs  devices and therapies and have been in business for more than years 
we have two segments for financial reporting purposes biomedical products and services  and research models 
in  total net sales grew to million 
significantly higher sales yielded a gross margin of 
higher sales  operating efficiencies and the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  resulted in operating income of million  a increase over and a operating margin  compared to in our biomedical products and services business segment contributed significantly to our performance  achieving growth of in net sales for the year 
sales from our research models segment grew in for  net income before extraordinary item was million  a increase over  and diluted earnings per share eps before extraordinary item grew to 
the adoption of sfas no 
impacted eps by per diluted share in our products and services are currently marketed throughout the world 
our international revenues  which include revenues from our non us subsidiaries  represented of our total net sales in  in and in we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our biomedical products and services segment contributed of total net sales in one of the largest contributors to this segment s growth in was our transgenic services business  where we work alongside researchers using our technologies which enable them to develop new targets  pathways and  ultimately  drugs 
our new  square foot state of the art facility  located at our headquarters in wilmington  massachusetts  is rapidly filling to accommodate this segment s greater than revenue growth in another contributor to this segment s growth in was our acquisitions of biological laboratories europe limited biolabs and springborn laboratories inc springborn 
we acquired biolabs  our ireland based human and animal health testing company  in june  and springborn  our ohio based drug safety assessment business  in october during  our biomedical products and services segment was negatively impacted by several events  all of which occurred in our development services business unit 
in late  we evaluated two of our smaller  non strategic development businesses that had experienced lower net sales than expected 
both units  analytical chemistry and biopharmaceutical production  were part of primedica corporation  which we acquired in we consolidated the primedica analytical chemistry business with our existing business and determined to divest certain assets associated with our niche biopharmaceutical production business 
in total  these two businesses accounted for approximately of total net sales in our development business was also adversely affected by the performance of two of the smallest service areas which accounted for approximately of total net sales in  due to ineffective local management  moderating demand and uneven study execution 
we have since reorganized development services under a senior executive officer and are making structural changes at the local level 
we believe these changes will improve operating performance in our development services business by the end of our research models segment contributed of our total net sales in the gain in net sales for this business segment reflected increased customer demand for our animal research models and  in particular  higher sales of our specialty models  such as diabetic rats and immunodeficient mice  and in our standard outbred toxicology models 
this year was the first time in over a decade that worldwide research model sales increased at double digit levels 
in order to accommodate this growth  we added production space in three north america locations 
due to the high level of fixed costs in our research model segment  incremental sales in this segment are very profitable 
although we increased our infrastructure costs  the net sales increase drove a improvement in operating income and this business continued to generate strong cash flow 
based on conversations with some of our key customers  we believe there has been a recent trend for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology drug companies to focus much of their efforts on early compound screening and on the late stage discovery phase 
this trend towards increasing spending on early screening drove a demand for our research models in that was greater than at any time in the last decade 
we believe this trend will continue at least through the early screening of compounds has resulted in a large number of short term  acute toxicology studies  rather than the longer term  sub chronic and chronic studies that enhanced our services mix in the first three quarters of the trend towards increasing spending on late stage discovery led in part to less spending on our development services business in the fourth quarter of and we expect that it will continue to do so at least through the first three quarters of continued research and development spending by pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies and research institutions  and funding of research by government agencies  is critical to our continued success 
a substantial portion of our net sales in our research models segment is derived from customers at academic and research laboratories whose funding is partially dependent on funding from government sources  such as the us national institutes of health nih and similar domestic and international agencies 
we also derive revenue directly from government agencies 
continued growth in funding of research by these government agencies is important to our continued growth 
our customers also include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
our ability to continue to grow is also dependent upon the ability and willingness of these industries to continue to spend on research and development at rates close to or at historical levels and to outsource the products and services we provide 
while we believe that research and development spending will continue in at least consistent with the increases of the past two years  our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by these industries  academic institutions and government agencies 
we have two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes research models and biomedical products and services 
in addition  our consolidated statements of income also provide a breakdown of net sales between net sales related to products  which include both research models and biomedical products  and net sales related to services  which reflect biomedical services  and a breakdown of costs between cost of products sold and cost of services provided 
the following tables show the net sales and the percentage contribution of our reportable segments for the past three years 
they also show cost of products sold and services provided  selling  general and administrative expenses and operating income by segment and as percentages of their respective segment net sales

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a summary of those accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates include the following goodwill and other intangible assets revenue recognition pension plan accounting income taxes and deferred tax assets allowance for doubtful accounts goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of businesses we have acquired  we have material intangible assets  including goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinite lived acquired intangibles 
the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition  as well as the completion of annual impairment tests  require significant management judgments and estimates 
these estimates are made based on  among others  consultations with an accredited independent valuation consultant  reviews of projected future income and statutory regulations 
changes in business strategy and or market conditions may significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to the recorded asset balances 
we performed transitional and annual impairment tests in and concluded the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset balances were not impaired 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on product and services sales 
recognition of service revenue is primarily based on the completion of agreed upon performance criteria 
the recognition of service revenue requires management judgments primarily relating to the determination of the level of service procedures performed during the period 
as of december   we had recognized unbilled revenue of million and deferred revenue of million in the consolidated balance sheet based on the difference between the estimated level of services performed and the billing arrangements within our service contracts 
pension plan accounting 
we recognize pension plan assets  liabilities and expenses based on information provided by independent actuaries 
the actuaries use assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to employees and allocate this cost to the service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries 
the assumed discount rate  which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled  is adjusted based on the change in the long term treasury bond yield as of the measurement date 
as of december   the discount rate was lowered to from as of december  due to the lower yields compared to the prior year 
the estimated effect of a change in the discount rate is to increase pension expense by million in the assumed expected return on plan assets is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants 
if the actual return is different from the assumed expected return in plan assets  the difference would be amortized over a period of approximately to years 
during  we lowered our expected return on plan assets to from 
this is expected to increase the annual pension expense by approximately million in income taxes and deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
as part of the recapitalization transaction  we elected under internal revenue code section h to treat the transaction as a purchase resulting in a step up in the tax basis of the underlying assets 
the election resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset in in the amount of million for the estimated future tax benefits associated with the increased tax basis of the assets 
the balance of this deferred tax asset as of december  was million 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we recorded a valuation allowance of million on a total net deferred tax asset of million 
to the extent we increase this valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
a valuation allowance is currently set against deferred tax assets because management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
we also do not provide for taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as it is our intention to reinvest undistributed earnings indefinitely 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish allowances for doubtful accounts based on our review of credit profiles of our customers  contractual terms and conditions  current economic trends and payment history 
we reassess the allowances for doubtful accounts each period 
if we changed our judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  differences in the amount and timing of revenue or expense recognized could result 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales in were million  an increase of million  or  from million in on a pro forma basis  sales increased in pro forma sales include net sales of our acquisitions as if they had occurred at the beginning of fiscal biomedical products and services 
net sales of biomedical products and services in were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in  and represented of net sales 
the increase was due to continued growth in outsourcing in the pharmaceutical industry and our acquisitions 
the acquisitions of biolabs and springborn contributed million of sales in pro forma sales of biomedical products and services increased in compared to our discovery sales growth continued to be driven by transgenic services and contract staffing 
our vaccine support business sales increased during due to increased product sales and increased pricing and the consolidation of our mexican joint venture 
the consolidation of our mexican joint venture added million of sales in our development business sales increased due to additional safety assessment studies and biosafety testing  which was partially offset by reduced business at our contract biopharmaceutical production facility 
research models 
net sales of research models in were million  an increase of million  or  from million in net sales of research models represented of our net sales 
sales of our small animal research models in north america  which comprised of research models  increased due to an increase in unit volume and a shift to higher priced specialty units which accounted for  improved pricing of and the additional models from our acquisition of genetic models  inc gmi which accounted for 
excluding the positive impact from currency translation of million  sales of our small animal research models in europe  which comprised of research models  increased  driven in part by an increase in unit volume of  improved pricing of and a shift to higher priced specialty units which accounted for 
excluding the unfavorable impact from currency translation of million  sales of our small animal research models in japan  which comprised of research models  increased in the increase was primarily due to increased sales of unique specialty models  through our cooperative agreement with the jackson laboratory and market share gains due to competitor product quality issues 
sales from our large animal breeding and import conditioning business increased million in due to increased pricing and additional unit volume 
cost of products sold and services provided
