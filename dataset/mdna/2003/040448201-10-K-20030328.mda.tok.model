inventory levels increase in march through june in anticipation of the peak shipping season 
the majority of shipments are made between june and august and the majority of cash receipts are collected from august through october

inflation has had and is expected to have only a minor effect on the company s operating results and its sources of liquidity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for and significant accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of all the company s significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company believes the following accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenues customarily applying fob shipping point terms  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of products to its customer  which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers 
the point of shipment is typically from one of the distribution centers or  on occasion  a vendor s location as a drop shipment 
all drop shipment sales are recorded at gross selling price 
an allowance is provided for estimated future returns 
prepaid catalog costs and amortization the company accumulates all direct costs incurred in the development  production and circulation of catalogs on the consolidated balance sheet until the related catalog is mailed  at which time they are amortized into selling and administrative expense over the estimated sales realization cycle of one year  using the straight line method 
goodwill the company adopted sfas no 
 business combinations sfas as of july  sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
the company also adopted the provisions of sfas  effective january  under sfas  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
instead  sfas requires that goodwill be evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired  by applying a fair value based test and  if impairment occurs  the amount of impaired goodwill must be written off immediately 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment based on the expected future cash flows or earnings projections 
goodwill is deemed impaired if the discounted cash flows or earnings projections generated do not substantiate the carrying value 
the estimation of such amounts requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital  and selection of an appropriate discount rate  as applicable 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease discounted future operating cash flows or earnings projections and could  therefore  change impairment determination 
the company has evaluated its goodwill at january  and december   and determined that there has been no impairment of goodwill 
taxes at december   the balance sheet contains a net deferred tax asset of approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of approximately million  related primarily to federal net operating tax loss carryforwards 
the realizability of this asset is dependent upon the company s generation of approximately million in future taxable income and the ability to retain its federal net operating tax loss carryforward position 
as of december   the company had federal net operating tax loss carryforwards of approximately million 
based upon projected future operating results  federal net operating tax loss carryforwards of million are expected to be utilized to offset future federal taxable income through however  events may limit the use of all or a portion of these federal net operating tax loss carryforwards  thus potentially resulting in a higher tax liability for the company in the future 
the net deferred tax asset at december  is subject to future adjustment based upon changes in management s evaluation of the realizability of the deferred tax asset 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas requires the company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal use of the assets 
the company also records a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
the company is required to adopt sfas on january  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statement s 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
in addition  sfas establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s operating results 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  the application of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
the interpretation requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after january  if it is reasonably possible that the company will consolidate or disclose information about variable interest entities when the interpretation becomes effective

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as described below  credit risk and interest rate risk are the primary sources of market risk in the company s marketable securities and long term borrowings 
qualitative interest rate risk changes in interest rates can potentially impact the company s profitability and its ability to realize assets and satisfy liabilities 
interest rate risk is resident primarily in long term borrowings  which have variable interest rates based on libor rates 
assuming no other change in financial structure  an increase of in the variable interest rate for long term borrowings would decrease pre tax earnings by approximately 
million 
this amount is determined by considering a increase in interest on the average long term borrowings estimated to be outstanding in credit risk the company s marketable securities have been invested in investment grade corporate bond funds and closed end bond funds  both domestic and international  the securities in which have various maturities 
the company holds no other marketable securities as of december  the company provides credit in the normal course of business to its customers  which are either educational institutions or distributors who sell to educational institutions 
no single customer accounted for more than of sales in   or the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses and generally does not require collateral to support the accounts receivable balances 
quantitative the company s long term borrowings as of december  are as follows in millions  except percentage data maturity less than one year maturity greater than one year long term borrowings amount weighted average interest rate fair market value the fair market value of long term borrowings equals the face amount of long term borrowings outstanding because the underlying rate of interest is variable based upon libor rates
