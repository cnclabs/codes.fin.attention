table of contents outlook forward looking statements the statements contained in the letter from the ceo and the president  item business and in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not strictly historical fact  including without limitation  our statements relating to growth opportunities  the number of stores we believe will open and our belief that we will have adequate capital and reserves to meet our current and contingent obligations and operating needs are forward looking statements made under the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act 
such statements are based on management s current expectations as of the date of this report but involve risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements 
investors are cautioned to consider these forward looking statements in light of important factors which may result in variations from results contemplated by such forward looking statements including  but not limited to the risk factors discussed below 
risk factors dependence on renewals 
each of our franchise agreements is years long 
at the end of the term of each franchise agreement  each franchisee has the option to renew the franchise relationship by signing a new year franchise agreement 
in  of the franchisees that had their play it again sports franchise agreement expire  signed new year franchise agreements 
in  and   and play it again sports franchise agreements will expire  respectively 
we believe that renewing a significant number of these franchise relationships is extremely important to the success of the company 
if a significant number of such franchise relationships are not renewed  our financial performance may be materially and adversely affected 
two once upon a child franchise agreement expired in and franchise relationship was renewed by the franchisee signing a new year franchise agreement 
in  and   and once upon a child franchise agreements will expire  respectively 
we believe that renewing a significant number of these franchise relationships is extremely important to the continued success of the company 
decline in number of franchisees 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
in  play it again sports closed stores and opened stores  a net loss of stores 
it is very important to the future success of the company that the net loss of play it again sports stores be slowed and ultimately reversed 
we believe that a certain number of stores will close each year 
our objective is to minimize store closings by continuing our investment in franchisee support services such as franchisee training and the winmark computer support center  by investing capital to improve winmark s proprietary point of sale software system and continuing to train our field operations personnel to better serve franchisee needs 
we believe that many of the store closings referenced above were related to weaker stores 
dependence on new franchisees 
our ability to generate increased revenue and achieve higher levels of profitability depends on increasing the number of franchised stores open 
we believe that many larger and smaller markets will continue to provide significant opportunities for sales of franchises and that we can sustain approximately our current annual level of store openings 
however  there can be no assurance that we will sustain this level of store openings 
inability to collect accounts receivable 
in the event that our ability to collect accounts receivable significantly declines from current rates 
we may incur additional charges that affect earnings 

table of contents unopened stores 
we believe that a substantial majority of stores sold but not opened will open within the time period permitted by the applicable franchise agreement or we will be able to resell the territories for most of the terminated or expired franchises 
however  there can be no assurance that substantially all of the currently sold but unopened franchises will open and commence paying royalties to us 
dependence on supply of used merchandise 
our brands are based on offering customers a mix of used and new merchandise 
as a result  obtaining continuing supplies of high quality used merchandise is important to the success of our brands 
supply of used merchandise comes from the general public and is not regular or highly reliable 
there can be no assurance that we will avoid supply problems with respect to used merchandise 
lease terminations 
we have closed or sold a number of our company owned stores over the past several years  most of which were part of the it s about games chain of stores 
we have been negotiating lease terminations relative to the closed stores 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate satisfactory terminations of such remaining leases 
we remain contingently liable with respect to the leases relating to certain company stores sold 
there can be no assurance that such independent third parties will comply with the terms and conditions of such leases  in which case we will be responsible to make payments owed under such leases 
we believe that we have adequate reserves to cover any prospective liability with respect to such leases 
competition 
retailing  including the sale of sporting goods  children and teenage apparel  and musical instruments  is highly competitive 
many retailers have significantly greater financial and other resources than us and our franchisees 
individual franchisees face competition in their markets from retailers of new merchandise and  in certain instances  resale  thrift and other stores that sell used merchandise 
to date  our franchisees and our company owned stores have not faced a high degree of competition in the sale of used merchandise 
however  we may face additional competition as our franchise systems expand and if additional competitors enter the used merchandise market 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our ability to control the amount  and rate of growth in  selling  general and administrative expenses and the impact of unusual items resulting from our ongoing evaluation of our business strategies  asset valuations and organizational structures is important to our financial success 
we cannot assure any investor that we will be able to control such items of expense 
government regulation 
as a franchisor  we are subject to various federal and state franchise laws and regulations 
although we believe we are currently in material compliance with existing federal and state laws  there is a trend toward increasing government regulation of franchising 
the promulgation of new franchising laws and regulations could adversely affect us 
investment in tomsten  inc during   the company agreed to purchase million of the common stock of tomsten  inc d b a 
archiver s  a privately held corporation 
archiver s is a retail concept created to help people preserve and enjoy their photographs 
archiver s stores feature a wide variety of photo safe products  including photo albums  scrapbooks and scrapbook supplies  frames  rubber stamps  and photo storage and organization products 
there is not a market for the common stock of tomsten and our ability to realize a cash return on our investment will depend  in part  on i the development of a public market for tomsten or ii the sale of tomsten 
winmark s ownership stake does not represent a majority voting interest and we do not have the contractual ability to control the actions of tomsten s 
the loss of our entire investment would result in a loss of million and have a material impact on our financial performance 
we do not undertake and specifically decline any obligations to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company incurs financial markets risk in the form of interest rate risk 
management deals with such risk by negotiating fixed rate loan agreements 
accordingly  the company is not exposed to cash flow risks related to interest rate changes 
the company had no debt outstanding at december  a one percent change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the company s fixed rate debt 
approximately million of our investments at december  were invested in fixed income securities and million of cash and cash equivalents in money market mutual funds  which are subject to the effects of market fluctuations in interest rates 
a one percent change in interest rates may have a significant impact on the fair value of the fixed income securities
