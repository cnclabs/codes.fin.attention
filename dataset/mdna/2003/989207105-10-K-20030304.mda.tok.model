the company s investments in product development resulted in a stream of product introductions throughout this period 
the company also placed zebra sales representatives in international territories deemed to have growth potential  thereby allowing the company to work more closely with its channel partners in those regions 
in addition  the company organized its sales and marketing efforts to support a sales strategy that demonstrates the business benefits associated with implementing bar code labeling and specialty printing solutions 
management believes that these investments contributed to the company s sales growth in in north america  the company recorded positive sales growth in the second  third and fourth quarters of  compared with the corresponding periods of overall  however  the slow us economy continued to limit sales growth of bar code label and receipt printers to rates below the company s historical average 
sales of supplies  specifically ribbons  were affected by price pressure from increased international competition particularly from japan 
sales of supplies nevertheless benefited from an increase in unit sales 
management believes that the long term outlook for bar code label and receipt printing in north america remains favorable but is unable to determine at this time when growth might return to historical levels experienced before the downturn 
all three of the company s international regions europe  asia pacific  and latin america had record sales and contributed to the significant growth in international sales in the company s increase of the number of zebra representatives in these regions  including the formation of a sales team in europe for mobile printing solutions in  was an important factor in the growth of international sales 
on a dollar volume basis  the largest increase occurred in the company s european region 
the strength of the british pound and the euro versus the us dollar increased sales for the company s european region by approximately  compared with exchange rates that prevailed during it is difficult for management to accurately forecast the direction of foreign exchange movements  and therefore  to estimate the impact of foreign exchange rates on future financial results  either positive or negative 
management believes that international territories hold significant growth opportunities for the company and expects to continue to invest in personnel and infrastructure to support sales growth in these regions 
gross profit was  for  up from  for in addition  gross profit margin increased to from 
the major contributors to the margin improvement were higher capacity utilization related to the higher sales volume  product cost reductions  and the effect of foreign exchange movements 
management estimates that changes in foreign exchange rates increased gross profit by  in selling and marketing expenses increased to  or of net sales  from  or of net sales 
most of the change can be attributed to an increase in additional headcount and performance related payroll expenses  specifically commissions and bonuses related to the company s growth in net sales 
trade show  travel and consulting expenses were also higher compared with during  the company identified vertical markets that management believes offer growth opportunities for zebra s printing and connectivity technologies 
to this end  management expects that a higher level of selling and marketing infrastructure will be required to access these markets and achieve the company s growth objectives within them  compared with zebra s historical business model 
increased staffing occurred in marketing functions in to enable the company to access vertical markets 
management expects that selling and marketing expenses in future periods will reflect the higher costs related to generating business within vertical markets 
research and development expenses for were  up from  for  and represented of net sales in versus in printer products introduced over an month period that ended december  accounted for approximately of printer sales for  compared with for the comparable period ending december  higher project and personnel expenses were partially offset by lower expenditures for consulting services 
the company considers its ability to develop and introduce new products to be a significant competitive factor

in connection with the termination  the company recorded  in expenses for acquisition costs that would otherwise have been capitalized 
there was no such expense in the company incurred merger costs of  in and  in these costs related to the acquisition of comtec information systems in april management expects that future periods will have no further merger costs related to acquisitions completed prior to the date of this report 
in the event of future acquisitions  management expects to record merger costs related to those acquisitions  the amount of which cannot be determined at this time 
investment income was  for  an increase of from  for favorable investment income was a result of a  pre tax gain on the sale of  shares of common stock of fargo electronics  in addition to the absence of a  pre tax write down of a long term investment that occurred in the write down occurred because the decline in the asset s value was viewed as other than temporary 
this write down reduced diluted earnings by per share

s  specifically in the manufacturing and technology sectors 
a full year s sales of mobile printing systems as a result of the comtec acquisition  compared with only three quarters in  partially offset the decline from this weakness 
the decline in north american sales was a result of the slowdown in the us economy  which restricted sales of bar code label and receipt printers in north america 
this slowdown began in and became more severe in international sales for showed virtually no growth 
growth in the company s european region to a record level resulted from the formation of a team dedicated to the sale of mobile printing systems and sales expansion in eastern europe 
this growth was offset by sales declines in latin america and asia pacific

amortization of intangible assets totaled  compared with  for the increase was due to a full year s amortization of intangible assets related to the comtec acquisition  compared with three quarters in as part of the comtec acquisition  the company acquired printer and wireless technology 
a portion of the purchase price was attributed to acquired in process technology  as the development work associated with the projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and was believed to have no alternative future use 
the company assessed the fair value of the acquired in process technology using an income approach 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded a  charge to write off this acquired in process technology 
there was no such charge in the company incurred merger costs of  in and  in these costs related to the merger with eltron international  inc in october  which was accounted for as pooling of interests  and the comtec acquisition 
these costs exclude certain direct costs of the comtec acquisition  which were not included as a portion of the purchase price or recorded at the time of the transaction 
in  these costs primarily consisted of expenditures on information technology infrastructure to integrate the comtec and eltron operations 
investment income was  for  a decrease of from  for lower investment returns on invested balances contributed to the decline 
in addition  in the third quarter of  the company recorded a  pre tax write down of a long term investment  in which the decline in value was viewed as other than temporary 
this write down reduced diluted earnings by per share 
interest expense and other expense  net  for totaled  compared with  in the decline was primarily attributable to the effectiveness of currency hedging strategies to minimize the effects of foreign currency transactions  which the company implemented during the second half of in  losses from foreign currency transactions on the value of euro denominated cash deposits and receivables from customers and pound sterling denominated receivables from the company s uk subsidiary totaled  compared with  for income before income taxes decreased to  from  as a percentage of net sales  income before income taxes declined to from 
net income of  or per diluted share  for was down from  or per diluted share  for critical accounting policies and estimates management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra technologies corporation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements require certain estimates  judgments and assumptions  which are believed to be reasonable  based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the periods presented 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
management assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important to possibly trigger an impairment review consist of significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business significant negative industry or economic trends significant decline in zebra s stock price for a sustained period significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  management measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to  as of december  in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective 
as a result  the company ceased amortizing approximately  of goodwill  including existing intangible assets that were not considered identifiable under sfas no 
the company recorded approximately  of amortization on these amounts during and would have recorded approximately  of amortization during in lieu of amortization  the company was required to perform an initial impairment review of its goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the company completed its initial impairment review during the second quarter of considering the share price of the company s stock among other measures of fair value  this impairment test indicated that the fair value of the company s goodwill was significantly in excess of the carrying value 
consequently  no impairment charge was recorded 
revenue recognition zebra recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
certain customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
the company regularly monitors and tracks product returns and records a provision for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns 
while such returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse effect on operating results for the periods in which such returns materialize 
a increase decrease in returns above historical levels would decrease increase operating income by approximately 
accounts receivable the company has established standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts receivable 
these policies and procedures include credit reviews of all new customer accounts to establish credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  which may include customer financial statements  bank and trade references  credit rating agency information and other credit related information that becomes available 
additionally  the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of current customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of current credit information 
the company has established regional credit functions  reporting directly to the corporate financial officers  to manage the credit granting  review  and collections processes 
over the last three years  quarter end accounts receivable balances have ranged from to days sales outstanding 
as of december   accounts receivable before provisions for uncollectible accounts were  or days of sales 
similarly  past due accounts receivable are also at the low end of historical ranges as of december  the historically low balance  high quality  accounts receivable portfolio is the result of improvements to credit and collections policies  procedures  and staffing implemented during the company maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues 
over the last three years  accounts receivable reserves have been in the range of to of total accounts receivable 
accounts receivable reserves as of december  were  or of the balance due 
management feels this reserve level is appropriate given the relatively low accounts receivable balances combined with the quality of the portfolio as of december  while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  management cannot guarantee that the company will continue to experience credit loss consistent with historical experience 
zebra s accounts receivable portfolio is diversified among a large number of customers and geographic markets 
no individual customer exceeds of gross accounts receivable balances as of december   and only one customer exceeds of gross accounts receivable as of december  included in accounts receivable is an account with a  disputed balance 
although management believes this account is fully collectible  a  accrued liability has been recorded to cover the estimated cost of collection 
if the actual collection  net of costs  is less than  operating income would be reduced 
inventories the company values its inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture  or the current estimated market value 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 
a significant increase in the demand for zebra s products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may be understated or overstated 
in the future  if inventories are determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventories are determined to be undervalued  the company may have over reported cost of goods sold in prior periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand  however any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventories and reported operating results 
over the last three years  the company s reserves for excess and obsolete inventory have ranged from to of gross inventory 
as of december   reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were  or of gross inventory 
reserve for tax litigation and tax audits the company has recorded the estimated liability related to certain pending tax litigation and tax audits based on management s estimates of the probable range of loss 
as additional information becomes available  management will assess the potential liability related to pending litigation and tax audits  and revise estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of potential future liabilities could materially affect the results of operations and financial position 
the company is litigating a dispute over a tax assessment in the amount of approximately  including penalties and interest  with the illinois department of revenue for the years through the case was filed by the company in the district court of illinois and tried during november the decision from the court was unfavorable to the company but has been appealed 
the company does not expect to know the result of the appeal until some time in the second half of the illinois department of revenue has also examined the company s tax returns for the years and  and issued an assessment for  the issues involved in this audit are identical to those involved in the to returns being litigated 
the company has paid this assessment under protest 
management believes that the ultimate outcome of this assessment will be consistent with the to litigation under appeal 
in addition  the illinois department of revenue has not yet examined the company s income tax returns for through  but has a right to do so 
management believes that if such an audit occurred  the illinois department of revenue would raise issues similar to those raised during the through audits 
the company recorded tax reserves equal to management s estimate of the likely outcome of the illinois department of revenue litigation for to  the audit assessment for and  and the unaudited through returns 
if the company loses all issues on appeal  the company would record an additional one time tax expense of  if the company wins all issues on appeal  the company would record a reduction to tax expense of  for additional information respecting this matter  see note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements annexed to this report

examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
this standard will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  management does not believe the adoption of sfas no

risk factors investors should carefully consider the risks  uncertainties and other factors described below  as well as other disclosures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  because they could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  operating results  and growth prospects 
the company could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes  including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption 
acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results 
proposed acquisitions that are not consummated may result in the write off of certain acquisition costs 
the company may acquire or make investments in other businesses  technologies  services or products 
the process of integrating any acquired business  technology  service or product into operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention  which could otherwise be available for ongoing development of the business 
the expected benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
moreover  the company may be unable to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses 
to the extent that a proposed acquisition is not consummated  the company may be required to write off certain costs associated with the acquisition  which could be significant 
the company may not be able to continue to develop products to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by rapid technological change 
to be successful  zebra must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving its products as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands 
zebra s industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards frequent new product and service introductions evolving distribution channels changing customer demands future success will depend on the company s ability to adapt in this rapidly evolving environment 
the company could incur substantial costs if it has to modify its business to adapt to these changes  and may even be unable to adapt to these changes 
the company competes in a highly competitive market  which is likely to become more competitive 
competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements 
zebra faces significant competition in developing and selling its systems 
principal competitors have substantial marketing  financial  development and personnel resources 
to remain competitive  the company believes it must continue to provide technologically advanced systems that satisfy the user demands  superior customer service  high levels of quality and reliability  and dependable and efficient distribution networks zebra cannot assure it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
increased competition in printers or supplies may result in price reductions  lower gross profit margins and loss of market share  and could require increased spending on research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products 
any of these factors could reduce the company s earnings 
the inability to protect intellectual property could harm the company s reputation  and its competitive position may be materially damaged 
zebra s intellectual property is valuable and provides the company with certain competitive advantages 
copyrights  patents  trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of the company s products or  without authorization  to obtain and use information which zebra regards as trade secrets 
zebra sells a significant portion of its products internationally and purchases important components from foreign suppliers 
these circumstances create a number of risks 
the company sells a significant amount of its products to customers outside the united states 
shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales 
risks associated with sales and purchases outside the united states include fluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales  or increase costs of purchasing  in foreign countries 
foreign governments may impose burdensome tariffs  quotas and taxes or other trade barriers 
political and economic instability may reduce demand for our products  or put our foreign assets at risk 
restrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets 
potentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries  such as china  may limit recourse against infringing products or cause the company to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories 
staffing and managing international operations may be unusually difficult 
the company may not be able to control international distributors working on its behalf 
economic factors  which are outside the company s control  could lead to deterioration in the quality of the company s accounts receivables 
the company sells its products to customers in the united states and several other countries around the world 
sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms  which are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in a given country 
a deterioration of economic or political conditions in a country could impair zebra s ability to collect on receivables in the affected country 
infringement on the proprietary rights of others could put the company at a competitive disadvantage  and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly 
third parties may claim that zebra violated their intellectual property rights 
to the extent of a violation of a third party s patent or other intellectual property right  the company may be prevented from operating its business as planned  and may be required to pay damages  to obtain a license  if available  or to use a non infringing method  if possible  to accomplish its objectives 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel 
the company depends on the ongoing service of its senior management and ability to attract and retain other key personnel 
future success of the company is substantially dependent on the continued service and continuing contributions of senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of the service of any of executive officer or other key employees could adversely affect business 
the company neither has long term employment agreements with key personnel  nor maintains key man life insurance policies on any of its key employees 
the ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees is important to zebra s long term success 
competition for personnel in the company s industry is intense  and the company may be unable to retain key employees or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
continued terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect the company s stock price  operations  and profitability 
the terrorist attacks that occurred in the united states on september  caused periodic major instability in the us and other financial markets 
possible further acts of terrorism and current and future war risks could have a similar impact 
the united states continues to take military action against terrorism and has made strong overtures of going to war with iraq 
terrorist attacks and potential war in the middle east may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability 
any such attacks could  among other things  cause further instability in financial markets and could directly  or indirectly through reduced demand  negatively affect the company s facilities and operations or those of its customers or suppliers 
taxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves 
the company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions in the united states and worldwide  and uses strategies to minimize its tax exposure 
local tax authorities may challenge these tax positions from time to time 
adverse outcomes in these situations may exceed the company s reserves for tax payments and may increase the company s effective tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates because of its large investment portfolio 
as stated in the company s written investment policy  the company s investment portfolio is viewed as a strategic resource that will be managed to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk  which includes the risk of interest rate movements 
risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital across each quarterly reporting cycle 
the company mitigates interest rate risk with an investment policy that requires the use of outside professional investment managers  investment liquidity and broad diversification across investment strategies  and which limits the types of investments that may be made 
moreover  the policy requires due diligence of each investment manager both before employment and on an ongoing basis 
the following table sets forth the impact of a movement in interest rates on the value of the company s investment portfolio as of december  interest rate sensitive instruments effect on pretax income effect on diluted eps after tax movement  movement  foreign exchange risk the company conducts business in approximately countries throughout the world and  therefore  is exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates 
currency exposures are related to the us dollar uk pound sterling  dollar uk dollar euro  and the dollar uk pound sterling euro exchange rates arising from invoicing european customers in pounds sterling and euros from the company s uk office 
the uk dollar japanese yen exchange rate arises from invoicing customers in japanese yen 
the yen foreign currency exposure averages approximately  there is no foreign exchange risk associated with the company s investment portfolio 
the company manages its foreign exchange exposure through a policy of selective hedging 
this policy involves selling forward up to days projected remittances in euros from the company s uk subsidiary 
currency swaps that are net settled every month mitigate the us dollar to us pound sterling net exposure 
this policy mitigates  but does not eliminate  the impact of exchange movements on the value of future cash flows 
thus  adverse movements in either the pound or the euro in relation to the dollar can directly affect the company s financial results 
the corporate treasury department executes all foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions only 
under no circumstances does the company enter into any type of foreign exchange contract for trading or speculative purposes 
the following table sets forth the impact of a movement in the dollar pound and dollar euro rates measured as if the company did not engage in the selective hedging practices described above 
it is based on the dollar euro and dollar pound exchange rates and euro and pound denominated assets and liabilities as of december  foreign exchange effect on pretax income effect on diluted eps after tax dollar pound  dollar euro  equity price risk from time to time  the company has taken direct equity positions in companies 
these investments relate to potential acquisitions and other strategic business opportunities 
to the extent that it has a direct investment in the equity securities of another company  the company is exposed to the risks associated with such investments 
the company currently employs three investment managers  two of which manage portfolios of investment funds ie fund of funds 
these investment funds use a variety of investment strategies  some of which involve the use of equity securities 
each investment manager s portfolio is designed to be market neutral  although an individual fund within a portfolio may be exposed to market risk
