item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in the form k 
see disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
general our electrical contracting business is operated in two segments commercial and industrial and residential 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of these reportable segments 
in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to our reported financial status by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition  the assessment of goodwill impairment  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the recording of our self insurance liabilities and our estimation of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
these accounting policies  as well as others  are described in the note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we enter into contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids 
we frequently negotiate the final terms and prices of those contracts with the customer 
although the terms of our contracts vary considerably  most are made on either a fixed price or unit price basis in which we agree to do the work for a fixed amount for the entire project fixed price or for units of work performed unit price 
we also perform services on a cost plus or time and materials basis 
we are generally able to achieve higher margins on fixed price and unit price than on cost plus contracts 
we currently generate  and expect to continue to generate  more than half of our revenues under fixed price contracts 
our most significant cost drivers are the cost of labor  the cost of materials and the cost of casualty and health insurance 
these costs may vary from the costs we originally estimated 
variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price and unit price contracts may result in actual revenue and gross profits for a project differing from those we originally estimated and could result in losses on projects 
depending on the size of a particular project  variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
we believe our exposure to losses on fixed price contracts is limited in aggregate by the high volume and relatively short duration of the fixed price contracts we undertake 
additionally  we derive a significant amount of our revenues from new construction and from the southern part of the united states 
downturns in new construction activity or in construction in the southern united states could affect our results 
we complete most projects within one year 
we frequently provide service and maintenance work under open ended  unit price master service agreements which are renewable annually 
we recognize revenue on service and time and material work when services are performed 
work performed under a construction contract generally provides that the customers accept completion of progress to date and compensate us for services rendered measured in terms of units installed  hours expended or some other measure of progress 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
percentage of completion for construction contracts is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
we generally consider contracts to be substantially complete upon departure from the work site and acceptance by the customer 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation costs 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated contract costs and profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and the effects of these revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
provisions for total estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
included in this evaluation are certain assumptions and estimates to determine the fair values of reporting units such as estimates of future cash flows  discount rates  as well as assumptions and estimates related to the valuation of other identified intangible assets 
changes in these assumptions and estimates or significant changes to the market value of our common stock could materially impact our results of operations or financial position 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for unknown collection issues in addition to reserves for specific accounts receivable where collection is considered doubtful 
inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including  among others  our customers access to capital  our customers willingness to pay  general economic conditions and the ongoing relationships with our customers 
we are insured for workers compensation  automobile liability  general liability and employee related health care claims  subject to large deductibles 
our general liability program provides coverage for bodily injury and property damage neither expected nor intended 
losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
the accruals are derived from actuarial studies  known facts  historical trends and industry averages utilizing the assistance of an actuary to determine the best estimate of the ultimate expected loss 
we believe such accruals to be adequate 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
therefore  if actual experience differs from than the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation  adjustments to the reserve may be required and would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known 
we regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain 
we perform this evaluation at least annually at the end of each fiscal year 
the estimation of required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets at september   we considered whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if actual future taxable income differs from our estimates  our results could be affected 
results of operations the following table presents selected historical results of operations of ies and subsidiaries with dollar amounts in thousands 
these historical statements of operations include the results of operations for businesses acquired through purchases beginning on their respective dates of acquisition 
year ended september  in thousands revenues    cost of services    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses    restructuring charges  goodwill amortization  income from operations    interest and other expense  net    income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle    provision for income taxes    cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax  net income loss    year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues year ended september  percentage of total percentage revenues growth decline commercial and industrial residential total company revenues decreased million  or  from  million for the year ended september  to  million for the year ended september  the decrease in total revenues is the result of million in lost revenues on divested or closed companies that were included in revenues for the year ended september   but not during the year ended september  these lost revenues were partially offset by million of revenues from an acquisition during the year ended september  the decline in commercial and industrial revenues is attributable to million decline in communications work due to market contractions  particularly in california  colorado  washington  dc and virginia 
the decrease in residential revenues is attributable to a million decline in multi family residential construction projects  primarily in colorado and maryland  offset by a million increase in single family construction spending 
we believe record low interest rates during the last months is driving demand for new homes  leading to record levels of single family residential construction spending 
as families move into their new single family homes  the demand for multi family housing has dropped 
gross margin segment gross margins as a percentage of total revenues year ended september  commercial and industrial residential total company gross profit decreased million  or from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  the decline in commercial and industrial gross profit was due to lower revenues earned year over year as discussed and due to a shift in the type of commercial and industrial work performed during the year ended september  the related service and maintenance work for commercial and industrial customers  which tends to earn higher gross margins than fixed price contracts  declined million in gross profit during the year 
this decline was moderated by a million increase in larger project work awarded during the year  particularly industrial contracts in excess of million 
these larger projects produce gross profits but tend to earn lower gross margins as a percentage of revenue due to the competitive bidding procedures in place to be awarded this type of work 
the shift of project work from small projects such as the service and maintenance work to larger projects in excess of million impacted gross profits by approximately million 
overall gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased approximately from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  had we earned last year s gross margin of  gross profit for the year ended september  would have been million  an increase of million 
the decline in gross margin during the year ended september  was due to the shift in type of commercial and industrial work performed and due to the increased competition for available residential work 
we believe record low interest rates during the last months is driving demand for new homes  leading to record levels of single family residential construction spending 
this increased demand for residential construction has increased pricing pressure for available work  particularly affecting our operating units that perform limited amounts of residential work in addition to their commercial and industrial contract expertise 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  this decline is due to the organizational restructuring that occurred during the year ended september  in the last months  we have combined administrative offices and functions  leading to a decline in operating locations from approximately locations to approximately locations 
we also divested or closed non performing companies  which decreased our selling  general and administrative cost structure by approximately million 
finally  we streamlined our administrative cost structure  yielding savings of million in salaries and benefits 
as a result of these changes  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  restructuring charges in october we began implementation of a workforce reduction program 
the purpose of this program was to cut costs by reducing the number of administrative staff both in the field and at the home office 
the total number of terminated employees was approximately as a result of the program implementation  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million associated with employees during the year ended september  and presented these charges as a separate component of our results of operations for the period then ended 
no restructuring charges were incurred for the year ended september  the charges were based on the costs of the workforce reduction program and include severance and other special termination benefits 
we believe the reduction of these personnel resulted in annual savings of approximately million in salaries and benefits 
at september   approximately million of these charges that related to five individuals had not been paid and were included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
at september   approximately million of these charges that relate to three individuals have not been paid and are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
we anticipate making the remaining payments accrued under this restructuring during the year ended september  income from operations income from operations increased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  as a percentage of revenues  income from operations increased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  this increase in income from operations was primarily attributed to million in restructuring charges recorded during the year ended september   and a million decrease selling  general and administrative expenses year over year  offset by a million decline in gross profits earned during the year ended september  interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in interest expense during the year ended september  due to a lower amount of average debt outstanding during the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  other expense  net included a million gain from the sale of certain subsidiaries 
this was a decrease from last year s other expense  net  which included million gain resulting from the retirement of million of our senior subordinated notes due february  in the last quarter of the year ended september   a million net gain resulting from the sale of certain subsidiaries and offset by a million loss recorded on our investment in energy photovoltaics  inc and losses on sales of assets of million 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  this decrease is attributable to the release of million of tax effected valuation allowances that were included in income during the year ended september  we released these valuation allowances because we believe that we will now realize a portion of the deferred tax assets for which they were established 
without the impact of these valuation allowance releases  our effective tax rate for the year ended september  was 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues year ended september  percent of total percentage revenues growth decline commercial and industrial residential total company revenues decreased million  or  from  million for the year ended september  to  million for the year ended september  the decrease in commercial and industrial revenues was primarily the result of million in non recurring work performed for one customer during the year ended september   a million decrease in revenues from communications work due to market contractions  particularly in california  colorado and arizona 
we also experienced a decrease in commercial and industrial revenues  which we attribute to increased competition for available work during the year ended september  this decline most significantly impacted our operations in georgia  north carolina and virginia  where revenues decreased million during the year ended september  gross margin segment gross margins as a percentage of total revenues year ended september  commercial and industrial residential total company gross profit decreased million  or from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  the overall decrease in gross profit was due to decreased gross profits of million associated with the million decline in revenues earned during the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  commercial and industrial gross profit was also decreased by million associated with companies divested during the year ended september   a million decline in gross profits earned on communications work due to a decline in work performed and lower margins earned on that work due to the decrease in market demand  and million in additional funding for our insurance reserves 
overall gross margin as a percentage of revenues decreased approximately from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  had we earned the gross margin of  gross profit for the year ended september  would have been million  an increase of million 
the decline in gross margin as a percentage of revenues was the result of increased competition due to decreased construction spending during the year ended september   a decrease on gross margins earned on communications work due to a decrease in market demand and million in additional funding for our self insurance reserves 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue remained the same at for and the decrease in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of the termination of certain administrative field and home office personnel during the year ended september  overall administrative personnel headcount declined by approximately employees during the year ended september   which led to a decrease of approximately million in salaries and benefits expenses for such personnel 
restructuring charges in october we began implementation of a workforce reduction program 
the purpose of this program was to cut costs by reducing the number of administrative staff both in the field and at the home office 
the total number of terminated employees was approximately as a result of the program implementation  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million associated with employees during the year ended september  and presented these charges as a separate component of our results of operations for the period then ended 
the charges were based on the costs of the workforce reduction program and include severance and other special termination benefits 
we believe the reduction of these personnel resulted in annual savings of approximately million in salaries and benefits 
at september   approximately million of these charges that related to five individuals had not been paid and were included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
income from operations income from operations decreased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  as a percentage of revenues  income from operations decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  this decrease in income from operations was primarily attributed to a million decrease in revenues year over year  a decline in margins earned on those revenues  funding for insurance reserves and restructuring charges of million incurred during the year ended september   partially offset by a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses and non recurring goodwill amortization of million incurred during the year ended september  in accordance with the current accounting standard 
interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net decreased million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily the result of a million gain resulting from the retirement of million of our senior subordinated notes due february  in the last quarter of the year ended september   a million net gain resulting from the sale of certain subsidiaries and offset by a million loss recorded on our investment in energy photovoltaics  inc and losses on sales of assets of million 
these amounts were offset by increased interest expenses associated with decreased average borrowings during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased from for the year ended september  to for the year ended september  the effective tax rate for the year ended september  included a provision for non deductible goodwill amortization expense while the effective tax rate for the year ended september  includes the effect of the projected utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards 
cost drivers as a service business  our cost structure is highly variable 
our primary costs include labor  materials and insurance 
approximately of our costs are derived from labor and related expenses 
for the years ended september   and  our labor related expenses totaled million  million and million  respectively 
as of september   we had approximately  employees 
approximately  employees were field electricians  the number of which fluctuates depending upon the number and size of the projects undertaken by us at any particular time 
approximately  employees were project managers  job superintendents and administrative and management personnel  including executive officers  estimators or engineers  office staff and clerical personnel 
we provide a health  welfare and benefit plan for all employees subject to eligibility requirements 
we have a k plan pursuant to which eligible employees may make contributions through a payroll deduction 
we make matching cash contributions of of each employee s contribution up to of that employee s salary 
we also have an employee stock purchase plan that provides that eligible employees may contribute up to of their cash compensation  up to  annually  toward the annual purchase of our common stock at a discounted price 
over of our employees participated in the employee stock purchase plan during the year ended september  approximately of our costs incurred are for materials installed on projects 
this component of our expense structure is variable based on the demand for our services 
we generally incur costs for materials once we begin work on a project 
we generally order materials when needed  ship them directly to the jobsite and install them within days 
materials consist of commodity based items such as conduit  wire and fuses as well as specialty items such as fixtures  switchgear and control panels 
for the years ended september and  our materials expenses net of rebates received totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we are insured for workers compensation  employer s liability  auto liability  general liability and health insurance  subject to large deductibles 
losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon actuarial studies and our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
the accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate 
expenses for claims administration  claims funding and reserves funding totaled million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
working capital september  in thousands  except for ratios current assets cash and cash equivalents   accounts receivable trade  net of allowance of  and  respectively   retainage   related party costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts   inventories   prepaid expenses and other current assets   total current assets   current liabilities current maturities of long term debt accounts payable and accrued expenses   billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts   total current liabilities   working capital   total current assets increased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  this increase is primarily the result of a million increase in cash and cash equivalents due to million in cash provided by operations during the year ended september  offset by million in cash used in investing activities and million used in financing activities 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further information 
current assets were further increased by an million increase in trade accounts receivable  net due to the timing of collections  a million increase in retainage due to the timing of retention billings and a million increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts due to the timing of billings on projects in progress 
current assets were reduced by an million decrease in prepaids and other current assets due to an million decrease in short term deferred tax assets due to the recognition of deferred tax assets existing at september  and a million decrease in other prepaid expenses due to the amortization of prepaid expenses outstanding as of september  current assets were further reduced by a million decrease in inventories due to the installation of purchased materials at september  for certain projects in progress during the year ended september  total current liabilities decreased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  this decrease is primarily the result of a million decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted projects due to the timing of billings on projects in progress  a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments made and a million decrease in current maturities of long term debt due to payments made on short term debt 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million  no borrowings under our credit facility  million outstanding of senior subordinated notes  million of letters of credit outstanding and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility of million 
during the year ended september   we generated million of net cash from operating activities 
this net cash from operating activities was comprised of net income of million  increased by million of non cash charges and million of deferred income taxes and decreased by million in working capital changes 
non cash charges included depreciation and amortization expense  provision for allowance for doubtful accounts  changes in deferred income taxes and losses on sales of property and equipment 
working capital changes consisted of a million decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted projects and a million increase in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
these working capital changes were offset by a million decrease in inventory and a million decrease in payables offset by a million decrease in receivables as a result of the timing of collections  with the balance of the change due to other working capital changes 
net cash used in investing activities was million  including million used for capital expenditures and million used for the acquisition of a business  net of cash acquired  offset by million provided from divestitures and other 
net cash used by financing activities was million  resulting primarily from in repayments of debt and the repurchase of the senior subordinated notes and million for the acquisition of treasury stock 
during the year ended september   we completed a million share repurchase program 
we used approximately million in cash generated from operations to repurchase shares during the year ended september  on november   we commenced a million share repurchase plan which we expect to complete primarily through open market purchases during the year ended september  we expect to fund this program with existing cash and cash flow from operations 
on may   we amended our million revolving credit facility to a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lending institutions to be used for working capital  capital expenditure  acquisitions and other corporate purposes that matures may   as amended 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to either a the london interbank offered rate libor plus percent to percent  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facility or b the higher of i the bank s prime rate or ii the federal funds rate plus percent plus an additional percent to percent  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda 
commitment fees of percent to percent are assessed on any unused borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
our existing and future subsidiaries guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the facility  and the facility is secured by the capital stock of those subsidiaries and the accounts receivable of the company and those subsidiaries 
borrowings under the credit facility are limited to of outstanding receivables as defined in the agreement 
the credit facility requires the consent of the lenders for acquisitions exceeding a certain level of cash consideration  prohibits the payment of cash dividends on the common stock  restricts our ability to repurchase shares of common stock or to retire senior subordinated notes  restricts our ability to incur other indebtedness and requires us to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including certain financial covenants  some of which become more restrictive over time 
among other restrictions  the financial covenants include a minimum net worth requirement  a maximum total consolidated funded debt to ebitda ratio  a maximum senior consolidated debt to ebitda ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
for more information regarding the covenants to our credit facility  as amended  see our filing on form k dated may  we were in compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility  as amended  at september  as of november   we had no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility 
on january  and may   we completed our offerings of million and million senior subordinated notes  respectively 
the offering completed on may  yielded million in proceeds  net of a million discount and million in offering costs 
the proceeds from the may  offering were used primarily to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
the notes bear interest at and will mature on february  we pay interest on the notes on february and august of each year 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and are subordinated to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness 
the notes are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by all of our subsidiaries 
under the terms of the notes  we are required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including restrictions on additional indebtedness  and restrictions on liens  guarantees and dividends 
during the year ended september   we retired approximately million of these senior subordinated notes 
in connection with these transactions  we recorded a gain of million 
this gain is recorded in interest and other expense  net during the year ended september  in accordance with sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  which we adopted july  at september   we had million in outstanding senior subordinated notes 
in august we entered into an interest rate swap contract that had a notional amount of million and was established to manage the interest rate risk of the senior subordinated note obligations 
we terminated this contract in february we received cash equal to the fair value of this derivative of million  which is being amortized over the remaining life of the bonds 
in february we entered into a new interest rate swap contract that had a notional amount of million and was established to manage the interest rate risk of the senior subordinated note obligations 
we terminated this contract in august we received cash equal to the fair value of this derivative of million  which is being amortized over the remaining life of the bonds 
at september  and we had no outstanding interest rate swap contracts 
effective october   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 all goodwill amortization ceased effective october  goodwill amortization for the years ended september  and would have otherwise been million before the impairment charge 
goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units was tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value was determined using discounted cash flows  market multiples and market capitalization 
these impairment tests are required to be performed at adoption of sfas no 
and at least annually thereafter 
significant estimates used in the methodologies include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long term growth rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market multiples for each of the reportable units 
on an ongoing basis absent any impairment indicators  we expect to perform our impairment tests annually during the first fiscal quarter 
based on our impairment tests performed upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recognized a charge of million per share in the first quarter of to reduce the carrying value of goodwill of our reporting units to its implied fair value 
this impairment is a result of adopting a fair value approach  under sfas no 
 to testing impairment of goodwill as compared to the previous method utilized in which evaluations of goodwill impairment were made using the estimated future undiscounted cash flows compared to the assets carrying amount 
the impairment was the result of lower forecasted future operating income at the point of adoption than we anticipated to result from decreased spending in the construction industry in all of our markets 
the impairment related to our operating regions follows amounts in millions southeast northeast gulf plains central west residential divested after adoption total under sfas no 
 the impairment adjustment recognized at adoption of the new rules was reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the statement of operations for the year ended september  impairment adjustments recognized after adoption  if any  generally are required to be recognized as operating expenses 
on february  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets of riviera electric llc riviera out of a bankruptcy auction of a prior competitor 
riviera provides electrical contracting services in the state of colorado 
the purchase price consisted of approximately million of cash  net of cash acquired 
the cash used in this acquisition was funded by operations 
in december  we made an investment in energy photovoltaics  inc epv  based in lawrenceville  new jersey 
epv is a privately held developer and provider of proprietary thin film processes and equipment for manufacturing photovoltaic modules to provide solar energy 
at september   we had a carrying value of our under interest in epv of million and a million debt investment in epv 
we performed a discounted cash flow analysis at september  and determined that no impairment to this investment existed 
this investment involves certain risks involving demand for photovoltaic services 
if epv is unable to deliver on its business plan  we could deem this investment impaired and would record a charge to other expense in the period such impairment  if any  is determined 
all of our operating income and cash flows are generated by our wholly owned subsidiaries  which are the subsidiary guarantors of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes 
we are structured as a holding company and substantially all of our assets and operations are held by our subsidiaries 
there are currently no significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan 
the parent holding company s independent assets  revenues  income before taxes and operating cash flows are less than of the consolidated total 
the separate financial statements of the subsidiary guarantors are not included herein because i the subsidiary guarantors are all of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company  ii the subsidiary guarantors have fully and unconditionally  jointly and severally guaranteed the senior subordinated notes  and iii the aggregate assets  liabilities  earnings  and equity of the subsidiary guarantors is substantially equivalent to the assets  liabilities  earnings and equity of the company on a consolidated basis 
as a result  the presentation of separate financial statements and other disclosures concerning the subsidiary guarantors is not deemed material 
other commitments as is common in our industry  we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements that expose us to increased risk 
our significant off balance sheet transactions include commitments associated with noncancelable operating leases  letter of credit obligations and surety guarantees 
we enter into noncancelable operating leases for many of our vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to retain our cash when we do not own the vehicles or equipment and we pay a monthly lease rental fee 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
we may determine to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term 
typically we are liable to the lessor for various lease cancellation or termination costs and the difference between the then fair market value of the leased asset and the implied book value of the leased asset as calculated in accordance with the lease agreement 
some of our customers require us to post letters of credit as a means of guaranteeing performance under our contracts and ensuring payment by us to subcontractors and vendors 
if our customer has reasonable cause to effect payment under a letter of credit  we would be required to reimburse our creditor for the letter of credit 
depending on the circumstances surrounding a reimbursement to our creditor  we may have a charge to earnings in that period 
to date we have not had a situation where a customer has had reasonable cause to effect payment under a letter of credit 
at september   million of our outstanding letters of credit were to collateralize our customers 
some of the underwriters of our casualty insurance program require us to post letters of credit as collateral 
this is common in the insurance industry 
to date we have not had a situation where an underwriter has had reasonable cause to effect payment under a letter of credit 
at september   million of our outstanding letters of credit were to collateralize our insurance program 
many of our customers require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a surety 
those bonds guarantee the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
in the event that we fail to perform under a contract or pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand the surety to pay or perform under our bond 
our relationship with our sureties is such that we will indemnify the sureties for any expenses they incur in connection with any of the bonds they issues on our behalf 
to date  we have not incurred significant costs to indemnify our sureties for expenses they incurred on our behalf 
as of september   our cost to complete projects covered by surety bonds was approximately million 
in april  we committed to invest up to million in enertech capital partners ii lp enertech 
enertech is a private equity firm specializing in investment opportunities emerging from the deregulation and resulting convergence of the energy  utility and telecommunications industries 
through september   we had invested million under our commitment to enertech 
at september   the carrying value of our investment in enertech was million 
our investment in enertech is accounted for on the cost basis of accounting and  accordingly  we do not record unrealized losses on investments within the enertech investment that we believe are temporary in nature 
at september   the unrealized losses related to our share of the enertech fund amounted to approximately million which we believe to be temporary in nature 
if facts arise that lead us to determine that such unrealized losses are not temporary  we would write down our investment in enertech through a charge to other expense during the period of such determination 
our future contractual obligations include in thousands thereafter total debt and capital lease obligations   operating lease obligations        debt and capital lease obligations are presented without interest 
our other commercial commitments expire as follows in thousands thereafter total standby letters of credit   other commercial commitments   balance of investment commitment in enertech 
outlook economic conditions across the country are challenging 
we continue to focus on collecting receivables and reducing days sales outstanding 
to improve our position for continued success  we continue to take steps to reduce costs 
we have made significant cuts in administrative overhead at the home office and in the field 
the economic outlook for fiscal is still somewhat uncertain 
we expect earnings in the first quarter of fiscal to range between and per share 
for the year ended september   we expect earnings to range between and per share excluding any potential goodwill impairment charges 
we expect to generate cash flow from operations 
our cash flows from operations tend to track with the seasonality of our business and historically have improved in the latter part of our fiscal year 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs  debt service requirements and capital expenditures for property and equipment through the next twelve months 
we expect capital expenditures of approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  our ability to generate cash flow from operations is dependent on many factors  including demand for our products and services  the availability of work at margins acceptable to us and the ultimate collectibility of our receivables 
see disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
seasonality and cyclical fluctuations our results of operations from residential construction are seasonal  depending on weather trends  with typically higher revenues generated during spring and summer and lower revenues during fall and winter 
the commercial and industrial aspect of our business is less subject to seasonal trends  as this work generally is performed inside structures protected from the weather
