item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
general we are a leading provider of contract land drilling services in the united states with a fleet of rigs  of which rigs are currently marketed 
included in the marketed fleet is one non owned rig that we operate for a third party 
rig activity after approximately two years of increasing rig utilization and dayrates  demand for land drilling rigs began to decline late in the third quarter of from the second quarter of until the end of january  rig counts stabilized and our rig count averaged between to rigs working each week 
beginning in february  however  we have seen an increase in the amount of future work for our rigs currently operating in the form of signed contracts and oral commitments from our customers 
at february   we had rigs working 
the table below shows the average number of our rigs working in our operating markets during the periods indicated 
full full full q to year q q q q year q q q q year date drilling contract bid rates dayrates are generally driven by utilization and  with the decline in the number of rigs running beginning in late  we also experienced a drop in dayrates 
from the high leading edge bid rates of  to  per rig day without fuel or top drives in april  our daywork bid rates declined to the current daywork bid rates between  and  per rig day without fuel or top drives 
based upon the recent increase in rig activity  we believe that these rates mark the low point of the down cycle and should rise as utilization increases 
the timing or occurrence of such an event cannot be assured 
we currently own top drives for which our current bid rates are approximately  per rig day 
bid rates for our top drives are in addition to the above stated bid rates for our rigs 
term contracts whenever market conditions allow  we strive to utilize term contracts to provide drilling services on a daywork basis 
during late and  the use of term contracts enabled us to maintain higher margins than would otherwise be attainable during the latest downturn 
if current market conditions do not improve as our remaining term contracts expire  there will be a further decline in our operating margin as rigs go to work under lower spot market rate contracts 
our term contracts contain termination provisions which require our customers  upon cancellation of a contract  to pay an amount that approximates our operating margin for the remaining days of the contract 
we have approximately rig days contracted under term contracts in  of which days are in the first quarter  days in the second quarter  days in the third quarter  and days in the fourth quarter 
turnkey and footage contract activity during all phases of the industry cycle  turnkey work continues to be an important part of our business strategy 
our engineering and operating experience allows us to provide this service to our customers and has historically provided higher margins than would otherwise have been obtainable under daywork contracts 
during the fourth quarter of  our turnkey operating margin was  per rig day compared to a daywork operating margin of  per rig day 
for the year ended december   our turnkey operating margin per rig day was  compared to a daywork operating margin per day of  the operating margins generated on turnkey and footage contracts varies widely based upon a number of factors  including the location of the contracted work as well as the depth and level of complexity of the wells drilled 
the demand for drilling services under turnkey and footage contracts has historically been greater during periods of overall lower demand 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the current level of revenue or operating margins derived from turnkey and footage contracts 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements require our management to make subjective estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
however  these estimates  judgments and assumptions concern matters that are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management 
the accounting policies that we believe are critical are property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets  revenue recognition  insurance accruals  and income taxes 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost with depreciation calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we expense our maintenance and repairs costs as incurred 
we estimate the useful lives of our assets are between three and fifteen years 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such indicators include changes in our business plans  a change in the physical condition of a long lived asset or the extent or manner in which it is being used  or a severe or sustained downturn in the oil and gas industry 
if a review of our long lived assets indicates that the carrying value of certain of these assets is more than the estimated undiscounted cash flows  a write down of the assets to their estimated fair market value must be made 
the estimated fair market value is the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best estimate of fair market value  however  quoted market prices will generally not be available 
as a result  fair value must be determined based upon other valuation techniques 
this could include appraisals or present value calculations 
the calculation of undiscounted future net cash flows and fair market value is based on estimates and projections 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax non cash asset impairment charge of million in accordance with sfas after review of our rigs held for future refurbishment  we no longer intend to return five of those rigs to service  but will instead use their component parts as spare equipment inventory 
this decision was made based upon the physical condition of the five rigs and the estimated cost of refurbishment 
as such  we recorded the charge to write the rigs down to their fair market value and revised the number of drilling rigs in our fleet from to  including one non owned rig that we operate for a third party 
the fair market value was based on an appraisal obtained from a third party appraiser 
the after tax effect of this impairment charge was 
per diluted share 
revenue recognition 
revenue from daywork and footage contracts is recognized when earned as services are performed under the provisions of the contract 
revenue from turnkey drilling contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon costs incurred to date and estimated total contract costs 
provision for anticipated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts is made at the time our estimated costs exceed the contract revenue 
insurance accruals 
we maintain insurance coverage related to workers compensation and general liability claims up to million per occurrence with an aggregate of million under general liability 
these policies include deductibles of  per occurrence 
in addition  we are self insured for our employee health plan but purchase stop loss coverage in order to limit our exposure to a maximum of  per occurrence under the plan 
if losses should exceed the workers compensation and general liability policy amounts  we have excess liability coverage up to a maximum of million with deductibles per occurrence of either  or  the provision for losses incurred within the deductible and stop loss amounts involves estimates by management and we base these estimates on our historical claims experience 
income taxes 
our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards nol s which expire from to deferred tax assets must be assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
at december   we do not have a valuation allowance as we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate future taxable income sufficient to recover our deferred tax assets 
our business  however  is extremely cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in oil and natural gas prices and demand for our services and there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments will not impact our ability to recover our deferred tax assets 
in addition  we have million in permanent differences which relate to differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of acquired assets 
the permanent difference will be reduced as the assets are depreciated for financial accounting purposes on a straight line basis over the next years 
as the amortization of these permanent differences is a fixed amount  our effective tax rate varies widely based upon the current level of income or loss 
see footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our statutory to effective tax rate 
financial results our net loss for was million compared with net income of million for revenue for was million compared with million for the year for the fourth quarter of our net loss was million and revenues were million 
this compares to net income of million and revenues of million in the fourth quarter of our operating margin for the fourth quarter of was  per rig day  compared to the third quarter operating margin of  per rig day and fourth quarter operating margin of  per rig day 
our operating margins for the years ended december  and were  per rig day and  per rig day  respectively 
financial outlook based on currently anticipated levels of activity and dayrates  we expect to generate an operating margin of approximately  per rig day for the first quarter of this operating margin level should generate earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of approximately million 
net loss per share is expected to be approximately 
on a diluted basis  assuming an annual tax benefit rate of between and 
we expect depreciation expense of approximately million for the first quarter of we project capital expenditures for to be between million and million subject to the actual level of rig activity 
these projections are forward looking statements and while we believe our estimates are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
see item business forward looking statements for important factors that could cause actual results to be differ materially from our expectations 
financial condition and liquidity the following table summarizes our financial position as of december  and december  december  december  in thousands amount amount working capital   property and equipment  net   other noncurrent assets   total   long term debt   other long term liabilities   shareholders equity   total   the significant changes in our financial position from december  to december  are the decreases in net property and equipment of million  other long term liabilities of million  and shareholders equity of million 
the decrease in net property and equipment is due primarily to million of depreciation expense and the million pre tax non cash asset impairment charge partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
other long term liabilities decreased due to lower deferred tax liabilities of million as a result of a net loss of million in shareholders equity also decreased due to the net loss in slightly offset by stock option exercises 
senior notes in june and may  we concluded public offerings of million and million  respectively  in principal amount of senior notes 
the senior notes notes bear interest at per annum and mature july  the notes are general unsecured senior obligations and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  on a joint and several basis  by all of our domestic wholly owned subsidiaries 
non guarantor subsidiaries are immaterial 
we have the option to redeem the notes in whole or in part during the twelve months beginning july  at  beginning july  at  beginning july  at and beginning july  and thereafter at together with any interest accrued and unpaid to the redemption date 
upon a change of control as defined in the indentures  each holder of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the aggregate principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase 
we may also  from time to time  seek to retire the notes through open market purchases and privately negotiated transactions 
the indentures for the notes permit us and our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  including senior indebtedness of up to million aggregate principal amount which may be secured by liens on all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries  subject to certain limitations 
the indentures contain other covenants limiting our ability and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  make certain investments  incur additional indebtedness  permit liens  incur dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries  enter into consolidation  merger  conveyance  lease or transfer transactions  make asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates or engage in unrelated lines of business 
these covenants are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications 
the indentures consider non compliance with the limitations events of default 
in addition to non payment of interest and principal amounts  the indentures also consider default with respect to other indebtedness in excess of million an event of default 
in the event of a default  the principal and interest could be accelerated upon written notice by or more of the holders of our senior notes 
we are in compliance with these covenants 
we owe a total of million in principal amount under our senior notes 
while the principal is not due until  semi annual interest payments of approximately million are due on january and july of each year 
for the year ended december   our operating activities provided cash  while our investing and financing activities consumed cash 
to the extent we are unable to generate cash flow sufficient to pay debt service and meet our other cash needs  including capital expenditures  we would be required to use our cash on hand 
at february   our cash balance was million 
cit facility we have a million credit facility with the cit group business credit  inc cit facility which expires during january the cit facility provides us with the ability to borrow up to the lesser of million or of the orderly liquidation value as defined in the agreement of certain drilling rig equipment located in the contiguous states of united states of america 
at december   the orderly liquidation value was greater than million 
the cit facility is a revolving facility with automatic renewals after expiration unless terminated by the lender on any subsequent anniversary date and then only upon days prior notice 
periodic interest payments are due at a floating rate based upon our debt service coverage ratio within a range of either libor plus to or prime plus to 
we recently amended the cit facility to increase the availability of letters of credit from million to million 
this was done to enable us to issue additional letters of credit for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which may become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts 
see item business insurance 
we are required to pay a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the cit facility and letters of credit accrue a fee of per annum 
outstanding letters of credit reduce the amount available for borrowing under the cit facility 
the cit facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants and we are in compliance with these covenants 
substantially all of our assets  including our drilling equipment  are pledged as collateral under the cit facility and it is also secured by our guarantees and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries guarantees 
we  however  retain the option  subject to a minimum appraisal value  under the cit facility to extract million of the equipment out of the collateral pool in connection with the sale or exchange of such collateral or relocation of equipment outside the contiguous states of the united states of america 
we currently have no outstanding balance under the cit facility and had million of undrawn letters of credit outstanding at december  under the cit facility the lender s commitments of million will be reduced by the amount of net cash proceeds received by us or our subsidiaries from sales or other dispositions of collateral in excess of million individually or million in the aggregate in any month period other than sales or other dispositions of certain types of inventory  rigs identified in the cit facility as equipment held for sale and up to million of rigs and accessories 
in addition  mandatory prepayments would be required upon the receipt of net proceeds received by us or our subsidiaries from the incurrence of certain other debt or sales of debt or equity securities in a public offering or private placement  or  the receipt of net cash proceeds by us or our subsidiaries from asset sales including proceeds from sale of rigs identified in the credit agreement as equipment held for sale  but excluding proceeds from dispositions of inventory in the ordinary course of business  and sales of up to million of rigs and rig accessories or  the receipt of insurance proceeds on our assets in each case to the extent that such proceeds are in excess of  individually or million in the aggregate in any twelve month period 
among the various covenants that we must satisfy under the cit facility are the following two covenants which apply whenever our liquidity  defined as the sum of cash  cash equivalents and availability under the cit facility  falls below million 
to ebitda coverage of debt service  tested monthly on a trailing month basis  and minimum tangible net worth all as defined in the cit facility at the end of each quarter will be at least the prior year tangible net worth less million adjusted for quarterly tests 
additionally  if the total amount outstanding under the cit facility including outstanding letters of credit exceeds of the orderly liquidation value of our domestic rigs  we are required to make a prepayment in the amount of the excess 
also  if the average rig utilization rate falls below for two consecutive months  the lender will have the option to request one additional appraisal per year to aid in determining the current orderly liquidation value of the drilling equipment 
average rig utilization is defined as the total number of rigs owned which are operating under drilling contracts in the contiguous states of the united states of america divided by the total number of rigs owned  excluding rigs not capable of working without substantial capital investment 
the cit facility also contains provisions restricting our ability to  among other things engage in new lines of business unrelated to our current activities  enter into mergers or consolidations or asset sales or purchases with specified exceptions  incur liens or debts or make advances  investments or loans in each case  with specified exceptions  pay dividends or redeem stock except for certain inter company transfers  prepay or materially amend any other indebtedness  and issue any stock other than common stock 
events of default under the cit facility include  in addition to non payment of amounts due  misrepresentations and breach of loan covenants and certain other events of default default with respect to other indebtedness in excess of judgments in excess of  or a change in control which means that we cease to own of our two principal subsidiaries  some person or group has either acquired beneficial ownership of or more of the company or obtained the power to elect a majority of our board of directors  or our board of directors ceases to consist of a majority of continuing directors all defined by the cit facility 
certain contractual commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and related payments due by period at december  amounts in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligation total year years years years senior notes principal   interest     operating leases  total contractual cash obligations     assumes no acceleration of maturity dates due to redemption or to breach of  or default under  the terms of the applicable contractual obligation 
see senior notes above  for information relating to certain financial ratio covenants and certain other covenants the breach of which could cause a default under  and acceleration of the maturity date of  the senior notes 
our cit facility provides up to million for the issuance of letters of credit 
if letters of credit which we cause to be issued are drawn upon by the holders of those letters of credit  then we will become obligated to repay those amounts along with any accrued interest and fees 
letters of credit issued reduce the amount available for borrowing under the cit facility and  as a result  we had million available at december  the following table illustrates the undrawn outstanding letters of credit at december  and the potential maturities if drawn upon by the holders amounts in thousands payments due by period potential total less than over contractual obligation committed year years years years standby letters of credit   total contractual obligation   assumes no acceleration of maturity dates due to breach of  or default under  the potential contractual obligation 
cash flow the net cash provided by or used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized below amounts in thousands years ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities   net increase decrease in cash    our cash flows from operating activities are affected by a number of factors including the number of rigs under contract  whether the contracts are daywork  footage  or turnkey  and the rate received for these services 
our cash flow generated from operating activities during the year ended december  was million before changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to cash generated from operating activities during the year ended december  of million before changes in operating assets and liabilities 
this change is principally due to a decrease in operating days and a decrease in our per rig day operating margins between the two periods 
our cash flows from operating activities were also impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities which provided million and used million in cash flow for the years ended december  and  respectively 
generally  during times of increasing demand our changes in working capital will result in the use of cash flows due primarily to the build up of accounts receivable 
our cash flow generated from operating activities during the year ended december  was million before changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to cash generated in operating activities during the year ended december  of million before changes in operating assets and liabilities 
this change is principally due to an increase in operating days and a increase in our per rig day operating margins between the two periods 
our cash flows from operating activities were also impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities which used million and million in cash flow for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended december  primarily consisted of million of capital expenditures for sustaining our rigs  the acquisition of one additional top drive  and other capital items 
our cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended december  primarily consisted of million of capital expenditures for reactivating rigs  acquisition of drill pipe  drill collars and top drives  and other capital items 
cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended december   primarily consisted of million of capital expenditures for reactivating rigs  acquisition of top drives  and other capital items 
cash flow used by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted principally of million for repayment of long term lease obligations  partially offset by  from stock option exercises 
cash flow provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted principally of million from stock option exercises  partially offset by  for repayment of long term lease obligations 
cash flow provided by financing activities for the year ended december  primarily consisted of net proceeds of million and million from the sale of common stock and from stock option exercises  respectively  partially offset by million repayment of long term lease obligations 
results of operations our drilling contracts generally provide compensation on either a daywork  turnkey or footage basis 
however  successfully completed turnkey and footage contracts generally result in higher effective revenues per rig day worked than under daywork contracts 
operating margins per rig day worked on successful turnkey and footage jobs are also generally greater than under daywork contracts  although we are typically required to bear additional operating costs such as drill bits that would typically be paid by the customer under daywork contracts 
contract drilling revenues  drilling operating expenses and operating margins or losses on turnkey and footage contacts are affected by a number of variables  which include the depth of the well  geological complexities and the actual difficulties encountered in drilling the well 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  we have revised the presentation of reimbursements received for certain expenses in the periods presented 
these reimbursements are now included in contract drilling revenues on the consolidated statement of operations versus previously being recorded net of the incurred expenses in drilling operations expenses 
this reclassification had no effect on net income or cash flows 
the following tables highlight rig days worked  contract drilling revenues and drilling operating expenses for our daywork and turnkey operations for the years ended december   and for the year ended december  daywork turnkey operations operations total dollars in thousands  except averages per rig day worked rig days worked    contract drilling revenue    drilling operating expenses    operating margin loss    averages per rig day worked contract drilling revenue    drilling operating expenses    operating margin loss    for the year ended december  daywork turnkey operations operations total dollars in thousands  except averages per rig day worked rig days worked    contract drilling revenue    drilling operating expenses    operating margin loss    averages per rig day worked contract drilling revenue    drilling operating expenses    operating margin loss    for the year ended december  daywork turnkey operations operations total dollars in thousands  except averages per rig day worked rig days worked    contract drilling revenue    drilling operating expenses    operating margin loss    averages per rig day worked contract drilling revenue    drilling operating expenses    operating margin loss    drilling operating expenses exclude depreciation  and general and administrative expenses 
turnkey operations include the results from turnkey and footage contracts 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and contract drilling revenue decreased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to a decrease in total rig days worked of  days  or  and a decrease in the total average revenue per rig day of  or due to the downturn in drilling activity 
the decrease in the total rig days worked consists of  fewer rig days under daywork contracts and fewer rig days under turnkey contracts 
the decline in the total average revenue per day was due to the decrease in the daywork average revenue per rig day 
this was the result of lower dayrates and rigs rolling off higher rate term contracts onto lower rate spot market contracts 
turnkey average revenue per rig day was higher due to the location and complexity of the wells drilled during when compared to the same period in total drilling operating expenses decreased by approximately million  or to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is a result of the decreased level of activity from daywork operations 
drilling operating expenses on a per rig day basis increased overall principally due to a wage increase of effective june   the retention of our experienced toolpushers and drillers during the downturn  the cost of cold stacking rigs  and overhead and other fixed costs being spread over less days 
turnkey expenses were also higher due to the greater overall depth and complexity of turnkey wells drilled 
depreciation expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to additional depreciation attributable to equipment purchased and placed into service during and general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to  for severance costs and  of non cash compensation expense related to stock options as a result of the termination of employment of an officer in the first quarter of also contributing to the increase are higher insurance costs and higher professional fees 
the difference in interest expense for the years ended december  and is negligible as the average outstanding debt balance was virtually the same and the largest component of our debt structure is our senior notes which carry interest at a fixed rate 
interest income decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  due to lower interest rates in partially offset by higher cash balances 
cash balances were higher in as a result of an overall build in cash due to higher drilling activity and dayrates throughout net other income expense increased by  to income of  for the year ended december  from expense of  for the same period of the expense in related to the realization of  in previously unrealized foreign currency translation losses as a result of moving our venezuela rigs to the united states 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and contract drilling revenue increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase is due to an increase in total rig days worked of  days  or  and an increase in the total average revenue per rig day of  or 
the increase in the total days worked is the result of a increase in daywork drilling activity partially offset by a decrease in turnkey drilling activity 
the increase in the total average revenue per rig day is due to higher dayrates received from both daywork and turnkey operations 
drilling operating expenses increased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is the direct result of the overall increased level of activity from daywork operations and increases in wages partially offset by a decreased level of activity from turnkey operations discussed above 
operating expenses on a per rig day basis  however  decreased due to overhead items being spread over more days worked and a decrease in the percentage of turnkey days worked to total days worked from in to in the decrease in operating expenses on a per rig day basis was partially offset by wage increases of on july   on august   and on june  depreciation expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to additional depreciation attributable to equipment purchased and placed in service during the year ended december  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   due primarily to the increased level of our operating activity and accrual of performance based compensation 
the difference in interest expense for the years ended december  and is negligible as the average outstanding debt balance was virtually the same and the largest component of our debt structure is our senior notes which carry interest at a fixed rate 
interest income decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  due to lower interest rates in partially offset by higher cash balances 
cash balances were higher as a result of the issuance of million shares of common stock on april  and due to higher drilling activity and dayrates in net other income expense decreased by  to expense of  for the year ended december  from expense of  for the same period of due primarily to the realization of  in previously unrealized foreign currency translation losses as a result of moving our venezuela rigs to the united states 
inflation and changing prices contract drilling revenues do not necessarily track the changes in general inflation as they tend to respond to the level of activity of the oil and gas industry in combination with the supply of equipment and the number of competing companies 
capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas industry and to a lesser extent by changes in general inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our cit facility 
interest on borrowings under the cit facility accrues at a variable rate  using at our election either the prime rate plus to or libor plus to  depending upon our debt service coverage ratio for the trailing month period 
we currently have no outstanding balance under the cit facility and as such have no exposure at this time to a change in interest rates
