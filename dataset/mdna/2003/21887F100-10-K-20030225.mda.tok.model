item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
summary of critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe the following accounting policies for the year ended december   to be critical revenue revenue associated with up front license  technology access and research and development funding payments under collaborative agreements is recognized ratably over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research and development period 
generally our collaborative agreements have included a research and development phase that span a specified time period 
however  in certain cases the collaborative agreement specifies a research and development phase which culminates with the completion of a development work plan but does not have a fixed date and requires us to estimate the time period over which to recognize revenue 
our estimated time periods are based on management s estimate of the time required to achieve a particular development milestone considering experience with similar projects  level of effort and stage of development 
if our estimate of the research and development time period increases the amount of revenue we recognize related to up front license and technology access fees for a given period would decrease 
asset impairment on january   we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption  we performed a transitional impairment test on our recorded intangible assets that consisted primarily of acquisition related goodwill and lease intangibles 
we also performed a subsequent interim impairment test on march   due to the presence of impairment indicators as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this impairment test involved a two step approach 
step one required estimating the fair value of the company and comparing it to the carrying value of recorded and unrecorded assets 
since the carrying value of the recorded and unrecorded assets exceeded the estimated fair value  we performed the second step that required allocating the fair value to all of our assets and liabilities  including unrecorded intangibles  to determine the deemed fair value  if any  of goodwill 
both steps required us to make significant assumptions and estimates  including determining our fair value and the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
in addition  this process required us to estimate future cash flows from our research and development projects 
table of contents in process and the applicable discount rates 
we engaged an independent third party valuation specialist to assist us in our impairment analysis 
the analysis resulted in a million goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of  which represented the write off of all goodwill existing as of the date of the test 
in the event of future acquisitions that result in goodwill being recorded  we will be required to perform this test on at least an annual basis 
our intangible assets at december  consist primarily of facility leases assumed in the coulter acquisition  which were recorded at fair value on the acquisition date 
we expect to record losses related to these leases as we enter into sublease arrangements in the future 
commitments and contingencies we are involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we do not believe these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we have not accrued for any legal contingencies  as the probable outcomes of the cases are not known 
however  an unfavorable outcome of the litigation with idec could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results from the sale of bexxar therapy  if bexxar therapy is approved 
overview for over years  we have been engaged in discovery and development of innovative immunotherapeutic products to address debilitating and life threatening conditions caused by cancer  infectious disease and autoimmune disease 
creating successful immunotherapeutic products requires understanding and directing the body s immune system to prevent and fight disease 
variations in disease causing organisms and human genetics make immunotherapeutic product development a challenging  complex undertaking  but one that we believe will have a significant impact on human health in the coming years 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue resulted from collaborative agreements  and approximately  and  of our revenue resulted from funds awarded through government grants 
as of december   we had total stockholders equity of million 
we have entered into  and intend to continue to enter into  collaborative agreements at various stages in the research and development process 
we believe that this active corporate partnering strategy provides four distinct advantages it focuses on our fundamental strength in immunotherapeutic product discovery and selected product development  it capitalizes on our corporate partners strengths in product development  manufacturing and commercialization  it may enable us to retain significant downstream participation in product sales  and it reduces our financing requirements 
when entering into corporate partnering relationships  we seek to cover our research and development expenses through research funding  milestone payments  collaborative agreement credit lines  and technology and license fees 
we also endeavor to retain significant downstream participation in product sales through either profit sharing or product royalties paid on annual net sales 
our material collaborative agreements that continue to provide us with funding include the following kirin 
in december  we entered into a multiyear development and commercialization agreement with kirin for potential cancer vaccine for the treatment of multiple forms of cancer  including leukemia  myelodysplasia and melanoma 
under the agreement we granted kirin exclusive rights to develop and market vaccine products resulting from our wt antigen vaccine program in asia australasia 
we and kirin have agreed to share wt vaccine commercialization rights and kirin has agreed to fund one half of the research and development costs in north america 
we will retain 
table of contents marketing rights for the potential vaccine in europe 
upon effectiveness of the agreement  kirin paid us million in up front license fees  which is being recorded as revenue over the estimated research and development term 
under the terms of the agreement  kirin has agreed to co fund development of wt vaccine products and pay us success based milestone payments and royalties on future product sales in asia australasia 
kirin has the right to terminate our agreement in the event of our material breach 
if kirin terminates our agreement because of our material breach within months after the effective date of the agreement  kirin may choose to have us pay a termination fee rather than pursue any other rights and remedies 
kirin may also choose not to terminate the agreement for our material breach  no matter when the breach occurs  but instead may keep its licenses intact rather than pursue any other rights and remedies  in which case all of kirin s payment obligations to us will be reduced 
kirin also has the right to terminate our agreement at any time in north america  asia or both territories  and in any of these cases kirin must pay us a termination fee 
both we and kirin have the right to terminate the agreement before commercial launch of the first product if together we determine there are no products worthy of further development or if any product causes a serious adverse event 
however  if kirin chooses to terminate the agreement for development or adverse event reasons  we have the right to continue product development ourselves and depending on further development kirin may be obligated to pay us a termination fee 
if we choose to terminate the agreement for development or adverse event reasons  kirin will have the right to continue product development and pay us royalties in the event of product sales 
kirin also has the right to terminate our agreement in the event product development and commercialization is prevented due to certain third party intellectual property positions 
kirin also has the right to terminate our agreement if no product has successfully completed clinical trials by ten years after the effective date  if no product has achieved regulatory approval in the united states or japan by years after the effective date  our performance is delayed by at least months as a result of force majeure or we terminate or breach a third party license under which kirin is a sublicensee and as a result kirin is sued or kirin s rights under our agreement are materially diminished 
in addition  kirin also has the right to terminate the agreement for our bankruptcy or insolvency 
amersham health 
in october  we entered into an agreement whereby amersham health has agreed to market bexxar therapy in europe 
we and amersham health will cooperate to register bexxar in europe 
amersham health will be the holder of the maa for bexxar therapy in europe 
we will be responsible for the generation of clinical trial data to support registration in europe 
amersham health will be responsible for the manufacture and sale of bexxar in europe 
upon execution of the agreement amersham health purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  which represented a forty percent premium of approximately million to the then current market value of our common stock 
the premium has been accounted for as a nonrefundable license payment and was deferred and is being recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the agreement  consistent with our revenue recognition policy 
on december   in accordance with the terms of the agreement  we sold  shares of our common stock to amersham health for a total purchase price of million in cash 
at our option  amersham health has agreed to purchase from us an additional million of our common stock at market value on or before april  in addition  amersham health has agreed to pay us milestone payments upon regulatory approval in europe as well as milestone payments based on achievement of certain sales volume targets 
amersham health has agreed to pay us royalties on all future product sales in europe 
amersham health has the right to terminate our agreement for our material breach  insolvency  after october or if commercialization of bexxar in europe is blocked because another product is given orphan drug status or if the emea does not validate our maa because the emea determines that the maa is not sufficient 
medicis and zenyaku kogyo 
in august  we entered into a multiyear development  commercialization and license agreement covering our psoriasis immunotherapeutic product  pvac treatment  with medicis 
under the agreement we provide medicis exclusive rights to pvac treatment in the united states and canada 
we are predominately responsible for development and manufacturing  and 
table of contents medicis will be responsible for commercialization and distribution 
under the terms of the agreement  medicis may be required to pay us license fees  research funding and earned milestone payments  including commercialization and cumulative net sales threshold milestone payments 
medicis made a nonrefundable payment of million upon effectiveness of the agreement 
additionally  upon commercial sale of the product  medicis has agreed to purchase inventory from us and pay a royalty on net sales of the product 
in august  we entered into a corporate partnership with zenyaku kogyo for researching and developing pvac treatment 
under the agreement we granted zenyaku kogyo exclusive rights to pvac treatment in japan 
in may the year research term of the agreement expired and zenyaku kogyo s research funding obligation ceased 
under the terms of the agreement  zenyaku kogyo s rights to pvac treatment in japan continue and they are required to make future milestone payments based on successful clinical and commercial progress  and a royalty stream on future product sales 
each of medicis and zenyaku kogyo has the right to terminate its respective agreement upon our material default or insolvency 
in addition  medicis has the right to terminate our agreement if we fail to meet development milestones as a result of force majuere 
medicis also has the right to terminate our supply agreement if we fail to supply commercial product two or more times in any year period or three times during the term of the agreement or if  after a failure to supply  we cannot resume supply within months 
if medicis terminates our supply agreement for any of these reasons  our royalty from medicis would materially decrease 
zenyaku kogyo has the right to terminate our agreement after receipt of the final report from our next pvac treatment phase ii clinical trial  which we expect during  if we and zenyaku kogyo decide not to proceed with pvac treatment phase iii clinical trials or after commercial launch of pvac treatment  if pvac treatment is not sufficiently profitable or the sale of pvac is barred by the japanese government 
zambon group and the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco 
during may and june  we entered into corporate partnerships with zambon and jt  respectively  for the research  development and commercialization of vaccine products aimed at preventing and or treating lung cancer 
zambon has exclusive rights to develop and sell vaccine products in europe  the countries of the former soviet union  argentina  brazil and columbia and co exclusive rights in china 
under the june agreement we granted jt exclusive rights to develop and sell vaccine products outside of the territory licensed to zambon  including the united states and japan  and co exclusive rights to develop and sell vaccine products in china 
we also granted zambon a nonexclusive license and jt an option to formulate vaccines that may result from the collaboration using our microsphere delivery system with our proprietary adjuvants 
during  the year research terms of the agreements expired and the respective research funding obligations ceased 
in november  we and zambon amended our agreement so that we jointly fund clinical testing of a non small cell lung cancer vaccine 
in addition  zambon s option to sell million of our common stock back to us expired upon termination of the research phase 
in december  we recorded a milestone payment of million from zambon in connection with the filing of our ind for a lung cancer vaccine candidate in the united states 
in january  we amended and restated our agreement with jt so that we hold exclusive rights to all antigens discovered in our lung cancer vaccine program  in all countries previously licensed to jt  with the exception of rights associated with commercialization of a non small cell  lung carcinoma vaccine candidate in japan 
under the terms of our amended agreement with jt  jt will continue to hold an exclusive license to this vaccine candidate for development and commercialization in japan  and we will hold all rights in north america and in those territories not previously licensed to zambon 
in connection with the restructuring of the jt agreement  we and jt have agreed to pay each other fees  milestones and royalties in the event that development milestones and product sales are achieved 
gsk 
effective september  we entered into a comprehensive corporate partnership with gsk 
under the agreement we granted gsk an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and sell vaccine products and certain dendritic cell therapy products that incorporate antigens discovered or in licensed under this corporate partnership 
we also granted gsk license rights to develop  manufacture 
table of contents and sell passive immunotherapy products  such as t cell or antibody therapeutics  and therapeutic drug monitoring products  in each case that incorporate these antigens 
gsk s rights under the agreement are co exclusive with us in japan with respect to tuberculosis 
the rights that we granted to gsk under the collaboration and license agreement covered our cancer antigen discovery programs in breast  colon  ovarian and prostate cancer  our her neu breast and ovarian cancer vaccine program  our mammaglobin breast cancer vaccine program  and our infectious disease antigen discovery programs in c 
pneumoniae  c 
trachomatis and mycobacterium tuberculosis 
to the extent that clinical and commercial milestones in the programs are achieved  gsk is required to make payments to us 
the individual amounts of such payments vary  depending on the milestones achieved and the types of product sold 
gsk is also required to pay us future royalty payments on all products sales  which royalties vary depending on the types of products sold 
on august  the funded research and development period of our collaboration and license agreement with gsk terminated in all of the cancer fields covered by the agreement 
gsk extended the funded research and development period for an additional years through august for the research and development programs for tuberculosis and chlamydia vaccines 
under the terms of the extension  gsk is required to fund one half of the actual cost of the tuberculosis program and the cost of the chlamydia program for a year period 
in january  we and gsk entered into new agreements to further advance the development of multiple solid tumor vaccines 
one of the new agreements extends our and gsk s collaborative efforts into vaccine development and potential proof of principle clinical trials 
under the terms of this new agreement  gsk granted us a worldwide  exclusive license to develop a vaccine candidate for prostate cancer and a vaccine candidate for breast cancer 
as a part of this agreement  gsk retains the option to buy back exclusive worldwide rights for either or both vaccine candidates following the completion of proof of principle clinical trials 
if gsk exercises its buy back rights  we have the option of participating in further development  up to and including a sharing of promotion rights in the united states 
the buy back price will be based on our research costs incurred under this new agreement  plus a premium of and up to an additional million depending on the stage of development at the time gsk exercises its buy back option 
in the event gsk does not exercise its buy back option  we will be free to develop the vaccines alone or with other partners and have agreed to pay gsk success based milestones and royalties in the event of product sales 
under our new agreement  we will be responsible for providing resources and development funding of up to million to complete proof of principle clinical studies over a period of time in excess of years 
this funding will be used to pay for gmp grade material  production and clinical trials for prostate and breast vaccine development efforts 
under the original agreement  gsk will continue development of an alternative version of the prostate cancer vaccine at its own expense and has agreed to pay us milestones and royalties on potential product sales 
under the original agreement  gsk is also continuing the development of our her neu vaccine 
a proprietary formulation of this vaccine has been manufactured by gsk and an ind application has been approved for the product s clinical testing in the united states 
gsk has also agreed to pay us milestones and royalties on potential product sales of our her neu vaccine 
in a related new agreement  we acquired vaccine and antibody development rights from gsk to all ovarian cancer antigens whose discovery resulted from the original agreement 
in this related agreement we also acquired from gsk all cancer diagnostic rights and t cell adoptive cancer immunotherapy rights for all cancer antigens discovered by us in the breast  prostate  colon and ovarian cancer fields as well as for the her neu and mammaglobin antigens 
gsk has the right to terminate any of these agreements in the event of our material default of such agreement  or our bankruptcy or insolvency 
if we materially breach our original agreement with gsk  
table of contents gsk may as an alternative to terminating the agreement  continue its licenses with a reduction in the amounts owed to us as potential milestones and royalties 
under our original agreement  gsk also has the right for any reason with months prior notice to terminate its licenses in the breast  prostate and colon fields and for the her neu and mammaglobin antigens  although this termination right does not apply to the breast cancer vaccine candidate and prostate cancer vaccine candidate that gsk has licensed to us under one of the new agreements 
also under the original agreement  gsk has the right for any reason with months prior notice to terminate its licenses in the tuberculosis and chlamydia fields after august in addition  under our original agreement  if an acquisition of us results in a material breach of that agreement  gsk would have the right to terminate that agreement and we and any of our employees that remain employees of us or our acquiror would be precluded from working in any of the disease fields covered by our original agreement with gsk for years after such termination 
if we materially breach our new agreement for the development of a breast cancer vaccine candidate and prostate cancer vaccine candidate because of our failure to perform the development program  the rights to those vaccine candidates will revert to gsk and we will also be deemed to be in material breach of our new agreement under which we acquired from gsk the ovarian cancer rights and diagnostic and t cell product rights related to our cancer antigens that were included in our original agreement 
if gsk terminates our new agreement that covers ovarian cancer  diagnostics and t cell products  because of our material breach  all of the rights under that agreement will revert to gsk with the exception of any rights we may have granted to any third parties before the termination  and we will be required to pay gsk twice the amount of revenues we receive from those third parties as would have paid had the agreement not been terminated for our material breach 
as a result of our acquisition of coulter in  we acquired the collaboration agreement between coulter and gsk for the development and commercialization of bexxar therapy  for which we have completed phase iii clinical trials in the united states and which is the subject of a bla currently under review by the fda for the treatment of nhl 
under the agreement  as amended in april  gsk s territory was reduced to the united states and  following regulatory approval of bexxar therapy  gsk would be required to pay us a milestone payment 
under the agreement  gsk also provided to us a million credit line  which was fully drawn in december terms and conditions of the credit line are discussed further in footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on december  we presented data on bexxar therapy at an odac meeting 
odac agreed that the data from clinical trials of bexxar therapy provided substantial evidence of clinical benefit in rituximab refractory patients and clinical utility in chemotherapy refractory  low grade and follicular nhl  with or without transformation 
under the terms of the agreement  gsk has agreed to reimburse us for certain development costs and pay us for the achievement of certain defined clinical development  regulatory and sales milestones 
in  we recognized million for the reimbursement of clinical and other development costs from gsk 
we and gsk have agreed to co market bexxar in the united states and share revenue  cost of goods sold  sales and marketing costs and other costs associated with bexxar related activities 
currently  we share the pre launch cost of marketing associated with preparation of the potential commercialization of bexxar 
for  our share of these expenses was million and has been classified as sales  general and administrative expense 
we have several license and supply agreements with gsk  granting gsk licenses to certain adjuvants for use in vaccines for infectious diseases  cancers and allergies that gsk is developing 
these agreements grant gsk exclusive and co exclusive license rights depending on the disease field and territory 
under the terms of the agreements  gsk pays annual license fees  milestones  transfer payments and future royalty payments 
we have an outstanding loan from gsk in the amount of million  which amount  together with all accrued unpaid interest is due on september  at gsk s option  gsk may choose to receive 
table of contents the outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest in cash or shares of our common stock at an undisclosed premium to the then current fair market value of our common stock 
amounts receivable from gsk at december  and were million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and of our revenue resulted from collaborative agreements with gsk 
wyeth 
we have license and supply agreements with wyeth  granting wyeth licenses to certain adjuvants for use in vaccines for certain infectious disease fields that wyeth is developing 
these agreements grant wyeth exclusive and co exclusive license rights depending on the disease field and territory 
under the terms of the agreements  wyeth pays annual license fees  milestones  transfer payments and future royalty payments 
we recognized revenue of million   and  in  and  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately billion  of which million is attributable to the write off of acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  costs associated with our acquisitions and million is attributable to goodwill related charges 
we may incur substantial additional operating losses over the next several years 
such losses have been and may continue to be principally the result of various costs associated with our discovery  research and development programs and the purchase of technology 
as noted above  the funded research phase of certain of our collaborative agreements has expired and we may bear a larger portion of the related research program costs in the future 
additionally  as research programs progress from early stages into clinical development the costs continue to increase 
substantially all of our revenue to date has resulted from corporate partnerships  other research  development and licensing arrangements  research grants and interest income 
our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations depends in large part on entering into corporate partnerships for product discovery  research  development and commercialization  obtaining regulatory approvals for our products and successfully manufacturing and marketing our products once they are approved 
even if we are successful in the aforementioned activities our operations may not be profitable 
in addition  payments under corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements are subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount 
therefore  our operating results for any period may fluctuate significantly and may not be comparable to the operating results for any other period 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and revenue our revenue was million for  million in and million in the decrease compared with is primarily due to payments received in  including a million milestone payment for the achievement of certain clinical trial related milestones in connection with bexxar therapy from our collaborative agreement with gsk  million from our ex vivo agreement with idri and million related to the expiration of the research phase of our vaccine development collaborative agreement with gsk 
these decreases were partially offset by increased revenue of approximately million from our collaborative agreement with beaufour ipsen related to our proprietary anergix vaccine platform 
revenue includes a milestone payment of million from zambon for the filing of our ind for a lung cancer vaccine in the united states 
the increase compared to was primarily due to million of reimbursement revenue from our collaborative agreement for bexxar therapy with gsk  a million milestone payment for the achievement of certain clinical trial related milestones in connection with bexxar therapy from our collaborative agreement with gsk and million related to our agreement covering our psoriasis immunotherapeutic product  pvac treatment with medicis 
revenue includes million in milestone payments for the completion of our initial phase i ii clinical trial related to anergix 
ra and acceptance of the ind application related to pvac treatment for psoriasis 
revenue under government grants and contracts in was million  million in and million in we expect revenue to fluctuate in the future depending on our ability to enter into new 
table of contents collaboration agreements  timing and amounts of payments under our existing collaboration agreements and our ability to commercialize our potential products 
effective january   we changed our method of accounting for nonrefundable up front license fees based on the guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
expenses research and development expenses our research and development expenses were million for  million in and million in the decrease compared with is due primarily to a reduction in deferred compensation expense of million related to options assumed in the coulter acquisition  a reduction in the purchase of third party manufactured materials of million  payroll and personnel expenses of million related to our workforce reduction in south san francisco  and a decrease in clinical development activity of million  offset by an increase of million in facility expenses due in part to additional leased space in south san francisco 
we intend to offset south san francisco facilities cost through subleases in the future 
the increase compared with is due primarily to an increase of million related to the cost associated with our research and development activities in our south san francisco facility subsequent to the acquisition of coulter in december  million of deferred compensation expense related to options assumed in the coulter acquisition and the expense of raw material purchased in anticipation of regulatory approval in of million 
in accordance with our accounting policy regarding research and development expenses  we do not capitalize these costs prior to product approval 
we expect research and development expenses to increase or remain stable in the future as we continue to pursue our clinical and preclinical activities 
our research and development activities can be divided into research and preclinical programs and clinical development programs to treat cancer  infectious disease and autoimmune disease 
we estimate the costs associated with research and preclinical programs and clinical development programs approximate the following in millions research and preclinical programs clinical development programs total research and development because of the large number of research projects we have ongoing at any one time  and the ability to utilize resources across several projects  the majority of our research and development costs are not directly tied to any individual project and are allocated among multiple projects 
we manage our projects by reviewing scientific data and by supplementing this data with our cost allocations 
our cost allocations are based primarily on human resource time incurred on each project 
the costs allocated to a project as a result do not necessarily reflect the actual costs of the project 
accordingly  we do not maintain actual cost incurred information for our projects on a project by project basis 
costs attributed to research and preclinical projects largely represent our pipeline generating activities 
costs associated with clinical development programs represent the advancement of these activities into product candidates 
most of our product development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any approved products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to pass through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 
furthermore  as part of our business strategy  we may enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates and it is uncertain which of our product candidates would be subject to future collaborative 
table of contents arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate or it may delay the time and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report titled important factors that may affect our business  our results of operations and our stock price 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost 
we recorded deferred compensation of million associated with the coulter acquisition in  which represents the intrinsic value of the unearned options of coulter employees existing at the date of acquisition 
deferred compensation is being amortized on a graded vesting method over the remaining vesting period of the options 
we amortized million and million of deferred compensation to research and development expense in and  respectively 
we expect deferred compensation expense to decrease in and future years due to employee attrition  employee stock options vesting and the declining impact from using the graded vesting approach for calculating deferred compensation expense 
sales  general and administrative expenses our sales  general and administrative expenses were million for  million in and million in the decrease compared with was due primarily to reduced marketing and sales expenses of million related to our workforce reduction in south san francisco and a reduction in deferred compensation expense of million related to options assumed in the coulter merger 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in facility expenses of  due in part to additional leased space in south san francisco 
the increase compared with was primarily due to million related to the cost associated with our south san francisco facility subsequent to the acquisition of coulter in december we also recognized expense of million and million in and  respectively for our portion of pre launch marketing costs associated with bexxar therapy 
we expect sales  general and administrative expenses to increase in the future to support the expansion of our business activities as we expand our sales and marketing capabilities 
intangible amortization and goodwill impairment our intangible amortization expense was  for compared to million for and million for effective january   we adopted sfas  business combinations and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we will continue to amortize separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite useful lives 
as such  we will continue to amortize the acquired lease and adjuvant know how over their useful lives 
in accordance with the transition provision of sfas an evaluation of goodwill and other intangibles was done on january  and no indication of impairment existed at that time 
on march   we received a second complete review letter from the fda regarding our bla for bexxar therapy 
in the complete review letter  the fda stated that additional clinical studies will be required to provide sufficient evidence of the safety and net clinical benefit of bexxar therapy 
upon announcement on march  of the receipt of the complete review letter from the fda  the value of our common stock declined 
in management s opinion  the decline in our stock price represented an indication of impairment of recorded goodwill 
in accordance with sfas  an interim test of goodwill impairment was performed as of march  the impairment test involves a two step approach 
under step one of the test we compared our estimated fair value based upon the market price of our common stock to the carrying value of our equity 
because the carrying value of our equity exceeded our fair value  we performed step two of the test which involved allocating our fair value the reporting unit to all of our assets and liabilities to determine how much  if any  of the excess value should be allocated to goodwill 
the results 
table of contents of the impairment test indicated that no goodwill was present and accordingly  we recognized a million goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of acquired in process research and development we recorded ipr d expense of million in as a result of our december  acquisition of coulter 
we purchased coulter for approximately million  which consideration consisted of  shares of our common stock valued at million  assumed coulter stock options valued at million  less million associated with the intrinsic value of unvested options  and transaction costs of approximately million 
the million was recorded as deferred compensation and is being amortized as compensation expense over the remaining vesting periods of up to four years 
as a result of the acquisition  we recorded an acquired ipr d charge of million and acquisition related intangibles of million  which included goodwill of million  an assumed lease arrangement of million and an assembled workforce of million  which was subsequently reclassified to goodwill as a result of the adoption of sfas acquired ipr d for the above acquisition represents the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased technology  which  at the acquisition date  had not yet reached technological feasibility 
the cash flow projections for revenues were based on estimates of growth rates and the aggregate size of the respective markets for each product  probability of technical success given the stage of development at the time of acquisition  royalty rates based on prior licensing agreements  product sales cycles  and the estimated life of a product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses and income taxes were deducted from estimated revenue projections to arrive at estimated after tax cash flows 
projected operating expenses include general and administrative expenses  and research and development costs 
the rate utilized to discount projected cash flows ranged from to for in process technologies and was based primarily on venture capital rates of return and the weighted average cost of capital for us at the time of acquisition 
at the acquisition date  coulter s ipr d projects consisted of bexxar therapy  a radioisotope  iodine  or i  combined with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes and binds to the cd antigen  an antigen commonly expressed on the surface of b cells primarily during that stage of their life cycle when nhl arises  g  a monoclonal antibody that binds to sub unit one of the type i interferon receptor and neutralizes the activity of all type i interferons and may provide therapeutic benefit in a number of autoimmune diseases  including ra  systemic lupus erythematosus  crohn s disease  graft versus host disease and solid organ transplantation rejection and cpi  a tumor activated peptide  or tap  a proprietary molecule based on a peptide of four amino acids that is linked to doxorubicin 
cpi is designed to deliver significantly higher levels of doxorubicin to a tumor site relative to normal tissues 
doxorubicin  is an off patent chemotherapeutic drug that currently is used in treating a number of solid tumor cancers 
in the second quarter of we sold specific preclinical assets to medarex  inc  including g and cpi on december  we presented data on bexxar therapy  our most advanced product candidate  at an odac  meeting 
odac agreed that the data from clinical trials of bexxar therapy provided substantial evidence of clinical benefit in rituximab refractory patients and clinical utility in chemotherapy refractory  low grade and follicular nhl  with or without transformation 
the fda is not bound by odac s action  but often takes odac s recommendations into consideration when determining marketing approval of a new product 
the new prescription drug user fee act goal date for the fda to complete its review of all materials regarding bexxar therapy is may  we based all of the estimates and projections related to the ipr d projects for coulter on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time of each acquisition but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
if we do not successfully develop these projects  our business  operating results  and financial condition may be adversely affected 
as of the date of each acquisition  we concluded that once completed  the technologies under development can only be economically used for their specific and intended purposes and that such in process technologies have no alternative future use after taking into consideration the overall objectives of the project  progress toward the objectives  and uniqueness of developments to these objectives

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective january   we changed our method of accounting for nonrefundable up front license fees based on the guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements to recognize such fees over the term of the related research and development collaboration arrangement on a straight line basis  as this method best matches the effort provided 
the million cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  calculated as of january   was reported as a charge in the year ended december  the cumulative effect was initially recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue over the remaining term of the research and development collaboration agreements 
for the year ended december   the impact of the change in accounting was to increase net loss by million  or per share  comprised of the million cumulative effect of the change as described above per share less million of the deferred revenue related to the cumulative effect adjustment that was recognized as revenue during the year per share 
revenue includes million for and million for and that was previously recognized and included in the cumulative effect adjustment

the maximum amount of cash that would be paid in a year would be million and the maximum number of shares of common stock that would be issued is  during  we used million of cash in our operations  compared with million in and million in the decrease in cash used in operations from to is due primarily to the reduced workforce in our south san francisco operations

we believe that our existing capital resources  committed payments under our existing corporate partnerships  bank credit agreements  the cmi equity line facility  equipment financing and interest income will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations over at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  among others continued scientific progress in our discovery  research and product development programs  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the magnitude and scope of our discovery  research and development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  
table of contents the time and costs involved in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  and other factors not within our control 
in addition  we intend to seek additional funding through corporate partnerships  and also may seek additional funding through public or private equity financings  which could result in significant dilution to our stockholders  public or private debt financings  and additional capital lease transactions 
however  additional financing may be unavailable on acceptable terms  if at all 
if sufficient capital is not available  we may be forced to limit some or all of our research and development programs and related operations  curtail commercialization of our product candidates and  ultimately  cease operations 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or  fasb  issued statement no

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
all of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and  accordingly  are presented at fair value on our balance sheets 
we generally invest our excess cash in a rated or higher short to intermediate term fixed income securities and money market mutual funds 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
at december   we had long term obligations outstanding of approximately million 
our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of interest payments  principal payments  or a combination thereof 
the market value of our long term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates  increasing in periods of declining rates of interest  and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects on certain assets and liabilities based on hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates 
it is assumed the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks

table of contents important factors that may affect our businesses  our results of operations and our stock price 
we are at an early stage of product development and may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates 
we are at an early stage in the development of the majority of our therapeutic  prophylactic and diagnostic product candidates 
the development of safe and effective therapies for treating people with cancer  infectious diseases or autoimmune diseases is highly uncertain and subject to numerous risks 
product candidates that may appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality or may fail to achieve market acceptance 
we have not commercialized any products  other than melacine vaccine  our melanoma vaccine  which is approved for sale in canada  and an immunotherapeutic product that has been approved on a named patient basis in germany  spain  italy and the uk which product incorporates our mpl adjuvant  our proprietary adjuvant  added to the product to heighten the immune response to the product s antigens 
the fda is currently reviewing our bla for bexxar therapy  our most advanced product candidate 
on december  we presented data on bexxar therapy at an odac meeting 
odac agreed that the data from clinical trials of bexxar therapy provided substantial evidence of clinical benefit in rituximab refractory patients and clinical utility in chemotherapy refractory  low grade and follicular nhl  with or without transformation 
the fda is not bound by odac s action  but often takes odac s recommendations into consideration when determining marketing approval of a new product 
we may not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval for bexxar therapy or any of our other product candidates  or in commercializing these product candidates if approval is obtained 
our product candidates are subject to a government regulatory approval process that is uncertain  time consuming and expensive and may not result in any approved products 
any products that we develop are subject to regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
the regulatory process  which includes extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials of each product candidate in order to study its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
clinical trials of our product candidates may not demonstrate safety and efficacy to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for the indications being studied  if at all 
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
the failure to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of any of the product candidates by us could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product candidate 
the timing and completion of current and planned clinical trials of our product candidates depend on  among other factors  the rate at which patients are enrolled  which is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to the clinical sites  the number of clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study  
table of contents the existence of competing clinical trials  and the existence of alternative available products 
delays in patient enrollment in clinical trials may occur  which may result in increased costs  program delays or both 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
data from a phase iii clinical trial of melacine vaccine  with the primary endpoint being the comparison of disease free survival between patients with stage ii melanoma who  following surgical removal  received melacine vaccine versus observation only  showed no statistically significant difference in disease free survival of the eligible patient population 
recent discussions with the fda regarding the outcome of this trial have determined that approval of melacine vaccine in the united states will require an additional clinical trial 
in addition  we may encounter delays  or the fda may reject our product candidates  based on changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development  extension of the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or other factors beyond our control 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals would adversely affect the marketing of any products we develop  could impose significant additional costs on us  would diminish any competitive advantages that we may attain  and could adversely affect our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
for example  we filed our bla for bexxar therapy in june and almost three years later  we have not obtained regulatory approval for bexxar therapy 
we may not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval for bexxar therapy or any of our other product candidates  or in commercializing these product candidates if approval is obtained 
regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which the approved product may be marketed 
these limitations could reduce the size of the potential market for the product 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
further  manufacturers of approved products are subject to ongoing regulation  including compliance with fda regulations governing gmp 
failure to comply with manufacturing regulations can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
we have limited experience in manufacturing and may encounter problems or delays that could result in lost revenue 
our current manufacturing facilities may not be sufficient to support our needs for clinical quantities of our product candidates or commercial quantities of our current products 
we have no experience producing commercial quantities of any product  with the exception of limited experience producing melacine vaccine for sale in canada  and we have limited experience in producing clinical grade amounts of our proprietary immunotherapeutic products  including recombinant proteins or antibodies 
we currently manufacture only limited quantities of some antigens and several adjuvants 
if we are unable to manufacture our product candidates in accordance with clinical gmp regulations  the consequent lack of supply of the product candidates could delay our clinical programs or limit our sales of commercial products 
we intend to rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce larger quantities of recombinant protein or other cell culture based biologicals for clinical trials and product commercialization 
either we or our contract manufacturers may be unable to manufacture our proprietary antigen vaccines or other immunotherapeutic products at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable 
third party manufacturers also may be unable to meet our needs with respect to timing  quantity or quality 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of required products on acceptable terms  or if we encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with these manufacturers  our preclinical and clinical testing would be 
table of contents delayed  thereby delaying submission of products for regulatory approval  or the market introduction and commercial sale of the products 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current gmp regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if the facilities of those manufacturers cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda approval of our product candidates may be delayed or denied 
even if bexxar therapy receives fda approval  we may be unable to manufacture commercial quantities for sale 
bexxar therapy contains a radiolabeled antibody  which is an antibody linked to an isotope 
we have no existing internal capacity or experience with respect to manufacturing radiolabeled antibodies for large scale clinical trials or commercial purposes 
we have entered into an agreement with bi pharma kg to produce bulk tositumomab and fill the individual product vials with tositumomab 
we have contracted with bi pharma kg and a third party supplier for labeling and packaging services 
these manufacturers have limited experience producing  labeling and packaging tositumomab  and they may be unable to produce our requirements in commercial quantities or with acceptable quality 
we have entered into an agreement with nordion  for radiolabeling for united states supply the tositumomab component of bexxar therapy at nordion s centralized radiolabeling facility 
this agreement expires on may  we are actively negotiating with nordion to enter into a new agreement to radiolabel tositumomab 
if we are unable to finalize a new agreement with nordion on acceptable terms  we will need to secure a new source of radiolabeling 
although we are evaluating additional sources of radiolabeling  we may be unable to secure additional sources on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis  if at all 
under our agreement with amersham health  amersham health is responsible for radiolabeling the european supply of the tositumomab component of bexxar therapy 
neither nordion nor amersham health may be able to produce sufficient radiolabeled antibodies to meet our clinical requirements and  if bexxar therapy is approved and is successful in the market  our commercial requirements for the respective territories 
we are aware of only a limited number of manufacturers capable of producing tositumomab in commercial quantities or radiolabeling the antibody with the i radioisotope on a commercial scale 
to establish and qualify a new facility to centrally radiolabel antibodies could take three years or longer 
accordingly  if we are unable to reach a satisfactory agreement with nordion or to establish a new source of radiolabeling before the expiration of our existing agreement with nordion  our ability to market bexxar therapy in the united states could be harmed  if bexxar therapy is approved for sale in the united states at that time 
even if we reach a satisfactory agreement with nordion or another partner  nordion or that partner may be unable to produce our requirements in commercial quantities or with acceptable quality 
radiolabeled antibody cannot be stockpiled against future shortages due to the day half life of the i radioisotope 
accordingly  any interruption in supply from nordion or another supplier could harm our sales of bexxar therapy if and when it is approved for sale 
even if bexxar therapy receives fda approval  if we are unable to establish or maintain distribution capabilities  we may not successfully commercialize the product 
the unique properties of bexxar therapy require tightly controlled distribution of the product 
we may be unable to maintain or establish relationships with third parties or build in house distribution capabilities to meet requirements for north america 
if we are unable to establish or maintain these capabilities  we may not be able to successfully commercialize the product in north america 
due to its radioactive component  bexxar therapy is shipped in shielded containers and must arrive at its destination within hours of production 
bexxar therapy must also be temperature controlled during shipment 
we will rely on many third party suppliers to process orders and to package  store and ship bexxar therapy 
we are working with suppliers to minimize risk and loss of inventory and provide efficient service to customers in the event bexxar therapy is approved for commercial sale 
these third party suppliers may be unable to handle bexxar therapy in a manner that will minimize loss of or damage to inventory 

table of contents acceptance of bexxar therapy in the marketplace is uncertain and failure to achieve market acceptance will limit our potential revenue from sales of bexxar therapy 
if bexxar therapy is approved  it would require medical personnel to handle radioactive materials 
doctors may prefer to continue to treat nhl patients with conventional therapies  in this case chemotherapy and biologics 
further  oncologists and hematologists are not typically licensed to administer radioimmunotherapies such as bexxar therapy and will need to engage a nuclear medicine physician or receive specialty training to administer bexxar therapy 
nuclear regulatory commission regulations permit bexxar therapy to be administered on an outpatient basis in most cases that we currently contemplate 
market acceptance could  however  be adversely affected to the extent hospitals are required under applicable state  local or individual hospital regulations to administer bexxar therapy on an in patient basis 
because we have limited sale and distribution capabilities  we may be unable to successfully commercialize bexxar therapy or our other product candidates 
as a result of our reduction in force in may  we no longer have a direct sales force for the potential launch of bexxar therapy 
our ability to market and sell bexxar therapy  if approved  will be contingent upon recruiting  training and deploying the necessary sales force  as well as gsk s performance under our bexxar collaboration agreement 
developing an effective sales force will require a significant amount of our financial resources and time 
we may be unable to establish and manage an effective sales force in a timely or cost effective manner  if at all  and any sales force we do establish may not be capable of generating sales of bexxar therapy or other product candidates 
we intend to rely on our corporate partners to market our products outside the united states and  in the case of infectious and autoimmune disease products  worldwide 
our corporate partners may not have effective sales forces and distribution systems 
if we are unable to maintain or establish relationships and are required to market any of our products directly  we will need to build a sales and marketing force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities 
we may be unable to maintain or establish relationships with third parties or build in house sales and distribution capabilities 
if reimbursement is unavailable for our products  or if laws are adopted restricting the prices we may charge for our products  our revenues may be substantially reduced 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefit management companies  and other healthcare related organizations 
if reimbursement is not available for our products  demand for these products may be limited 
federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare 
existing regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals and other medical products may also change before any of our products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we may develop in the future 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products  including pharmaceuticals 
bexxar therapy faces particular uncertainties because third party payors have very little experience upon which to model pricing and reimbursement decisions 
further  if bexxar therapy is not administered in most cases on an outpatient basis  as is contemplated currently by us  the projected cost of the therapy will be higher than we anticipate 
our products 
table of contents may not be considered cost effective  and adequate third party reimbursement may be unavailable to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a return on our investment 
any claims relating to our improper handling  storage or disposal of hazardous materials could be time consuming and costly 
the manufacture and administration of bexxar therapy requires the handling  use and disposal of i isotope  a radioactive isotope of iodine 
these activities must comply with various state and federal regulations 
violations of these regulations could significantly delay completion of clinical trials and commercialization of bexxar therapy 
for our ongoing clinical trials and for commercial scale production  we currently rely on nordion to radiolabel the tositumomab with i radioisotope at a single location in canada 
violations of safety regulations could occur with nordion  and there is a risk of accidental contamination or injury 
in the event of any regulatory noncompliance or accident  the supply of radiolabeled tositumomab for use in clinical trials or commercial sales could be interrupted 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines  and this liability could exceed our resources 
we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations 
we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market  which could harm sales of the affected products 
if we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market  or if manufacturing problems occur  regulatory approval may be withdrawn  reformulation of our products  additional clinical trials  changes in labeling of our products or changes to or re approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required  sales of the affected products may drop significantly  our reputation in the marketplace may suffer  and lawsuits  including class action suits  may be brought against us 
any of the above occurrences could harm or prevent sales of the affected products or could increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing these products 
because we have limited sources of revenue  our results of operations are uncertain and may fluctuate significantly  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease 
to date  almost all of our revenue has resulted from payments made under agreements with our corporate partners  and we expect that most of our revenue will continue to result from corporate partnerships until approval and commercialization of products 
payments under corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements are subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amount 
we may not receive anticipated revenue under existing corporate partnerships  and we may be unable to enter into any additional corporate partnerships 
since our inception  we have generated only minimal revenue from diagnostic product sales and no significant revenue from therapeutic or prophylactic product sales 
with the exception of mpl adjuvant  which has been approved for sale as part of an immunotherapeutic product on a named patient basis in 
table of contents germany  spain  italy and the uk and melacine vaccine  which is available for sale in canada  we cannot predict when  if ever  our research and development programs will result in commercially available immunotherapeutic products 
we do not know when  if ever  we will receive any significant revenue from commercial sales of these products 
as a result of our limited sources of revenue  our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate 
because of these fluctuations  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful 
in addition  our operating results for a particular quarter or year may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could result in a decrease in our stock price 
we expect to incur future operating losses and may never achieve profitability 
we have experienced significant operating losses in each year since our inception on september  as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately billion  of which million is attributable to the write off of in process research and development costs associated with the acquisitions of four companies and of which million is attributable to goodwill related charges 
we may incur substantial additional operating losses over at least the next several years 
operating losses have been and may continue to be principally the result of the various costs associated with our acquisition activities  including the expenses associated with the write off of in process research and development  research and development programs  preclinical studies and clinical activities 
we may never achieve profitability  and our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations depends in large part on our ability to successfully enter into agreements with corporate partners for product discovery  research  development and commercialization  obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and manufacture and market our products once they are approved for sale 
even if we are successful in the above activities  our operations may not be profitable 
we will need additional capital  and our ability to implement our existing financing plans and secure additional funding is uncertain 
we may be unable to raise on acceptable terms  if at all  the substantial capital resources necessary to conduct our operations 
if we are unable to raise the required capital  we may be forced to limit some or all of our research and development programs and related operations  curtail commercialization of our product candidates and  ultimately  cease operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in our discovery and research programs  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the magnitude and scope of our discovery  research and development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  the potential costs of building and maintaining a marketing and sales force  
table of contents the potential costs of marketing a product  and other factors beyond our control 
we have in place a million equity line facility with cmi  of which we have drawn down million 
however  cmi is not obligated to purchase shares of our common stock unless a number of conditions have been satisfied 
first  cmi generally has no obligation to purchase shares to the extent that the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the specified valuation period following the exercise of our right to sell shares to cmi under the equity line facility is below per share 
in the future the price of our common stock may not meet this minimum trading price condition to enable us to draw down funds under the equity line facility 
second  cmi is only obligated at any given request to purchase shares in a minimum aggregate amount of  and in a maximum aggregate amount of million 
furthermore  cmi has no obligation to purchase shares on a given day if our daily trading volume falls below a specified minimum 
finally  on trading days where the common stock is not listed and approved for trading on the principal trading exchange of our common stock or where trading is restricted  we might not have the right to sell any shares to cmi 
in addition to any funds available under the cmi equity line facility  we intend to seek additional funding through corporate partnerships  and also may seek additional funding through public or private equity financings  public or private debt financings  and capital lease transactions 
we believe that our existing capital resources  committed payments under existing corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  bank credit arrangements  the cmi equity line facility  proceeds of our recent private placement of equity securities with certain institutional and other accredited investors equipment financing and interest income will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations over at least the next months 
however  a substantial number of the payments to be made by our corporate partners and other licensors depend on us achieving development and regulatory milestones 
failure to achieve these milestones may reduce the period during which we will be able to fund operations without additional capital resources 
our equity line facility and other transactions may result in dilution and a decline in the price of our common stock 
under the equity line facility with cmi  we may  subject to certain conditions  sell to cmi up to an additional million of our common stock from time to time before december  the number of shares and price per share will depend on the market price and trading volume of the shares during the applicable one to twenty day draw down period for any sale 
the sale of shares pursuant to the equity line facility will have a dilutive effect on the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders 
subsequent sales of these shares in the open market by cmi may also have the effect of lowering our stock price  thereby increasing the number of shares issuable under the equity line facility should we choose to sell additional shares to cmi and consequently further diluting our outstanding shares 
these sales could have an immediate adverse effect on the market price of the shares and could result in dilution to the holders of our shares 
in the event that we draw down the remaining maximum amount of approximately  shares under the facility  and issue the additional  shares subject to warrants issued to the placement agent in connection with the facility  these shares would represent approximately of our currently outstanding shares 
the perceived risk associated with the possible sale of a large number of shares issued under the equity line facility at prices as low as per share  which is of the floor share price at which cmi has agreed to purchase our shares  could cause some of our stockholders to sell their stock  thus causing the price of our stock to decline 
in addition  actual or anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or 
table of contents anticipated sales of stock under the equity line facility could cause some institutions or individuals to engage in short sales of our common stock  which may itself cause the price of our stock to decline 
in august  as part of a private placement of approximately million shares of our common stock  we also issued warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share to selected institutional and other accredited investors 
if these warrants are exercised  the issuance of shares of common stock will have a dilutive effect on the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders 
in addition to any dilution resulting from issuances under the equity line facility or upon exercise of warrants  we are also obligated  or in some cases have the option  to issue additional shares of our common stock under collaboration and other strategic agreements 
under a loan agreement with gsk  at our option  we may choose to pay the outstanding principal amount of million which is due in october  together with all accrued unpaid interest thereon  in cash or shares of our common stock valued at the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day preceding the payment date to gsk 
in addition  under a collaborative agreement with gsk  we have an outstanding loan in the amount of million  which is due in september at gsk s option  gsk may choose to receive the outstanding principal and accrued unpaid interest in cash or shares of our common stock at an undisclosed premium to the then current fair market value of our common stock 
on december   we sold  shares of our common stock to amersham health for a total purchase price of million in cash 
this sale was made pursuant to a previously disclosed october agreement with amersham health 
under the terms of the agreement  at our option  we have the ability to sell an additional million of shares to amersham health at fair market value  which is determined according to the average of the closing price of our common stock over a specified period surrounding the date of issuance 
this option expires on april  under a license assignment agreement between coulter  beckman coulter  inc  interwest partners v  lp and interwest investors v  relating to portions of the technology underlying bexxar therapy  beckman coulter  inc is entitled to receive royalties upon commercial sale of bexxar therapy  if any  derived from the licenses that were assigned to coulter 
for the first million of royalties  beckman coulter  inc has the option  in lieu of receiving cash  to receive shares of our common stock valued at the then current fair market value of our common stock 
we are also required to pay dividends on our outstanding preferred stock 
the dividend can be paid in cash or common stock  at our option 
the maximum amount of cash that would be paid in a year would be million and the maximum number of shares of common stock that would be issued is if we issue additional stock under these agreements  as dividends on our preferred stock or pursuant to other transactions  it will have a dilutive effect on the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders 
although from time to time  we expect to enter into new partnerships  acquisitions and other strategic transactions in which we may agree to issue additional common stock  we have no present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to such additional transactions 
transactions by cmi may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
from time to time  within limitations specified in the cmi equity line facility and subject to applicable laws  cmi may engage in short sales  short sales against the box  puts and calls and other transactions in our common stock  and may sell and deliver shares of our common stock issued under the equity line facility in connection with these transactions 
if cmi engages in such transactions  the result will be advance sales of additional shares into the market for our common stock  which could create downward pressure on our stock price 

table of contents if our corporate partnerships are unsuccessful or if we are unable to establish corporate partnerships in the future  our revenue growth and product development may be limited 
the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to enter into multiple corporate partnerships and to manage effectively the numerous relationships that may result from this strategy 
we recognized of our revenue from research and development and other funding under our existing corporate partnerships for the years ended december   and december  if our corporate partnerships are unsuccessful or if we are unable to establish corporate partnerships  we may be prevented from commercializing our product candidates or effectively partnering our product candidates 
our licenses  in combination with our proprietary discoveries  enable us to enter into partnerships to progress some of our product candidates 
our corporate partnerships generally provide our partners with the right to use technologies owned or licensed by us in research  development and commercialization activities 
our material corporate partnerships include the following a corporate partnership with gsk to develop and commercialize bexxar therapy in the united states  a corporate partnership with amersham health to develop and commercialize bexxar therapy in europe  a development  commercialization and license agreement with medicis related to our candidate psoriasis immunotherapeutic product  pvac treatment  a development and license agreement with zenyaku kogyo co 
ltd 
related to pvac treatment  a corporate partnership with kirin for the research  development and commercialization of vaccine products aimed at treating multiple forms of cancer  including leukemia  myelodysplasia and melanoma  a corporate partnership with zambon for the research  development and commercialization of vaccine products aimed at preventing and or treating lung cancer  and a corporate partnership with gsk that provides for vaccine development of breast  prostate and colon cancer vaccines  and vaccine discovery and development programs  for two chronic infectious pathogens  chlamydia and tuberculosis 
management of our relationships with our corporate partners requires significant time and effort from our management team  coordination of our research with the research priorities of our corporate partners  effective allocation of our resources to multiple projects  and an ability to attract and retain key management  scientific and other personnel 
our corporate partners may terminate our current partnerships 
our agreements with gsk for commercialization of bexxar therapy in the united states  amersham health for marketing bexxar therapy in europe and medicis for commercialization of pvac treatment contain milestone based termination provisions  which provide that if we fail to meet specified development or regulatory milestones  the licensor may terminate the agreement 
for example  gsk may terminate the agreement for commercialization of bexxar therapy at any time because bexxar therapy did not receive fda approval before june  in addition  all of these license agreements may be terminated by the licensor for our material breach or insolvency  or after a specified termination date 
some of our corporate partners have options to license aspects of our technology 
any of these corporate partners may not exercise its option to license this technology 
the process of establishing new corporate partnerships is difficult and time consuming 
our discussions with potential partners may not lead to the establishment of new corporate partnerships on favorable terms  if 
table of contents at all 
if we successfully establish new corporate partnerships  such partnerships may never result in the successful development of our product candidates or the generation of significant revenue 
because we generally enter into research and development collaborations with corporate partners at an early stage of product development  our success largely depends on the performance of our corporate partners 
we do not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by our corporate partners to collaborative activities 
our corporate partners may not commit sufficient resources to our research and development programs or the commercialization of our products and product candidates 
if any corporate partner fails to commit sufficient resources  our preclinical or clinical development related to the corporate partnership could be delayed or terminated 
also  our current corporate partners or future corporate partners  if any  may pursue existing or other development stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
our inability to license technology from third parties or our inability to maintain exclusive licenses may impair our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
our success also depends on our ability to enter into and maintain licensing arrangements with commercial or academic entities to obtain technology that is advantageous or necessary to developing and commercializing our product candidates 
if we cannot obtain or maintain these licenses on acceptable terms  we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or in license similar technology 
if we are unable to do so  we may be prevented from developing and commercializing our product candidates 
we currently have various license agreements that provide us rights to use technologies owned or licensed by third parties in research  development and commercialization activities 
our material third party licensing arrangements include the following a license with the dana farber cancer institute for the use of the anti b antibody used in bexxar therapy  and a license with the university of michigan for the use of bexxar therapy 
many of our third party license agreements contain milestone based termination provisions  in which case our failure to meet any agreed milestones may allow the licensor to terminate the agreement 
further  we may be unable to negotiate additional license agreements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
many of our license agreements grant us exclusive licenses to the underlying technologies 
if we are unable to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive licenses we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates 
if we are unable to obtain  protect and enforce our patent rights  we may be unable to effectively protect or exploit our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain  protect and enforce commercially valuable patents 
if we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements  our competitors could develop and commercialize products that would otherwise infringe our patents 
we try to protect our proprietary positions by filing united states and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to developing our business 
our patent position is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
legal standards relating to the validity and scope of claims in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical fields are still evolving 
accordingly  the degree of future protection for our patent rights is uncertain 
the risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents include the following the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents  the claims of any patents that issue may not provide meaningful protection  we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  the patents licensed or issued to us may not provide a competitive advantage  
table of contents other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us  disputes may arise regarding the invention and corresponding ownership rights in inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us  our licensors  corporate partners and other scientific collaborators  and other companies may design around our patented technologies 
we have licensed several patent applications from sri related to our microsphere encapsulation technology 
one of these patent applications is currently the subject of opposition proceedings before the european patent office 
the european patent office has revoked the previously issued european patent 
although sri has appealed this decision  it is uncertain whether sri will prevail in this opposition proceeding 
as a result  this patent may not issue in europe 
idec has challenged the validity of several of our patents related to bexxar therapy by seeking declaratory judgment of invalidity of these patents 
idec is also seeking a declaratory judgment that its zevalin product for the treatment of nhl is not infringing the patents 
we  gsk  our collaboration partner for bexxar therapy in the united states  and the regents of the university of michigan are parties to a lawsuit against idec alleging patent infringement of certain of our patents by zevalin and seeking monetary damages and permanent injunctive relief 
claims in the patents at issue in the litigation cover composition of matter and methods of use in the treatment of nhl 
if idec is successful in these proceedings  idec would be able to market its zevalin product without the need to license from us any of our patents 
an unfavorable outcome of this matter could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results from the sale of bexxar therapy  if it is approved 
if we are unable to gain access to patent and proprietary rights of others  we may be unable to compete effectively 
our success depends in part on our ability to gain access to third party patent and proprietary rights and to operate our business without infringing on third party patent rights 
we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from third parties to develop  manufacture and commercialize our product candidates 
licenses required under third party patents or proprietary rights may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we do not obtain the required licenses  we could encounter delays in product development while we attempt to redesign products or methods or we could be unable to develop  manufacture or sell products requiring these licenses 
if we are unable to protect our trade secrets  we may be unable to protect our interests in proprietary know how that is not patentable or for which we have elected not to seek patent protection 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect trade secrets that are not patentable or for which we have elected not to seek patent protection 
to protect our trade secrets  we rely primarily on confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties  and protective contractual provisions such as those contained in license agreements and research agreements 
nevertheless  other companies may develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies that are not protected by patents  or otherwise obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
other parties may breach confidentiality agreements and other protective contracts we have entered into  and we may not become aware of  or have adequate remedies in the event of  any breach 
any material leak of confidential data into the public domain or to third parties could harm our competitive position 
if we are unable to protect our trademarks  we may be unable to compete effectively 
we try to protect our trademarks by applying for united states and foreign registrations for marks that are important to developing our business 
however  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  and effective trademark protection may not be available in other jurisdictions 
if we are unable to protect our trademarks  we may be unable to establish brand awareness for our products  which could limit our ability to compete effectively 
of our 
table of contents trademarks  mpl adjuvant is currently the subject of an opposition proceeding before the office for the harmonization in the internal market  which handles initial prosecution and opposition of european trademarks 
we may not ultimately prevail in this opposition proceeding 
as a result  we may not receive trademark protection for mpl adjuvant in europe 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights owned or used by us may be costly and time consuming 
as a result of litigation  interferences  opposition proceedings and other administrative proceedings in which we are or may become involved  including the idec litigation  we may incur substantial expense and the proceedings may divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in proceedings of this type could subject us to significant liabilities  allow our competitors to market competitive products without obtaining a license from us  or require us to seek licenses from third parties that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if we cannot obtain such licenses  we may be restricted or prevented from developing and commercializing our product candidates 
the enforcement  defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights  united states patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and elsewhere involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  these proceedings are costly and time consuming  and their outcome is uncertain 
litigation may be necessary to assert claims of infringement  enforce our issued and licensed patents  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
if we do not successfully integrate potential future acquisitions  we may incur unexpected costs and disruptions to our business 
we have completed several acquisitions of complementary technologies  product candidates and businesses 
in the future  we may acquire additional complementary companies  products and product candidates or technologies 
managing these acquisitions has entailed and may in the future entail numerous operational and financial risks and strains  including exposure to unknown liabilities  higher than expected acquisition and integration costs  difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of acquired businesses with our operations and personnel  disruption of our business and diversion of our management s time and attention to integrating or completing the development or commercialization of any acquired technologies  impairment of relationships with key customers of acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership  inability to retain key employees of acquired businesses  and increased amortization expenses if an acquisition results in significant intangible assets or potential write downs of goodwill and other intangible assets due to impairment of the assets 
for example  in december we acquired coulter  a publicly held biotechnology company specializing in  among other things  the development of therapeutic antibodies  including bexxar therapy 
as a result of our acquisition of coulter  we acquired direct sales and marketing personnel in preparation for the launch of bexxar therapy 
in an effort to minimize expenses during the delay in the fda review of bexxar therapy  we initiated expense reductions  including a reduction in total headcount in march the majority of these reductions took place in the operations that we acquired from coulter 
during the first 
table of contents quarter of we experienced a decrease in the value of our common stock subsequent to receiving the complete review letter from the fda regarding the bexxar bla 
as a result  goodwill and other intangibles were re evaluated and we recognized a million goodwill impairment charge 
regulatory approval by the fda for bexxar therapy may be further delayed or rejected  in which case we may not gain substantial benefit from the coulter acquisition 
in may  we sold specific preclinical assets and equipment that we acquired from coulter to medarex  inc and  in connection with the asset sale  initiated a further headcount reduction 
we depend heavily on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  the loss of any of whom could impair our ability to compete 
the loss of the services of any of the principal members of our management and scientific staff could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our scientific or business objectives 
competition among biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies for qualified employees is intense  and the ability to retain and attract qualified individuals is critical to our success 
we may be unable to attract and retain these individuals currently or in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers  employees or consultants 
we also have relationships with scientific collaborators at academic and other institutions  some of whom conduct research at our request or assist us in formulating our research  development or clinical strategy 
these scientific collaborators are not our employees and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
we have limited control over the activities of these scientific collaborators and can generally expect these individuals to devote only limited amounts of time to our activities 
failure of any of these persons to devote sufficient time and resources to our programs could harm our business 
in addition  these collaborators may have arrangements with other companies to assist the companies in developing technologies that may compete with our products 
if we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries  our business will fail 
the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive  and we may be unable to compete effectively in these industries 
many companies and institutions compete with us in developing alternative therapies to treat or prevent cancer  infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases  including pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  academic institutions  and research organizations 
moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors  thereby preventing us from obtaining technology on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical development  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we do 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research and development  manufacturing  and preclinical and clinical development  and obtain regulatory approval and market of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and 
table of contents retaining qualified scientific and management personnel  as well as in acquiring and developing technologies complementary to our programs 
we will face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety  timing and scope of regulatory approvals  availability of resources  reimbursement coverage  product price  and patent position 
competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products  or may achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization  than we do 
these competitive products may achieve a greater market share or render our products obsolete 
idec s product  zevalin  received fda approval for commercial sale in the united states in february zevalin has been approved and is being marketed for the treatment of nhl in the united states  the indication for which we are seeking approval to sell bexxar therapy in the united states 
consequently  idec could have a significant advantage over us in sales and marketing of products for the treatment of nhl in the united states 
our stock price could be very volatile and your shares may suffer a decline in value 
the market prices for securities of biotechnology companies have in the past been  and are likely to continue in the future to be  very volatile 
as a result of the fluctuations in the price of our common stock you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial volatility depending on numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  including announcements regarding the results of discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors  progress or delay of our or our competitors regulatory approvals  announcements regarding the acquisition of technologies or companies by us or our competitors  changes in our existing corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements  establishment of additional corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements by us or our competitors  technological innovations or new commercial products developed by us or our competitors  changes in our or our competitors intellectual property portfolio  developments or disputes concerning our or our competitors proprietary rights  issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports and their recommendations regarding us or our competitors  changes in government regulations  economic and other external factors  additions or departures of any of our key personnel  operating losses by us  and actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results and degree of trading liquidity in our common stock 

table of contents our common stock has traded as high as and as low as since the beginning of the last reported sales price of our common stock on december  was 
if our stock price declines significantly  we may be unable to raise additional capital 
significant declines in the price of our common stock could also impede our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and reduce the liquidity of our common stock 
product liability claims may damage our reputation and if insurance proves inadequate the product liability claims may harm our financial position 
our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims inherent in manufacturing  testing and marketing therapies for treating people with cancer  infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases 
a product liability claim may damage our reputation by raising questions about a product s safety and efficacy and could limit our ability to sell one or more products by preventing or interfering with product commercialization 
although we have product liability and clinical trial liability insurance that we believe is commercially reasonable  this coverage may be inadequate or may be unavailable in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
defending a suit  regardless of its merit  could be costly and could divert management attention 
state laws and our certificate of incorporation may inhibit potential acquisition bids that could be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware and washington law  will make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial for our stockholders 
this could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our shares of common stock 
for example  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws allow our board to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders  eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting  eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors  specify a supermajority requirement for stockholders to call a special meeting  specify restrictive procedures for director nominations by stockholders  and specify a supermajority requirement for stockholders to change the number of directors 
we are subject to certain provisions of delaware and washington law  which could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
in particular  section of the delaware general corporation law prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in certain business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless specific conditions are met 
similarly  chapter b 
of the washington business corporation act prohibits corporations based in washington from engaging in certain business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of five years unless specific conditions are met 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware and washington law could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock 
the provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock
