critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
see note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
general the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to special charges  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and contingencies related to litigation and environmental matters 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
special charges the company recorded special charges  net of adjustments  of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these charges and adjustments were made in connection with detailed repositioning and restructuring plans  which provided for a series of cost reduction initiatives to further streamline operations  strengthen the company s competitive position and provide a platform for future growth 
the charges associated with these plans included estimates for amounts related to asset impairments  employee severance costs  plant closure and related environmental costs and the settlements of various contractual obligations resulting from these repositioning and restructuring actions 
when it is determinable that the actual costs differ from the original estimates  adjustments  either additional charges or reversals  are made to the remaining special charge reserves at that time 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets the company evaluates long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  annually or when events occur or circumstances change that may result in a potential impairment 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of acquired businesses 
if impairment indicators are present  the company is required to assess the recoverability of these assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust the impairment charges for these assets 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the statement also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million 
at december  and  management determined that it is more likely than not that million and million  respectively  of certain deferred tax assets will not be realized  requiring the company to establish a valuation allowance for those amounts 
the company evaluates on a quarterly basis its ability to realize its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to support realization of certain deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income might affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include  but are not limited to  increased competition  general economic conditions  a decline in sales or earnings  loss of market share or delays in product availability 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
defined benefit pension plans the company sponsors various non contributory and contributory defined benefit pension plans which have significant pension benefit costs developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rates of increases in compensation levels 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns in determining these assumptions 
at october  the annual plan measurement date  appropriate changes were made in the discount rates and expected return on plan assets assumptions for all plans 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for detail of these assumptions 
the company currently expects pension costs to increase approximately million to million in compared to the company has no funding requirements for as actuarially determined for the us plans 
the company does expect  however  to make a voluntary contribution to the us qualified plan of approximately million 
it is anticipated that this contribution will consist primarily of company stock 
company contributions to the non us plans in are expected to be approximately million  in line with amounts 
an increase in either the discount rate or expected return on plan assets of one fourth of percentage point  holding all other assumptions constant  would decrease the company s pension expense by million and million  respectively 
correspondingly  a decrease in these assumptions of one fourth of percentage point  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase the company s pension expense by million and million  respectively 
contingencies the company is subject to legal proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the company records a reserve when management considers the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome probable and when a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made 
at december   the company had accrued million and million related to litigation and environmental liabilities  respectively 
these accruals are estimates and may change in the future as new developments arise as changes are made in settlement strategy

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and natural gas prices that could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operations and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  by using derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
the derivative financial instruments generally used include swaps  forward contracts and options 
the derivative financial instruments utilized by the company in its hedging activities are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes 
in addition  derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to limit the exposure of nonperformance on such instruments 
international operations  including us export sales  constitute a significant portion of the company s revenues and identifiable assets 
these operations result in a large volume of foreign currency commitment and transaction exposures and foreign currency net asset exposures 
at december  and  the company s primary net foreign currency market exposures were dispersed through various countries and primarily included the euro and its legacy currencies  the british pound and the japanese yen 
exposure to variability in currency exchange rates is mitigated  when possible  through the use of natural hedges  whereby purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity dates offset one another 
the amount of hedging activity and management of commitment and transaction exposures is coordinated at the corporate level 
hedges are set to mature concurrently with the estimated timing of settlement of the underlying transactions 
considering the company s operating profile  at december   the result of a uniform change in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would result in a change in operating income of approximately million 
a similar change in would have had approximately a million effect on operating income 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar  and does not factor in any potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices that may result from changes in exchange rates 
the company uses commercial paper as a source of financing  which exposes the company to changes in short term interest rates 
the company manages its ratio of fixed to floating rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
to manage this mix in a cost effective manner  the company  from time to time  enters into interest rate swap agreements in which it agrees to exchange various combinations of fixed and or variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts that are supported by the company s current debt position 
in the first quarter of  the company entered into fixed to variable interest rate swaps to manage interest expense on million of fixed rate debt 
no interest rate swaps were in place during based on the company s debt position at december   a hypothetical change in interest rates of percentage point for a one year period would change income loss from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million 
this analysis does not consider any effect that a change in interest rates would have on overall economic activity or management actions to mitigate interest rate changes 
as of december   the company had investments of million representing investment securities with maturities of three months or less 
a hypothetical change in interest rates of percentage point earned on these deposits for a one year period would change income before income taxes by million 
since the second quarter of  as part of its risk management strategy  the company has entered into fixed price swap and option contracts  including caps and floors  to manage its exposure to changes in natural gas prices 
these natural gas contracts obligate the company to make or receive a payment equal to the net change in the value of the contracts at their maturity 
such contracts are designated as hedges of the company s forecasted purchases through and are effective in hedging the company s exposure to changes in natural gas prices during this period 
the natural gas contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses deferred through other comprehensive income loss and recognized in earnings when realized as an adjustment to cost of products sold 
the fair value of these contracts at december  was immaterial to the company s consolidated financial position 
based on the company s natural gas exposure at december   a hypothetical change in natural gas prices for a one year period would change income before income taxes by approximately million
