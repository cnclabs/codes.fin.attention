item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis below contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements including statements regarding anticipated future sales  margin and expense levels  future tax rates  future cash flow and working capital requirements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors set forth under factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
all references to years are to fiscal years unless otherwise noted 
results of operations sales sales in increased to million from million in sales by our safety products group increased over this was the result of increased unit sales as well as the full year effect of sales by dunn sales  inc  which was acquired in june the full year effect of sales by dsi accounted for of the growth in sales by the safety products group 
the automation products group continued to be negatively impacted by economic conditions in the semiconductor industry and as a result reported a decline in its sales 
sales in declined to million from million recorded in unit shipments of both the safety and automation products groups were negatively impacted by the economic downturn in the first half of and the economic impact of the events of september the safety products group s lower sales were partially offset by the sales associated with dunn sales 
the company is organized into two product groups the safety products group spg and the automation products group apg 
group sales for the years ended december   and were spg apg the table below summarizes operating costs and expenses as a percentage of sales for the most recent three years 
sales gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangibles total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss gross profit million million million increase in decrease in our gross margin was of sales in  of sales in and of sales in as a result of the higher level of shipments in  which reflected less fixed cost per unit  our gross profit increased over our gross profit declined in from while we experienced sales declines in all of our product lines during  higher margin products suffered proportionately greater losses than our lower margin products 
also in  reduced factory activity resulted in underabsorbed manufacturing overhead 
gross margin in was positively influenced by the addition of psi tronix s products  which carry a relatively lower cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses million million million change in increase in as a result of the cost reduction measures initiated in and continued in  we were able to keep our selling  general and administrative expenses at levels in absolute dollars in spite of a increase in sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses were and of sales in and compared to of sales in total selling  general and administrative expenses were higher in due to increased costs associated with the dsi operations and bad debt expense resulting from the failure of two of our distributors 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in the foreseeable future but may fluctuate as a percentage of sales 
research and development expenses million million million decrease in increase in product creation  development and enhancement have always been and continue to be an important factor in our long term success 
investments in this area enable us to serve the factory automation market with increasingly sophisticated sensors and manufacturing control products 
as a result of the above mentioned cost reduction measures and a lowering of our reliance on outside contractors  we were able to reduce our research and development expenditures by from the level 
during  we made a concerted effort to maintain our research and development efforts in spite of the reduced revenue and profit levels we experienced in that year 
during  we increased our development efforts with the acquisition of psi tronix 
in and  we introduced a number of new products and product enhancements 
consistent with our dedication to the development of new products  we anticipate that the level of research and development expenses will increase in the future  although such expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of sales 
to date  all product development costs have been expensed as incurred 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and as a result of the losses sustained in  we recorded an income tax benefit of of the loss for the year 
we expect that our effective tax rate for will be reasonably consistent with and see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital needs have been met through funds generated from operating activities 
during  operating funds were provided by net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization  increased accounts payable and accrued expenses and decreased inventories 
these operating funds were used to offset increases in accounts receivable and for the acquisition of fixed assets 
working capital amounted to million at december   a increase from the million at december  the bank line of credit of million was renewed in and extended to june  we have the option to convert up to million of the credit line into a five year term note 
secured by qualified receivables  fixed assets and inventories  borrowing under this credit line bears interest at the bank s prime rate 
at december   none of the line of credit had been utilized 
we made certain capital expenditures during  primarily for production  quality assurance  research and development equipment  information systems and software 
consistent with our operations historically and our current plans for growth  we plan to make additional capital expenditures during  primarily for production  quality assurance and research and development equipment 
while we had no formal commitments at december   it is anticipated that capital expenditures in will be in excess of million  predicated on our profitability and cash resources 
we believe that cash flow from operations and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital requirements through at least while we continue to evaluate financing alternatives from time to time  we have no current plans to raise additional outside capital 
at december   future minimum payments under our leases due in the years through were approximately     and  respectively 
relationship with parent intercompany transactions between us and our parent company include charges by our parent for management services provided to us  dividend payments to our parent and other cash transfers 
our parent files a consolidated tax return including our accounts 
our tax provision or benefit is calculated on a stand alone basis 
our income taxes payable or receivable calculated on that basis are paid to or received from our parent 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenue from product sales to customers is recognized upon shipment if a signed purchase order exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable and product returns can be reasonably estimated 
subsequent to the sale of the products  we have no obligation to provide any modification or customization  upgrades  enhancements or postcontract customer support 
upon shipment  we provide for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties 
we estimate sales returns and warranty costs based on historical experience and the best information we have at the time we report our financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
installation and engineering service revenue is recognized when services are rendered  or an identifiable portion of the contract is completed  no significant post delivery obligations exist and collection is probable 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our historical consumption and our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
as demonstrated during  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
in addition  our industry is characterized by technological change  new product development  and product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have misstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we had in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our customers could have an adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets  such as fixed assets  goodwill  intangible assets and investments  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value 
the measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long termed assets 
factors that may affect future results because of the variety of factors and uncertainties affecting our operating results  past financial performance and historical trends may not be a reliable indicator of future performance 
these factors  as well as other factors affecting our operating performance  may result in significant volatility in our common stock price 
among the factors which could affect our future business  financial condition or operating results are the following our operating results may fluctuate we have experienced fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results and anticipate that these fluctuations will continue 
these fluctuations are caused by a number of factors  including the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in complementary third party products with which our products are sold  the mix of products sold and the timing of operating expenditures 
our operating results are also negatively impacted by generally adverse economic conditions throughout the high technology sector 
in particular  our psi tronix subsidiary continues to experience low sales volume due to the recent market conditions in the semiconductor industry 
the seasonality inherent in our business could cause our operating results to fluctuate the industrial manufacturing equipment industry in which we compete has historically been subject to seasonality 
this is also true with respect to european markets in which we compete where business activity declines due to vacations taken in the summer months 
this seasonality  combined with other factors such as the variability in our operating results described above  renders quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations unreliable as indicia of our overall performance 
the market for our products is highly competitive the market for industrial sensors is highly competitive 
many competitors have substantially greater name recognition and technical  marketing and financial resources than we have 
competitive pressures could reduce market acceptance of our products and result in price reductions  decreased revenues and increases in expenses 
our business could suffer if we do not respond to technological change and new product development demands of our customers the market for our products is characterized by changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and new product introductions 
our future success will depend on our ability to respond to emerging industry standards  enhance current products  develop new products  and achieve market acceptance of those products  all on a timely and cost effective basis 
the introduction of new products also requires that we manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption of customer orders  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demands 
our sales are dependent on independent distributors 
a majority of our sales are through third party distributors  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers 
these resellers are not required to offer our products exclusively 
we cannot assure you that a reseller will continue to offer our products 
in addition many of our resellers are privately owned firms which may not be well capitalized  as was demonstrated by the failure of two of our distributors during if our ability to sell products through these third parties is impaired  our results of operations would likely suffer 
our international sales are subject to risks our international sales may be disrupted by currency fluctuations or other events beyond our control  including political or regulatory changes 
if our international sales were disrupted for any reason  our revenue levels would decline 
our business could suffer if we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products and services 
there can be no assurance that our patents  trademarks  or contractual arrangements or other steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will prove sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or defer independent third party development of similar technologies 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the technology licenses granted to us from our parent company will continue to be available 
the loss of any of our proprietary technology could require us to obtain technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products  services or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
our operations may be negatively impacted as a result of deteriorating global economic and political conditions 
our business may suffer as a result of general economic and political conditions in the us and abroad 
over the past two years  there has been a rapid and severe downturn in the us market and global economy 
we expect that this negative trend will continue  however  the duration and future severity are uncertain 
this uncertainty has significantly increased due to recent terrorist activity  such as the attacks in the us on september   and the recent military activity in afghanistan  iraq and the middle east 
additional terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage or disruption to us or to our suppliers and our customers 
fears of global recession  war  and terrorism may continue to have seriously detrimental effects on the us and global economies 
such conditions could further dampen consumer confidence and cause our customers to slow or cease spending on our products 
if these events continue  our operations may be negatively impacted
