item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of results of operations and financial condition is based upon  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto included under item of this report 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this annual report contain forward looking statements relating to future results of the company 
such forward looking statements are identified by use of forward looking words such as anticipates  believes  plans  estimates  expects  and intends or words or phrases of similar expression 
these forward looking statements are subject to various assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  changes in political and economic conditions  demand for the company s products  acceptance of new products  technology developments affecting the company s products and to those matters discussed in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
management uses its best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external advice 
estimates are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
retail store acquisitions the company accounts for the acquisition of retail stores and related assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires application of the purchase method for all business combinations initiated after june  accounting for these transactions as purchase business combinations requires the allocation of purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
the amount paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is accounted for as goodwill 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of its cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which was adopted by the company on july   goodwill and other intangible assets are to be evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value 
the company conducts its required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the impairment test uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit 
this model requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis 
judgments are made with respect to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on historical experience and current economic trends 
actual losses could differ from those estimates 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following have occurred persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists eg a wholesale purchase order or retail sales invoice  the sales arrangement specifies a fixed or determinable sales price  product is shipped or services are provided to the customer  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
this generally occurs upon the shipment of goods to independent dealers or  in the case of ethan allen owned retail stores  upon delivery to the customer 
recorded sales provide for estimated returns and allowances 
the company permits retail customers to return defective products and incorrect shipments for credit against other purchases 
terms offered by the company are standard for the industry 
business insurance reserves the company has insurance programs in place to cover workers compensation and property casualty claims 
the insurance programs  which are funded through self insured retention  are subject to various stop loss limitations 
the company accrues estimated losses using actuarial models and assumptions based on historical loss experience 
although management believes that the insurance reserves are adequate  the reserve estimates are based on historical experience  which may not be indicative of current and future losses 
in addition  the actuarial calculations used to estimate insurance reserves are based on numerous assumptions  some of which are subjective 
the company adjusts insurance reserves  as needed  in the event that future loss experience differs from historical loss patterns 
other loss reserves the company has a number of other potential loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability  litigation  restructuring charges  and the recoverability of deferred income tax benefits 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires management s estimate and judgment with regard to maximum risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are often developed with the company s counsel  or other appropriate advisors  and are based on management s current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future

recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard amends certain financial accounting and reporting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities as prescribed in sfas no 
and other accounting pronouncements 
the adoption of fasb no 
 effective july   did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company s policy has been to utilize united states dollar denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
at june   the company had million of short term debt outstanding and million of total long term debt outstanding 
the company has one debt instrument outstanding with a variable interest rate 
this debt instrument has a principal balance of million and matures in based on the principal outstanding in  a one percentage point increase in the variable interest rate would not have had a significant impact on the company s interest expense 
currently  the company does not enter into financial instrument transactions for trading or other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate exposure
