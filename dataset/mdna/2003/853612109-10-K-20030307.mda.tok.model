item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations product profitability 
operations our principal administrative departments for our insurance subsidiaries include financial  new business and policyholder services  and information technology services it departments 
the financial department provides accounting  budgeting  tax  investment  financial reporting and actuarial services and establishes cost control systems 
the new business department reviews policy applications  and issues and administers our policies 
the policyholder services department authorizes disbursements related to claims and surrenders 
the it department oversees and administers our information processing systems 
our administrative departments use a common integrated policy administration system that permits efficiency and cost control 
our it system services approximately  active policies at december  underwriting premiums charged on life insurance products are based in part on assumptions about the incidence and timing of insurance claims 
when we issued life insurance business  we adopted and followed underwriting procedures for traditional and universal life insurance policies 
life insurance does not allow for underwriting after a policy is issued 
since we no longer issue new life insurance policies  life insurance underwriting activities are minimal and occur only when a policyholder requests a change which is subject to underwriting 
underwriting with respect to annuities is minimal 
traditional underwriting procedures are not applied to policies acquired in blocks 
in these cases  we review the mortality experience for recent years and compare actual experience to that assumed in the actuarial projections for the acquired policies 
investments investment activities are an integral part of our business as the investment income of our insurance subsidiaries is a significant part of total revenues 
profitability is significantly affected by spreads between interest earned on invested assets and rates credited on insurance liabilities 
substantially all credited rates on deferred annuities may be changed at least annually 
for the year ended december   the weighted average net yield of our investment portfolio was and the weighted average interest rate credited on our interest sensitive liability portfolio  excluding liabilities related to separate accounts and equity indexed annuities  was approximately per annum for an average investment spread of basis points at december   compared to basis points at december  the decline in the investment spread is primarily driven by the impact and significance of our annuity deposits and by the impact of realized investment losses 
annuity deposits received in were invested during a rapidly declining interest rate environment  resulting in reduced earned rates on new investments and on the asset portfolio as a whole 
in this environment  we were unable to adjust crediting rates quickly enough  on both new sales and renewal business  to maintain prior year spreads 
in addition  realized investment gains and losses resulted in reduced investment income during future increases or decreases in interest 
table of contents rates may increase or decrease the average interest rate spread between investment yields and interest rates credited on insurance liabilities  which in turn may have a beneficial or adverse effect on our future profitability 
sales of fixed maturity securities that result in investment gains may also tend to decrease future average interest rate spreads 
state insurance laws and regulations prescribe the types of permitted investments and limit their concentration in certain classes of investments 
we balance the duration of our invested assets with the expected duration of benefit payments arising from insurance liabilities 
the duration of a security is a measure of a security s price sensitivity to changes in market interest rates 
the option adjusted duration of fixed maturity securities and short term investments for our us insurance subsidiaries was and at december  and  respectively 
our investment strategy is guided by strategic objectives established by the investment committee of the board of directors 
our major investment objectives are to maximize book investment income without exposing surplus to excessive volatility  match the anticipated duration of investments with the anticipated duration of policy liabilities through our asset liability cash flow management process  maximize our company objectives for tax considerations and realized gain loss recognition  and provide sufficient liquidity to meet cash requirements with minimum sacrifice of investment yield 
consistent with this strategy  we invest primarily in securities of the us government and its agencies  investment grade utilities  corporate debt securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
when opportunities arise  below investment grade securities may be purchased  however  protection against default risk is a primary consideration 
we will not invest more than of our bond portfolio in below investment grade securities 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic assigns quality ratings to securities called naic designations which are used by insurers when preparing their annual statements 
the naic assigns ratings to publicly traded and privately placed securities 
the ratings assigned range from class to class  with a rating in class being of the highest quality 
the following table sets forth the quality of our fixed maturity securities as of december   classified in accordance with the ratings assigned by the naic percent of fixed naic rating maturity securities total investment grade total deutsche investment management americas inc manages our domestic fixed maturity securities  subject to the direction of our investment committee 
approximately of our fixed maturity securities at december  are comprised of mortgage backed securities that include collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed pass through securities 
approximately of the book value of mortgage backed securities in our portfolio are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government as to the full amount of both principal and interest and are backed by an agency of the us government although not by the full faith and credit of the us government 
we closely monitor the market value of all investments within our mortgage backed portfolio 

table of contents the following table summarizes our mortgage backed securities at december  in thousands estimated avg

certain mortgage backed securities are subject to significant prepayment risk  since  in periods of declining interest rates  mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as individuals refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of the lower current rates 
as a result  holders of mortgage backed securities may receive large prepayments on their investment  which cannot be reinvested at an interest rate comparable to the rate on the prepaying mortgages 
planned and target amortization class securities are designed to amortize in a more predictable manner by shifting the primary risk of prepayment of the underlying collateral to investors in other tranches support classes 
mortgage backed pass through securities  sequential and support class collateralized mortgage obligations  which comprised the remaining of the book value of our mortgage backed securities at december   are more sensitive to prepayment risk 
reserves our insurance subsidiaries have established and carry as liabilities in their financial statements actuarially determined liabilities to satisfy their respective annuity contract and life insurance policy obligations 
insurance policy liabilities for deferred annuities  universal life policies and international unit linked products are equal to the full account value that accrues to the policyholder cumulative premiums less certain charges  plus interest credited with credited interest rates ranging from to in and to in insurance policy liabilities for equity indexed annuity products are computed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  and consist of a book value liability for benefits guaranteed in the contract  combined with a market value liability for equity linked benefits of the contract 
we perform periodic studies to compare current experience for mortality  interest and lapse rates with projected experience used in calculating the deferred annuity and universal life insurance policy liabilities 
differences are reflected currently in earnings for each period 
historically  we have not experienced significant adverse deviations from our assumptions 

table of contents insurance policy liabilities for traditional life insurance contracts are computed using the net level premium method on the basis of assumed investment yields  mortality and withdrawals  which were appropriate at the time the policies were issued 
assumed investment yields are based on interest rates ranging from to 
mortality is based upon various actuarial tables  principally the or the select and ultimate table 
withdrawals are based upon our experience and vary by issue age  type of coverage  and duration 
reinsurance consistent with the general practice of the life insurance industry  we have reinsured portions of the coverage provided by our insurance products with other insurance companies under agreements of indemnity reinsurance 
our policy risk retention limit on the life of any one individual does not exceed  indemnity reinsurance agreements are intended to limit a life insurer s maximum loss on a particular risk or to obtain a greater diversification of risk 
indemnity reinsurance does not discharge the primary liability of the original insurer to the insured  but it is the practice of insurers for statutory accounting purposes subject to certain limitations of state insurance statutes to account for risks which have been reinsured with other approved companies  to the extent of the reinsurance  as though they are not risks for which the original insurer is liable 
however  under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts  these amounts are added back to policy reserves and recorded as amounts due from reinsurers

historically  we have not experienced material losses in collection of reinsurance receivables 
our largest annuity reinsurer at december   scor life us insurance company scor life  represented million  or of our total reinsurance recoverable and is rated a excellent by am best 
scor life limits dividends by standard life to standard management or affiliated companies if its adjusted surplus is less than of admitted assets or million at december  admitted assets are defined by the naic as probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as a result of past transactions or events which may be included in an insurance company s balance sheet 
some assets or portions of assets may be considered nonadmitted because they do not conform to the laws and regulations of various states 
therefore  certain assets which normally would be accorded value in noninsurance corporations are accorded no value and thus reduce the reported surplus of the insurance company 
standard life s adjusted surplus was million on december   therefore  scor life s approval will be required prior to the payment of dividends to standard management in 
table of contents acquisition strategy  recent acquisitions and divestiture acquisition strategy a principal component of our strategy prior to was to grow through the acquisition of life insurance companies and blocks of in force life insurance and annuities 
although our focus has been on internal organic growth since  we regularly investigate acquisition opportunities in the life insurance industry that complement or are otherwise strategically consistent with our existing business 
any decision to acquire a block of business or an insurance company will depend on a favorable evaluation of various factors 
we believe that availability of blocks of business in the marketplace will continue in response to ongoing industry consolidation  risk based capital requirements and other regulatory and rating agency concerns 
we currently have no plans or commitments to acquire any specific insurance business or other material assets 
we have information systems and administrative capabilities necessary to add additional blocks of business without a proportional increase in operating expenses 
in addition  we have developed management techniques for reducing or eliminating the expenses of the companies we acquire through the consolidation of their operations 
such techniques include reduction or elimination of overhead  including the acquired company s management  staff and home office  elimination of marketing expenses and  where appropriate  the substitution of standard life s distribution network for the acquired company s current distribution system  and the conversion of the acquired company s data processing operations to our system 
we typically acquire companies or blocks of business through the purchase or exchange of shares 
this method is also used for assumption reinsurance transactions 
any future acquisitions may be subject to certain regulatory approvals  policyholder consents and stockholder approval 
in  our acquisition strategy included acquiring companies to distribute retail and third party reimbursed products and services 
see recent acquisitions below 
in addition  in  we capitalized on our previous investment by selling our international operations which allowed us to not only create a new subsidiary  us health services  but also to fund current growth in our domestic insurance operations 
recent acquisitions during  we acquired  for cash  the pharmaceutical business of homemed channel  inc and pca  llc 
in addition  in december  we purchased assets of prescriptions by mail  inc  which was financed primarily by a promissory note 
all three acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
in  us health services  a wholly owned subsidiary of standard management corporation  was formed to distribute retail and third party reimbursed products and services through direct to consumer as well as institutional channels 
divestiture in  we sold the international operations which consisted of of the shares in premier life luxembourg and the portfolio of premier life bermuda to winterthur life  a division of credit suisse group  resulting in a gain from the sale of discontinued operations of million 
with the net proceeds received from the sale  we made a million capital contribution to standard life  repaid million in debt  and retained the remaining million for general corporate purposes 
competition the life insurance industry is highly competitive and consists of a large number of both stock and mutual insurance companies  many of which have substantially greater financial resources  broader and more diversified product lines and larger staffs than those possessed by standard management 
according to the american council of life insurers  there were approximately  life insurance companies in the united states  which may offer insurance products similar to ours 
competition within the life insurance industry occurs on the basis of  among other things  product features such as price and interest rates  perceived financial stability of the insurer  policyholder service  name recognition and ratings assigned by insurance rating organizations 
we must also compete with other insurers to attract and retain the allegiance of agents 
we believe that competition centers more on the strength of the agent relationship rather than on the insurer s name recognition to the customer 
we offer 
table of contents competitive products  competitive commission structures  internet based agent services  prompt policy issuance and responsive policyholder service and believe we are successful in attracting and retaining agents 
competition also is encountered from the expanding number of banks  securities brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries which are marketing insurance products and which offer competing products such as savings accounts and securities 
we began distributing annuities through financial institutions as a result of the acquisition of savers marketing in march the passage  by congress  of the gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act glb act has expanded competitive opportunities for non insurance financial services companies 
financial institutions  marketing companies  agents who market insurance products and policyholders use the ratings of an insurer as one factor in determining which insurer s annuity to market or purchase 
standard life and dixie life have a rating of b and b  respectively  by am best 
a rating of b is assigned by am best to companies that  in their opinion  have achieved very good overall performance when compared to the standards established by am best  and have a good ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 
a rating of b is assigned by am best to companies that  in their opinion  have achieved good overall performance when compared to the standards established by am best 
according to am best  these companies generally have an adequate ability to meet their obligations to policyholders  but their financial strength is vulnerable to unfavorable changes in underwriting or economic conditions 
in evaluating a company s financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  leverage and liquidity as well as the company s book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated market value of its assets  the adequacy of its reserves and the experience and competence of its management 
am best s ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders  agents  insurance brokers and intermediaries and are not directed to the protection of investors 
generally  rating agencies base their ratings on information furnished to them by the issuer and on their own investigations  studies and assumptions by the rating agencies 
there is no assurance that any particular rating will continue for any given period of time or that it will not be changed or withdrawn entirely if  in the judgment of the rating agency  circumstances so warrant 
although a higher rating by am best or another insurance rating organization could have a favorable effect on standard life s business  management believes that it is able to compete on the basis of their competitive crediting rates  asset quality  strong relations with its independent agents and the quality of service to its policyholders 
the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive  both regionally and nationally 
we must compete with other retail pharmacies and national mail order internet pharmacies  which distribute prescription and non prescription over the counter products 
we believe we offer pharmaceutical products at competitive prices with prompt service and are successful in maintaining customer satisfaction 
federal income taxation we file a consolidated return with our non insurance subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes  and beginning january  with our insurance subsidiaries  standard life and dixie life 
at december   we have a net capital loss carryforward of approximately million  which expires in effective january   we entered into a tax sharing agreement with savers marketing and standard management international that allocates the consolidated federal income tax liability 
in  savers marketing paid 
million and standard management international paid 
million in accordance with this agreement 
in  savers marketing paid 
million and standard management international recovered 
million in accordance with this agreement 
standard management international terminated its participation in this agreement with the sale of our international operations 
the products marketed and issued by standard life generally provide the policyholder with an income tax advantage  as compared to other saving investments such as certificates of deposit and bonds  in that income taxation on the increase in value of the product is deferred until receipt by the policyholder 
with other savings investments  the increase in value is taxed as earned 
life insurance benefits that accrue prior to the death of the policyholder  and annuity benefits  are generally not taxable until paid  and life insurance death benefits are generally exempt from income tax 
the tax advantage for life insurance and annuity products is provided in the internal revenue code of  as amended  and is generally followed in all states and other us taxing jurisdictions 
accordingly  it is subject to change by congress and the legislatures of the respective taxing jurisdictions 

table of contents inflation a primary direct effect of inflation is an increase to our operating expenses 
a large portion of our operating expenses consists of salaries  which are subject to wage increases at least partly affected by the rate of inflation 
the rate of inflation also affects us indirectly 
to the extent that the government s economic policy to control the level of inflation results in changes in our interest rates  our new sales of annuity products  investment income and withdrawal rates are affected 
changes in the level of interest rates also have an effect on interest spreads  as investment earnings are reinvested 
regulatory factors our insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled and the insurance regulatory bodies in the other jurisdictions in which they are licensed to sell insurance 
the purpose of such regulation is primarily to ensure the financial stability of insurance companies and to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interest of stockholders or debtholders 
the insurance laws of various jurisdictions establish regulatory agencies with broad administrative powers relating to the licensing of insurers and their agents  the regulation of trade practices  management agreements  the types of permitted investments and maximum concentration  deposits of securities  the form and content of financial statements  premiums charged by insurance companies  sales literature and insurance policies  accounting practices and the maintenance of specified reserves and capital and surplus 
our insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed periodic financial reports with supervisory agencies in certain jurisdictions 
most states have also enacted legislation regulating insurance holding company activities including acquisitions  extraordinary dividends  terms of surplus debentures  terms of affiliate transactions and other related matters 
the insurance holding company laws and regulations vary by state  but generally require an insurance holding company and its insurance company subsidiaries licensed to do business in the state to register and file certain reports with the regulatory authorities  including information concerning capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and general business operations 
state holding company laws also require prior notice or regulatory agency approval of certain material intercompany transfers of assets within the holding company structure 
recently a number of state regulators have considered or have enacted legislative proposals that change  and in many cases increase  the authority of state agencies to regulate insurance companies and holding companies 
for additional information on state laws regulating insurance company subsidiaries  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements 
under indiana insurance law  standard life may not enter into certain transactions  including management agreements and service contracts  with members of its insurance holding company system  including standard management  unless standard life has notified the indiana department of insurance of its intention to enter into these transactions and the indiana department of insurance has not disapproved of them within the period specified by indiana law 
among other things  these transactions are subject to the requirement that their terms and charges or fees for services performed be fair and reasonable 
the indiana insurance laws and regulations require that the statutory surplus of standard life following any dividend or distribution be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs 
the indiana department of insurance may bring an action to enjoin or rescind the payment of a dividend or distribution by standard life that would cause its statutory surplus to be unreasonable or inadequate under this requirement 
most states  including indiana  require administrative approval of the acquisition of or more of the outstanding shares of an insurance company incorporated in the state or the acquisition of or more of the outstanding shares of an insurance holding company whose insurance subsidiary is incorporated in the state 
the request for approval must be accompanied by detailed information concerning the acquiring parties and the plan of acquisition 
the acquisition of of these shares is generally deemed to be the acquisition of control for the purpose of the holding company statutes 
however  in many states the insurance authorities may find that control in fact does or does not exist in circumstances in which a person owns or controls either a lesser or a greater amount of securities 
in some instances state regulatory authorities require deposits of assets for the protection of either policyholders in those states or for all policyholders 
at december   securities of million or approximately 
of the book value of our us insurance subsidiaries invested assets were on deposit with various state treasurers or custodians 
these deposits must consist of securities that comply with the standards that the particular state has established 

table of contents in recent years  naic  and state insurance regulators have examined existing laws and regulations and their application to insurance companies 
this examination has focused on insurance company investment and solvency issues  risk based capital guidelines  assumption reinsurance  interpretations of existing laws  the development of new laws  the interpretation of non statutory guidelines  the standardization of statutory accounting rules and the circumstances under which dividends may be paid 
the naic has encouraged states to adopt model naic laws on specific topics such as holding company regulations and the definition of extraordinary dividends 
we are unable to predict the future impact of changing state regulation on our operations 
the naic  as well as indiana and mississippi  have each adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life and health insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks 
state insurance regulators use the rbc requirements as regulatory tools only  which aid in the identification of insurance companies that could potentially lack sufficient capital 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio the rbc ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital to its authorized control level rbc 
the two components of the rbc ratio are defined by the naic 
the rbc ratios that require corrective action are as follows level rbc ratio corrective action company action company is required to submit a plan to improve its rbc ratio regulatory action regulators will order corrective actions authorized control regulators are authorized to take control of the company mandatory control less than regulators must take over the company at december   the rbc ratios of standard life and dixie life were both at least one and a half times greater than the levels at which company action is required 
if these rbc ratios should decline in the future  our subsidiaries might be subject to increased regulatory supervision and decreased ability to pay dividends  management fees and surplus debenture interest to standard management 
on the basis of annual statutory statements filed with state regulators  the naic calculates financial ratios to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies 
a usual range of results for each ratio is used as a benchmark 
in the past  variances in certain ratios of our insurance subsidiaries have resulted in inquiries from insurance departments to which we have responded 
such inquiries did not lead to any restrictions affecting our operations 
we attempt to manage our assets and liabilities so that income and principal payments received from investments are adequate to meet the cash flow requirements of our policyholder liabilities 
the cash flows of our liabilities are affected by actual maturities  surrender experience and credited interest rates 
we periodically perform cash flow studies under various interest rate scenarios to evaluate the adequacy of expected cash flows from our assets to meet the expected cash requirements of our liabilities 
we utilize these studies to determine if it is necessary to lengthen or shorten the average life and duration of our investment portfolio 
because of the significant uncertainties involved in the estimation of asset and liability cash flows  there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage the relationship between our asset and liability cash flows 
the statutory filings of our insurance subsidiaries require classifications of investments and the establishment of an asset valuation reserve  designed to stabilize a company s statutory surplus against fluctuations in the market value of stocks and bonds  according to regulations prescribed by the naic 
the asset valuation reserve consists of two main components a default component to provide for future credit related losses on fixed income investments and an equity component to provide for losses on all types of equity investments  including real estate 
the naic requires an additional reserve  called the interest maintenance reserve  which consists of the portion of realized capital gains and losses from the sale of fixed income securities attributable to changes in interest rates 
the interest maintenance reserve is required to be amortized against earnings on a basis reflecting the remaining period to maturity of the fixed income securities sold 
these regulations affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to reflect investment gains and losses in current period statutory earnings and surplus 

table of contents the amounts related to asset valuation reserve and interest maintenance reserve for the insurance subsidiaries at december  are summarized as follows in thousands maximum asset asset interest valuation reserve valuation reserve maintenance reserve standard life dixie life the annual addition to the asset valuation reserve consists of a factor based basic contribution plus of the difference between the reserve objective and the accumulated balance 
if the calculated reserve with current year additions exceeds the maximum reserve amount  the reserve is reduced to the maximum amount 
for the year ended december   our us subsidiaries each made the required contribution to the asset valuation reserve 
most jurisdictions require insurance companies to participate in guaranty funds designed to cover claims against insolvent insurers 
insurers authorized to transact business in these jurisdictions are generally subject to assessments based on annual direct premiums written in that jurisdiction to pay such claims  if any 
these assessments may be deferred or forgiven under most guaranty laws if they would threaten an insurer s financial strength and  in certain instances  may be offset against future state premium taxes 
the incurrence and amount of such assessments have increased in recent years and may increase further in future years 
the likelihood and amount of all future assessments cannot be reasonably estimated and are beyond our control 
as part of their routine regulatory oversight process  approximately once every three to five years  state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books  records and accounts of insurance companies domiciled in their states 
standard life had an examination during for the five year period ended december  and dixie life had an examination during for the three year period ended december  these final examination reports were issued in with no adjustments to the statutory statements required 
the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business 
however  federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas  including pension regulation  age and sex discrimination  financial services regulation and federal taxation  do affect the insurance business 
in addition  legislation has been introduced from time to time in recent years  which  if enacted  could result in the federal government assuming a more direct role in the regulation of the insurance industry 
the glb act has left the currently existing regime of state insurance regulation largely intact  however  more comprehensive federal legislation in this area is still being actively considered by congress 
in addition  the pharmaceutical industry has long been subject to regulation by various federal  state and local agencies  primarily as to product manufacture  safety  efficacy  advertising and labeling 
in addition  governmental bodies in the united states as well as other countries have expressed concern about costs relating to health care  and in some cases  have focused attention on the pricing of drugs and on appropriate drug utilization 
government regulation may be expanded significantly in the united states in the future 
we are unable to predict the extent to which our business may be affected by future regulatory developments 
employees as of january   we had employees 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  marketing  support and management personnel

table of contents product profitability the long term profitability of life insurance and annuity products depends on the accuracy of the actuarial assumptions that underlie the pricing of such products 
actuarial calculations for such insurance products  and the ultimate profitability of such products  are based on four major factors persistency  mortality  return on cash invested by the insurer during the life of the policy and expenses of acquiring and administering the policies 
interest spreads represent a major profit source on interest sensitive life and annuity products  so margins on these products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  we are able to maintain spreads by adjusting credited interest rates for changes in our earned rates  subject to competitive and timing constraints 
however  there are corollary effects of interest rate changes 
rising interest rates result in a decline in the market value of assets  and also tend to result in increased policyholder surrenders as other investment options become relatively more attractive 
the effect of increased surrenders is to reduce earnings over the long term 
current period earnings effect may vary depending on the level of surrender charges and deferred policy acquisition costs dac and present value of future profits pvfp assets 
in addition  increasing interest rates give rise to disintermediation risk  the risk that assets must be sold at depressed values in order to fund increased surrender payments 
this risk is mitigated by properly matching assets and liabilities 
we seek to closely match the estimated duration of our invested assets to the expected duration of our liabilities 
when the estimated durations of assets and liabilities are similar  exposure to interest rate risk is minimized because a change in the value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities 
a significant mismatch of the durations of invested assets and liabilities could have an impact on our future financial results 
declining interest rates generally have little immediate effect on our investment earnings rates 
over time  as we invest positive cash flows at lower rates  our earned rates decline 
in such an environment  we attempt to adjust credited interest rates accordingly  subject to competitive pressures 
in most situations  this action allows us to maintain our margins 
however  the sustained period of low interest rates may impact future interest spreads  results of operations and financial condition 
the average expected remaining life of standard life s traditional life and annuity business in force at december  was years 
this calculation was determined based upon our actuarial models and assumptions as to expected persistency and mortality 
persistency is the extent to which insurance policies sold are maintained by the insured 
the persistency of life insurance and annuity products is a critical element of their profitability 
however  a surrender charge often applies in the early contract years and declines to zero over time 
life insurance policyholders sometimes do not pay premiums  thus causing their policies to lapse 
for the years  and standard life experienced total policy lapses  excluding surrenders  of  and of total policies in force at december of each year  respectively 
ongoing premiums are not required for annuity policies  so annuities do not experience policy lapses 
variances between actual and expected profits 
actual experience on purchased and produced insurance may vary from projections due to differences in renewal premiums collected  investment spreads  mortality costs  persistency  administrative costs and other factors 
variances from original projections  whether positive or negative  are included in net income as they occur 
to the extent that these variances indicate that future experience will differ from the estimated profits reflected in the capitalization and amortization of the pvfp and dac assets  current and future amortization rates may be adjusted 
product accounting present value of future profits 
in accordance with industry practice  when we purchase a block of existing insurance business  we assign a portion of the purchase price  pvfp  as the pre tax value of the business acquired 
the asset is the discounted value of future cash flows arising from the existing block of business 
the discount rate used is based upon many elements  such as yields generated on similar business  our cost of capital and the interest rate environment as of the purchase date 
discount rates used in determining our pvfp assets range from to 
after purchase  amortization of the asset occurs in proportion to profits emerging from the purchased policies 
the asset is amortized over the expected life of the block of business 
the percentages of expected net amortization of the beginning balance of the total pvfp asset as of december  are expected to be between and in each of the years through 
table of contents deferred policy acquisition costs 
insurance policies issued after the purchase date of a company will generate significant costs that vary directly with and relate to the acquisition of the new business 
under gaap accounting rules  these acquisition costs on new policies are to be capitalized and recorded as dac 
for universal and interest sensitive life and annuity products  the dac asset is amortized in proportion to estimated gross profits over the life of the contract 
for immediate annuities  dac is amortized so as to produce a constant yield on the net policyholder liability 
virtually all of our dac is a result of writing annuity products 
amortization of dac related to operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in current year amortization expense resulted primarily from the emergence of gross profits from business sold in recent years and the acceleration of dac amortization due to dac unlocking 
future expected amortization of dac  assuming no new business after december  and current assumptions  is as follows in thousands gross amortization interest accumulation net amortization accounting for deferred annuities and universal and interest sensitive life products

 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses on the sale of investments 
under sfas no 
 a benefit reserve is established at the time of policy issuance in an amount equal to the deposits received 
thereafter  the benefit reserve is adjusted for any additional deposits  interest credited and partial or complete withdrawals 
revenues for annuities and universal and interest sensitive life policies  other than certain non interest sensitive annuities  consist of policy charges for surrenders and partial withdrawals  mortality and administration  and investment income earned 
these revenues do not include the annuity  universal and interest sensitive life policy deposits 
expenses related to these products include interest credited to policyowner account balances  operating costs for policy administration  amortization of dac and mortality costs in excess of account balances 
costs relating to the acquisition of new business  primarily commissions paid to agents  which vary with and are directly related to the production of new business  are deferred to the extent that such costs are recoverable from future profit margins 
at the time of issuance  the acquisition expenses  approximately of our initial annuity premium deposits are capitalized as dac 
in accordance with sfas no 
 dac with interest is amortized over the lives of the policies in a constant relationship to the present value of estimated future gross profits 
accounting for equity indexed annuities 
revenues and expenses for equity indexed annuities are recognized in accordance with the sfas no 
model  described above 
policy liabilities for equity indexed annuities are computed in accordance with sfas no 
which requires that an equity indexed annuity liability be bifurcated into a host contract and a derivative contract 
the host contract liability is a book value liability providing for the equity indexed annuity policy s guaranteed benefits 
the derivative contract liability is a market value liability providing for the equity linked benefits available in the policy 
the derivative liability includes a liability for equity linked benefits accruing during the current contract year  as well as liability amounts for future equity benefits which have not yet been granted 
accounting for traditional life products 
traditional life insurance products are accounted as long duration insurance contracts in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
under sfas no 
 benefit reserves are actuarially calculated using the net level reserve method 
revenues consist of policy premiums and investment income on assets supporting policy liabilities 
expenses consist of policy benefits incurred  increases in policy liabilities  and operating costs for policy administration  and amortization of dac 

table of contents costs related to the acquisition of new business  primarily commissions paid to agents  which vary with and are directly related to the production of new business  are deferred to the extent that such costs are recoverable from future profit margins 
at the time of issuance  the acquisition expenses are capitalized as dac 
in accordance with sfas no 
 dac with interest is amortized over the lives of the policies in a constant relationship to policy premiums 
accounting for immediate annuities 
immediate annuities with no life contingent payments  which comprise the majority of our immediate annuities in force and the majority of new immediate annuity sales  are accounted as investment contracts in accordance with fas no 
revenues consist of investment income  and expenses consist of the imputed interest credits to policies as well as operating costs for policy administration 
an initial net premium policy liability is established as initial premium less acquisition costs 
the imputed credited rate is the rate  which equates this net premium to the guaranteed payments 
after issue  the liability changes by the amount of imputed interest credits and benefit payments 
for balance sheet purposes  this net premium liability is presented as a gross premium liability offset by a dac asset 
immediate annuities with payments contingent on the survival of the annuitant are accounted as limited payment contracts in accordance with fas no 
 with revenue recognition  expense recognition  and liabilities computed as described above for traditional life products 
critical accounting policies the accounting polices described below require management to make significant estimates and assumptions using information available at the time the estimates are made 
such estimates and assumptions significantly affect various reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
management has made estimates in the past that we believed to be appropriate but were subsequently revised to reflect actual experience 
if our future experience differs materially from these estimates and assumptions  our results of operations and financial condition could be affected 
accordingly  we consider them to be critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
a more detailed description of our accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
investments the carrying value of our investment portfolio was billion at december  the accounting risks associated with these assets relate to the recognition of income  our determination of other than temporary impairments and our estimation of fair values 
we amortize premiums and discounts as yield adjustments over the contractual lives of fixed maturity securities 
we consider anticipated prepayments on mortgage backed securities in determining estimated future yields on such securities 
when we sell a security  we report the difference between the sales proceeds and amortized cost determined based on specific identification as an investment gain or loss 
we periodically evaluate whether the declines in fair value of our investments are other than temporary 
our evaluation consists of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors 
for investments with publicly quoted market prices  we generally consider a decline to be an other than temporary impairment if the quoted market price is less than its accounting basis for three quarters  absent evidence to the contrary 
we also consider additional factors to determine whether the declines in fair value are other than temporary  such as downgrades of the security by a rating agency  deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer  and other publicly available issuer specific news or general market conditions 
for investments in companies with no quoted market price  we consider similar qualitative and quantitative factors and also take into account the cost of the investment  the type of investment  subsequent purchases of the same or similar investments  the current financial position and operating results of the company invested in  and such other factors as may be relevant 
declines in fair values of securities deemed to be other than temporary are recognized as a reduction of net income 
determining what constitutes an other than temporary decline involves significant judgment 
declines in fair value below cost not considered other than temporary in the current period could be considered other than temporary in a future period and reduce earnings to the extent of the write down 
estimated fair values for our investments are determined based on estimates from nationally recognized pricing services  broker dealer market makers  and internally developed methods 
our internally developed methods require us to make judgments about the security s credit quality  liquidity and market spread 

table of contents equity indexed call options are derivative instruments linked to the major stock indices s p index and djia which are used to hedge the equity benefits of our equity indexed annuity products 
we purchase call options whose payoff characteristics mirror the equity benefits of our products 
these securities are carried at fair value and the change in fair value is included in net investment income 
dac and pvfp the combined balance of our dac and pvfp was million 
the recovery of these costs is dependent on the future profitability of the related business at december  each year  we evaluate the recoverability of the unamortized balance of the dac and pvfp 
we consider estimated future gross profits or future premiums  expected mortality or morbidity  interest earned and credited rates  persistency and expenses in determining whether the balance is recoverable 
if we determine a portion of the unamortized balance is not recoverable  it is charged to amortization expense 
the assumptions we use to amortize and evaluate the recoverability of the dac and pvfp involve significant judgment 
a significant revision to these assumptions will impact future financial results 
goodwill the balance of our goodwill was million at december  the recovery of this asset is dependent on the fair value of the business to which it relates 
prior to january   these assets were generally amortized over a year period 
effective in  pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests based on the estimated fair value of the business units that comprise our domestic segment 
there are numerous assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the estimated fair value of these businesses 
different valuation methods and assumptions can produce significantly different results that could affect the amount of any potential impairment charge that might be required to be recognized 
a charge of million resulting from the impairment of goodwill from the adoption of sfas no 
was recorded in income taxes our income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and capital loss carryforwards 
we have gross deferred income tax assets of million at december  in assessing the realization of our deferred income tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets depends upon generating future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary differences become deductible and capital gains before our capital loss carryforwards expire 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets by assessing the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be recovered  a valuation allowance will be established against some or all of our deferred income tax assets 
this could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
no valuation allowance has been provided on our deferred income tax assets at december   as we believe it is more likely than not that all such assets will be realized 
we reached this conclusion after considering the availability of taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies  and the likelihood of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
differences between forecasted and actual future operating results could adversely impact our ability to realize our deferred income tax assets 
liabilities for insurance products the total balance of our liabilities for insurance products was billion at december  these liabilities are often payable over an extended period of time and the profitability of the related products is dependent on the pricing of the products and other factors 
differences between pricing assumptions and actual experience will impact future financial results 
we calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of claims to our policyholders based on actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions are generally best estimates  with moderate provision for adverse deviation 
many factors can affect the adequacy of these reserves and liabilities  such as economic and social conditions  inflation  changes in doctrines of legal liability and extra contractual damage awards 
therefore  the reserves and liabilities we establish are necessarily based on extensive estimates  assumptions and historical experience 
establishing reserves is an uncertain 
table of contents process  and it is possible that actual claims will materially exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our financial results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in determining our reserves and pricing our products 
if our assumptions with respect to future claims are incorrect  and our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and expenses  we would be required to increase our liabilities  negatively affecting our operating results 
liabilities for loss contingencies related to legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
we recognize an estimated loss from these loss contingencies when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  it is difficult to measure the actual loss that might be incurred related to legal proceedings 
the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position based on our current understanding of the relevant facts and laws

although deposits received on our interest sensitive annuities and other financial products are not included in cash flow from operations under gaap  these funds are available 
cash provided by operations plus net deposits received  less net account balances returned to policyholders on interest sensitive annuities and other financial products  resulted in positive cash flow of million and million for and  respectively 
cash generated on a consolidated basis is available only to the extent that it is generated at the holding company level or is available through interest  dividends  management fees or other payments from our subsidiaries 
at february   we had parent company only cash and short term investments of million 
these funds are available for general corporate purposes 
our parent company only operating expenses not including interest expense were million and million for and  respectively 
liquidity of insurance operations us insurance operations 
the principal liquidity requirements of standard life are its contractual obligations to policyholders  surplus debenture interest  dividends  management fees and rental fees to standard management and operating expenses 
the primary source of funding for these obligations has been cash flow from premium income  net investment income  investment sales and maturities and sales of annuity products 
these sources of liquidity for standard life significantly exceed scheduled uses 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death benefits  policy withdrawals and surrenders 
the amount of withdrawals and surrenders is affected by a variety of factors such as renewal interest crediting rates  interest rates for competing products  general economic conditions  standard life s am best rating and events in the industry that affect policyholders confidence 
in august  standard life received a rating from am best of b  or very good category  a one category reduction from its previous rating of b very good 
am best cited rapid growth in the annuity business  modest risk adjusted capitalization and high exposure to below investment grade bonds as a percentage of capital and surplus  as the primary reasons for the rating change 
the policies and annuities issued by standard life contain provisions that allow policyholders to withdraw or surrender their policies under defined circumstances 
these policies and annuities generally contain provisions  which apply penalties or otherwise restrict the ability of policyholders to make such withdrawals or surrenders 
standard life closely monitors the surrender and policy loan activity of its insurance products and manages the composition of its investment portfolios  including liquidity  to ensure it has sufficient cash resources in light of such activity 
changes in interest rates may affect our incidence of policy surrenders and other withdrawals 
in addition to the potential effect on liquidity  unanticipated withdrawals in a changing interest rate environment could adversely affect our earnings if we were required to sell investments at reduced values to meet liquidity demands 
we manage our asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings effect of changing market interest rates 
we seek assets that have duration characteristics similar to the liabilities that they support 
we also prepare cash flow projections and perform cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy 
our us insurance subsidiaries currently expect available liquidity sources and future cash flows to be adequate to meet the demand for funds 

table of contents statutory surplus is computed according to rules prescribed by the naic as modified by the indiana department of insurance  or the state in which our insurance subsidiaries do business 
statutory accounting rules are different from gaap and are intended to reflect a more conservative perspective 
with respect to new business  statutory accounting practices require that acquisition costs primarily commissions and policy issue costs and reserves for future guaranteed principal payments and interest in excess of statutory rates  be expensed in the year the new business is written 
these items cause a reduction in statutory surplus or surplus strain in the year written for many insurance products 
we design our products to minimize such first year losses  but certain products continue to cause a statutory loss in the year written 
our long term growth goals contemplate continued growth in our insurance businesses 
to achieve these growth goals  our us insurance subsidiaries will need to increase statutory surplus 
additional statutory surplus may be secured through various sources such as internally generated statutory earnings  infusions with funds generated through our debt or equity offerings  or mergers with other life insurance companies 
if additional capital is not available from one or more of these sources  we believe that we could reduce surplus strain through the use of reinsurance or through reduced writing of new business 
we believe that the operational cash flow of standard life will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for as of december   standard life had statutory capital and surplus for regulatory purposes of million 
as the annuity business produced by standard life increases  standard life expects to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements through statutory profits and through additional capital contributions by standard management 
net cash flow from operations on a statutory basis of standard life  after payment of benefits and operating expenses  was million and million for and  respectively 
if the need arises for cash  which is not readily available  additional liquidity could be obtained from the sale of invested assets 
factors that may affect future results we are subject to a number of factors affecting our business  including intense competition in the industry and the ability to attract and retain agents and employees 
if we are unable to respond appropriately to any of these factors  business and financial results could suffer 
our operating results are affected by many factors  including competition  lapse rates  interest rates  maintenance of insurance ratings  governmental regulation and general business conditions  many of which are outside our control 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and are in direct competition with a large number of insurance companies  many of which offer a greater number of products through a greater number of agents and have greater resources 
in addition  we may be subject  from time to time  to new competition resulting from additional insurance carriers introducing products similar to those offered by us 
moreover  as a result of recent federal legislation  commercial banks  insurance companies  and investment banks may now combine  provided certain requirements are satisfied  and we expect to encounter increased competition from these providers of financial services 
this competitive environment could result in lower premiums  loss of sales and reduced profitability 
our management believes that the ability to compete is dependent upon  among other things  the ability to retain and attract independent general agents to market products and the ability to develop competitive products that also are profitable 
although management believes that good relationships with our independent general agents exist  competition for those agents among insurance companies is intense 
our independent general agents typically represent other insurance companies and may sell products that compete with our products 
sales of our annuity products and  therefore  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining independent agents and marketing organizations 
see business of standard management competition 
our success also depends upon the continued contributions of key officers and employees 
should one or more of these individuals leave or otherwise become unavailable for any reason  business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see business of standard management employees 
financial results could suffer if our am best ratings are downgraded 
insurers compete with other insurance companies  financial intermediaries and other institutions on the basis of a number of factors  including the ratings assigned by am best 
am best assigns ratings labeled a through f superior  excellent  very good  fair  marginal  weak  poor  under regulatory supervision  and in liquidation 
standard life and dixie life have a rating of b very good and b fair  respectively  by am best 
am best s ratings represent their opinion based on a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative review of our 
table of contents financial strength  operating performance and market profile 
a rating of b is assigned by am best to companies that  in their opinion  have achieved very good overall performance when compared to the standards established by am best  and have a good ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 
a rating of b is assigned by am best to companies that  in their opinion  have achieved good overall performance when compared to the standards established by am best 
according to am best  these companies generally have an adequate ability to meet their obligations to policyholders  but their financial strength is vulnerable to unfavorable changes in underwriting or economic conditions 
in evaluating a company s financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  leverage and liquidity as well as the company s book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated market value of its assets  the adequacy of its reserves  and the experience and competence of its management 
am best reviews its ratings of insurance companies from time to time 
if the am best ratings were downgraded  sales of annuity products could be significantly impacted and the financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see business of standard management competition 
changes in governmental regulation and legislation could have a substantial impact on our profitability 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business 
changes in these regulations could have a significant impact on our profitability 
the primary purpose of these regulations is to protect policyholders  not investors 
these regulations are vested in governmental agencies having broad administrative power with respect to all aspects of our insurance business  including premium rates  policy forms and applications  marketing illustrations  dividend payments  capital adequacy and the amount and type of investments we may have 
the naic  and state insurance regulators continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and their application to insurance companies 
changes in the naic or state regulations  including  for example  changes in the risk based capital requirements  which are determined by the naic and state regulators  could affect the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us which could affect our ability to make payments to you 
in addition  the federal government has become increasingly involved with insurance regulation in recent years  including the passage of the gramm leach bliley act  and more comprehensive federal legislation in this area is still being considered by congress 
federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas  including pension regulation  age and sex discrimination  financial services regulation and federal taxation  affect us specifically and the insurance business in general 
new state or federal laws or regulations  as well as a more strict interpretation of existing laws or regulations  may adversely affect our current claims exposure  adversely affect the profitability of our current and future products  and materially affect our future operations by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance 
we cannot predict the impact of future state or federal laws or regulations on our business 
see business of standard management regulatory factors 
interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect spread income 
significant changes in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the credited interest rates paid on outstanding policies 
both rising and declining interest rates can negatively affect spread income 
although we develop and maintain asset liability management programs and procedures designed to preserve spread income in rising or falling interest rate environments  changes in interest rates could adversely affect these spreads 
our financial results are highly dependent on the financial condition of the companies in which we make investments and could suffer if the value of our investments decreases due to factors beyond our control 
our invested assets  approximately billion  represented approximately of our total assets at december  these investments are subject to customary risks of credit defaults and changes in market values 
in addition  the value of our investment portfolio depends in part on the financial condition of the companies in which we have made investments 
factors beyond our control  including interest rate levels  financial market performance  and general economic conditions may have a significant negative impact on our investment income and the value of our investment assets  which would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 
our substantial reliance on reinsurers could cause our financial results to suffer 
we are able to assume insurance risks beyond the level which our capital and surplus would support by transferring substantial portions of risks to other  larger insurers through reinsurance contracts 
approximately of our life insurance 
table of contents in force and of our annuity policy liabilities have risks that we have reinsured through reinsurance contracts 
however  these reinsurance arrangements leave us exposed to credit risk  which exists because reinsurance does not fully relieve us of our liability to our policyholders for the portion of the risks ceded to reinsurers 
this liability may exceed our established reserves  which would have a significant negative affect on our net income 
in addition  reinsurance may not continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates 
if reinsurance is not available to us in the future  the amounts we reserve as liabilities for payment of claims would significantly increase and the amount and value of policies we sell would significantly decrease  which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our policy claims fluctuate from year to year  and future benefit payments may exceed our established reserves  which would cause our earnings to suffer 
our earnings are significantly dependent upon the extent to which the actual claims received by our subsidiaries is consistent with the actuarial assumptions we use in establishing reserves for the payment of benefit claims 
to the extent that the actual claims experience of our subsidiaries exceeds our established reserves  our operating income would be negatively affected  resulting in an adverse effect on our earnings 
volatility in benefit claims is common in the life insurance industry 
while our reserves have been sufficient to cover policy claims in the past and we attempt to limit the risk by carefully underwriting new policies and sharing risks with reinsurance companies  we may still experience a period of higher than anticipated benefit claims that exceeds our established reserves 
if this were to happen  it could result in increased operating losses 
because a significant portion of our annuity contracts are surrenderable  any substantial increase in the level of surrenders could negatively affect financial results 
as of december   approximately or billion of annuity contracts in force measured by statutory reserves were surrenderable 
approximately of those contracts or approximately million of annuity contracts in force measured by statutory reserves are surrenderable without charge 
changes in prevailing interest rates  ratings or other factors which result in or lead to significant levels of surrenders of existing annuity contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
surrenders result in a reduction of invested assets that earn investment income and a reduction of policyholder account balances that credit interest 
our financial results could be materially adversely affected if our assumptions regarding the value of intangible assets prove to be incorrect 
included in our financial statements are certain assets that are primarily valued  for financial statement purposes  on the basis of management s assumptions 
these assets include items such as deferred policy acquisition costs  present value of future profits  goodwill  and organization and deferred debt issuance costs 
the assumptions are based upon  among others  interest rate spread and rates of mortality  surrender and lapse 
if  for instance  future mortality rates were higher than expected  projected margins would be lower and deferred policy acquisition cost amortization would increase 
the value of these assets reflected in our december  balance sheet totaled million  or of our assets 
although we have established procedures to periodically review the assumptions used to value these assets and determine the need to make adjustments  if our assumptions are incorrect and adjustments need to be made  our financial results could be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to invest available funds in a manner that will maximize shareholder value and fund future obligations to policyholders and debtors  subject to appropriate risk considerations 
many of our products incorporate surrender charges  market interest rate adjustments or other features to encourage persistency 
approximately of the total insurance 
table of contents liabilities at december  had surrender penalties or other restrictions and approximately are not subject to surrender 
we also seek to maximize the total return on our investments through active investment management 
accordingly  we have determined that the entire portfolio of fixed maturity securities is available to be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in relative values of individual securities and asset sectors  changes in prepayment risks  changes in credit quality outlook for certain securities  liquidity needs  and other factors 
profitability of many of our products is significantly affected by the spreads between interest yields on investments and rates credited on insurance liabilities 
although substantially all credited rates on annuity products may be changed annually subject to minimum guaranteed rates  changes in competition and other factors  including the impact of the level of surrenders and withdrawals  may limit the ability to adjust or to maintain crediting rates at levels necessary to avoid narrowing of spreads under certain market conditions 
as of december   the average yield  computed on the cost basis of the investment portfolio  was  and the average interest rate credited or accruing to total insurance liabilities was  excluding guaranteed interest bonuses for the first year of the annuity contract 
computer models were used to perform simulations of the cash flows generated from our existing business under various interest rate scenarios 
these simulations measured the potential gain or loss in fair value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
with such estimates  we seek to closely match the duration of assets to the duration of liabilities 
when the estimated duration of assets and liabilities are similar  exposure to interest rate risk is minimized because a change in the value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities 
at december   the option adjusted duration of fixed maturity securities and short term investments were approximately  and the option adjusted duration of insurance liabilities was approximately the option adjusted duration compares the change in the value of an asset or liability with a change in interest rates 
this means that if interest rates in general increased  the value of our asset portfolio would decrease by approximately 
if interest rates were to increase by from their december  levels  our fixed maturity securities and short term investments net of the corresponding changes in the values of cost of policies purchased  cost of policies produced and insurance liabilities would decline in fair value by approximately million 
the calculations involved in our computer simulations incorporate numerous assumptions  require significant estimates and assume an immediate change in interest rates without any management of the investment portfolio in reaction to such change 
consequently  potential changes in the value of our financial instruments indicated by the simulations will likely be different from the actual changes experienced under given interest rate scenarios  and the differences may be material 
because our investments and liabilities are actively managed  actual losses could be less than those estimated above
