definitions gross profit 
gross profit is defined as gross operating revenues less fuel costs  conservation and unbundling costs  and taxes based on revenues that are passed through to customers and provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations 
fuel  conservation and unbundling costs along with taxes passed through to customers have no effect on results of operations and fluctuations in such costs distort the relationship of gross operating revenues between periods 
gross profit is the net revenue retained by the company for operating purposes 
summary of gross profits dollars in thousands electric natural gas propane gas contributing to variations in gross profit are the effects of seasonal weather conditions  the timing of rate increases  acquisitions and the migration of winter residents and tourists to florida during the winter season 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  which include operations and taxes other than income taxes  exclude fuel costs  conservation and unbundling costs  and taxes based on revenues that are passed through to customers

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the statement requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and the associated asset retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over its useful life 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  management believes the ultimate effect on the financial statements will be immaterial and that the impact on the regulated portion of the business  if any  would be an allowable item for recovery in the company s rates 
the florida public service commission fpsc is currently in the process of developing a rule on this treatment for regulated purposes and is currently proposing that the effects  if any  of the application of sfas no 
shall be revenue neutral in the rate making process 
the fpsc is also proposing that all differences between the application of sfas no 
and the method approved for regulated utilities will be recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities 
fpsc proposed rule development  accounting for asset retirement obligations under sfas no 
 rule no 
 fac the estimated cost of removal expenses for normal retirements related to regulated fixed assets is being reserved under current commission guidelines through the depreciation expense and accumulated reserves

financial accounting standard no 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for cost associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan

in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
since the company does not have any stock based compensation for employees at this time the statement will not presently have any effect on our financial statements 
other critical accounting policies and estimates rate regulated basis of accounting the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
and it is our most critical accounting policy 
in general  sfas no 
recognizes that accounting for rate regulated enterprises should reflect the relationship of costs and revenues introduced by rate regulation 
as a result  a regulated utility may defer recognition of a cost a regulatory asset or recognize an obligation a regulatory liability if it is probable that  through the rate making process  there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in revenues 
sfas no 
does not apply to the unregulated propane gas operations 
use of estimates management is often required to use its judgment and make assumptions in the calculation of estimates that affect the recorded amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in the financial statements of florida public utilities company 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition the company bills utility customers on a monthly cycle basis  however  the billing cycle periods for most customers do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting 
the company accrues estimated revenue for gas and electric customers not yet billed during the accounting period 
determination of unbilled revenue relies on the use of estimates  fuel purchases  and historical data 
effects of inflation the company s tariffs associated with its utility operating divisions provide for fuel clauses through which rates charged to customers are adjusted for changes in the cost of fuel on a reasonably current basis 
increases in other utility costs and expenses not otherwise offset by increases in revenues or reductions in other expenses could have an adverse effect on earnings due to the time lag associated with obtaining regulatory approval to recover such increased costs and expenses  and the uncertainty of whether regulatory commissions will allow full recovery of such increased costs and expenses 
forward looking information this report contains forward looking information that is intended to qualify for the safe harbor provided by the private securities litigation reform act of although the company believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
factors that could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated include  but are not limited to  the effects of regulatory actions  competition  future economic conditions and weather 
in october the company lost a large volume interruptible transportation customer in its natural gas segment 
this will cause annual gross profit to decrease by approximately  this will be offset by the addition of a large volume transportation customer that co nnected in the third quarter of that should be approaching full capacity during the first quarter of the estimated annual gross profit from this customer should be approximately  per year 
the company reduced revenue by  to allow for estimated over earnings in the electric segment 
this amount is subject to an fpsc audit  which will determine the actual amount of over earnings  and could result in a further reduction or increase to revenue in if the actual amount is determined to be different from the estimate 
the company determined that the natural gas segment did not have over earnings and a reduction was not made to revenue 
however  an fpsc audit could determine that over earnings does exist and may potentially result in an insignificant reduction to revenue in related to the company is also requesting approval for the goodwill and intangible assets  associated with our recent atlantic utilities regulated asset acquisition  to be allowed in rate base  w hich will reduce any potential natural gas over earnings amount discussed above 
recent events will have a significant unfavorable impact to earnings in upcoming financial periods 
the decline of the stock market has greatly decreased the value of the pension plan assets and will significantly increase pension expense in current actuarial estimates show pension expense increasing by approximately  in over industry events  the events of september   and the stock market decline  have resulted in greatly increased insurance costs 
effective september  insurance costs  excluding workers compensation and medical insurance  increased approximately  annually 
workers compensation insurance increased about  per year effective october  both increases will carry over into management also believes that medical costs will increase in and the company made revisions to the medical plan to help minimize the effect on operating income 
accounting  auditing  and tax service expenses could be increasing by an estimated  annually 
this is due to additional work requirements of recent regulations on the external auditors and an expanded internal audit program 
the company is exploring opportunities to reduce operating expenses to offset some of these unfavorable increases 
also  the company may seek rate relief for either the natural gas or electric segment in that will include recovering the additional expenses 
on july   the company entered into a gas transportation agreement gta with lake worth generation  llc lwg  that provided for i the construction of a natural gas pipeline lwg lateral by the company to a power generation project being developed by lwg on behalf of the city of lake worth  florida lwg project  ii the company s agreement to transport natural gas to the lwg project via the lwg lateral  and iii lwg s commitment to pay certain charges for the gas transportation services provided by the company over a year period 
the charges for gas transportation services were set at an amount that would permit the company to recover a return of on its undepreciated investment in the construction of the lwg lateral  plus recove r its operation and maintenance o m expenses 
lwg s obligation to pay for the gas transportation services was secured by an irrevocable letter of credit lc issued on july   and provided to the company in the amount of the initial estimated cost of construction of  the gta required monthly payments by lwg in the amount of  for the first year of the contract  adjusted annually thereafter to account for depreciation of the lwg lateral 
the gta also required lwg to increase the amount of the lc to cover the actual cost of construction of the lwg lateral  plus  in the fourth quarter of  lwg notified the company that  due to financial difficulties encountered by lwg and its contractors in connection with the lwg project  lwg would not be able to increase the lc  as required by the gta  or make monthly payments prospectively beginning in december for services performed in november the company  lwg and the city of la ke worth subsequently entered into a forbearance agreement  dated december   and an amended forbearance agreement  dated february  pursuant to the terms and conditions of these agreements  the city and the company are negotiating a new gas transportation agreement to replace the gta  that would provide for the company s agreement to provide gas transportation services to the city on the lwg lateral  subject to payment by the city of transportation charges that would be set initially to permit the company to recover a return of on its undepreciated investment in the construction of the lwg lateral  plus o m expenses 
the company s rates would be subject to adjustment in subsequent rate proceedings before the florida public service commission 
in the event that the company and the city execute a new gas transportation agreement by march   the company will receive payment for the shortfalls in monthly payments under the gta through march   plus interest  pl us a termination fee of million dollars  plus other expenses 
in the event that a new gas transportation agreement is not executed by march   the forbearance agreements permit the company to draw upon the lc and the gta is deemed terminated

pursuant to the agreement  the closing of this transaction is required to take place on or before march   and is currently scheduled for march  the city has agreed to pay the company  in cash at closing  with additional future consideration of  at an anticipated rate of  per year  commencing on or before february   and a like amount each year thereafter until february   when it is estimated that the company will receive a final payment from the city in an amount of approximately  the fair value of the consideration is approximately  the assets amount to approxima tely  or less than of the company s assets including water 
the water segment s operating income before income taxes was approximately of total operating income excluding income taxes before the reclassification to discontinued operations 
in the event the sale is consummated  the company would thereupon file an application with the fpsc for approval of the sale to a governmental authority  which  pursuant to florida statutes  must be approved by the commission as a matter of right

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial instruments held by the company were entered into for purposes other than for trading 
the company has market risk exposure only from the potential loss in fair value resulting from reasonably possible changes in interest rates 
the company has no exposure relating to commodity prices because the company  under its regulatory jurisdictions  is fully compensated for the actual costs of commodities primarily natural gas and electricity used in its operations 
any commodity price increases for propane are passed through monthly to propane customers as the fuel charge portion of their rate 
this can be performed due to the competition having similar increases that are customarily passed through to their customers 
none of the company s gas or electric contracts are accounted for using the fair value method of accounting 
while some of the company s contracts meet the definition of a derivative  the company has designated these contracts as normal purchases and sales under sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives 
the company has no exposure to equity risk  as it does not hold any equity instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to investments held for environmental costs 
these investments are fixed income debt securities whose carrying amounts are not materially different than fair value 
such investments mature from to and are expected to be held to maturity 
therefore  the company does not believe it has material market risk exposure related to these instruments 
the indentures governing the company s two first mortgage bond series outstanding contain make whole provisions  which are pre payment penalties that charge for lost interest  which render refinancing impracticable 
in  a hypothetical basis points decrease in the long term interest rate on  million debt would change the fair value from  million to  million 
changes in short term interest rates could have an effect on income depending on the balance borrowed on the variable rate line of credit 
on december  and  the company had  and  in short term debt  respectively 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in annual earnings by  and  respectively  based on the year end borrowings
