item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report 
overview we design  develop  license and market memory technologies used by the semiconductor industry and electronic product manufacturers 
we have developed a patented semiconductor memory technology  called t sram  that offers a combination of high density  low power consumption and high speed at performance and cost levels that other available memory technologies do not match 
we license this technology to companies that incorporate  or embed  memory on complex integrated circuits 
we also sell memory chips based on our t sram technologies 
the sale of our t sram memory chips supports the future development and marketing of our t sram technology to licensees 
using elements of our existing memory technology as a foundation  we completed development of our first memory chips incorporating our t sram technologies in the fourth quarter of through the second quarter of  almost all of our revenue was generated by product sales of our memory chips  however  we anticipate that licensing and royalty revenues will represent the majority of our future revenues 
we signed our first license agreement related to our t sram technologies at the end of the fourth quarter of and recognized licensing revenue from our t sram technologies for the first time in the first quarter of in late and  we introduced improved and alternative versions of the technology  t sram r  t stram m  and t sram q 
we generate revenue from intellectual property licensing  which consists of licensing revenue and royalty revenue 
our licensing revenue consists of fees paid for engineering development and engineering support services 
we are entitled to receive royalties under each of our licensing agreements when our licensees manufacture or sell products that incorporate our technology 
as of december   we had signed license agreements related to our t sram technologies with companies 
generally  we expect our total sales cycle  or the period from our initial discussion with a prospective licensee to our receipt of royalties from the licensee s use of our t sram technologies  to run from to months 
on august   we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding stock of atmos corporation 
atmos is a semiconductor memory company that focuses on creating high density  compiler generated embedded memory solutions for soc applications 
the total purchase price for the acquisition was approximately million including direct transaction costs of  the consideration paid to atmos shareholders consisted of million in cash and  shares of our common stock issued to certain atmos employees for a combined total fair value of million 
under the purchase method of accounting  the common stock was valued at per share using the company s average stock price for a five day period consisting of two days before  the day of and two days afterjune   the announcement date on which the number of shares to be issued became fixed 
the company loaned  to atmos under a promissory note due on july   which became non refundable upon completion of the acquisition  and has been included in the cash portion of the purchase price 
atmos now operates as our wholly owned subsidiary  and our financial statements for the year ended december  include the results of operations and financial condition of atmos from the date of acquisition 
revenue 
we generate three types of revenue licensing  royalty and product revenue 
prior to  almost all our revenue consisted of product revenue from the sale of memory chips 
since the beginning of  product revenue as a percentage of total revenue has declined each quarter while the percentage of our license and royalty revenues has grown each quarter 
in the third quarter of  for the first time  combined license and royalty revenue exceeded product revenue 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
in  we anticipate that product revenue will remain weak and licensing and royalty revenues will increase 
our license agreements involve long sales cycles  which makes it difficult to predict when the agreements will be signed 
we anticipate that licensing revenue will fluctuate from period to period and that it will be difficult to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue 
we believe that the amount of licensing revenues for any period is not necessarily indicative of results in any future period 
our future revenue results are subject to a number of factors  however  particularly those described in part i  item i  business risk factors 
we recognized licensing revenue for the first time in the first quarter of our licensing revenue consists of fees for providing circuit design  layout and design verification support to a licensee that is embedding our memory technology into its product 
for some licensees  we also provide engineering support services to assist commencement of production of their products that utilize t sram technologies 
licensing fees range from several hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars  depending on the scope and complexity of the development project  the licensee s rights and the royalties expected to be received under the agreement 
the licensee generally pays licensing fees in installments at the beginning of the license and upon achieving certain milestones 
all contracts entered into to date require us to meet performance specifications 
for contracts involving performance specifications that we have not met and for which we lack the historical experience to reasonably estimate the costs  we defer the recognition of revenue until the licensee manufactures products that meet the contract performance specifications and recognize revenue using the completed contract method 
fees collected prior to revenue recognition are recorded as deferred contract revenue 
however  if the contracts involve performance specifications that we have significant experience in meeting and the cost of contract completion can be reasonably estimated  we recognize revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed under the percentage of completion method 
labor costs incurred are used as a measure of progress towards completion 
under this accounting method  if the amount of revenue recognized exceeds the amount of billings to a customer  the excess amount is carried as an unbilled contract receivable 
this impacted our revenue for the first time in the second quarter of unbilled contract receivable was  and as of december  and december   respectively 
our license agreements are associated with lengthy and complicated engineering development projects  and so the completion of development and commencement of production may be difficult for us to predict 
from time to time  a licensee may cancel a project during the development phase 
the cancellation is not within our control and is often caused by changes in market conditions or the licensee s business 
generally  our contracts allow us to retain all payments that we have received or are entitled to collect for items and services provided before the cancellation occurs 
we will consider a project to have been canceled even in the absence of specific notice from our licensee if there has been no activity under the contract for a significant period  and we believe that completion of the contract is unlikely 
in this event  we recognize revenue in the amount of cash received  if we have performed a sufficient portion of the development services 
in  we recognized  of licensing revenue from cancelled projects compared to  in some of those cancelled contracts were entered into before the technical feasibility was established  therefore  costs associated with those contracts were already expensed prior to the recognition of revenue occurred 
each licensing agreement provides for royalty payments at a stated rate 
we negotiate royalty rates by taking into account such factors as the amount of licensing fees to be paid  the anticipated volume of the licensee s sales of products utilizing our technologies and the cost savings to be achieved by the licensee from using our technology 
our agreements require licensees to report the manufacture or sale of products that include our technology after the end of the quarter in which the sale or manufacture occurs 
we generally recognize royalties in the quarter in which we receive the licensee s report 
we recorded our first royalty revenue in the quarter ended december  the timing and level of royalties also are difficult to predict because they depend on the licensee s ability to market  produce and ship product that incorporates our technology 
under our licensing business model  our future revenue is tied to royalties on the production and sale of our licensees products 
many of these products are consumer products  such as electronic game players  for which demand is seasonal and generally highest in the fourth quarter  which we would report in the first quarter of the following year 
for a discussion of factors that could contribute to the fluctuation of our revenues  please see part i  item i  risk factors our lengthy licensing cycle and our licensees lengthy development cycles will make the operating results of our licensing business difficult to predict 
product sales are typically on a purchase order basis  with shipment of product from one to six months later 
provisions for estimated returns and to a lesser degree potential warranty liability are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
currently  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co  ltd  or tsmc  manufactures all of the memory chips that we sell 
our products are assembled and tested prior to shipment by independent  third party contractors 
we contract for manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and have no long term commitments for the supply of any of our memory chip products 
if we are unable to obtain manufacturing  assembly or testing services required to fill our customer orders for these products  our revenues from these products will decline substantially 
our memory chips are subject to competitive pricing pressure that might result in fluctuating gross profits  which we have experienced in the past 
prior to  we sold most of our memory chips to the personal computer market  which is seasonal  and experienced the strongest demand for these products in the fourth quarter each year 
from late to date  our memory chip sales have consisted primarily of t sram chips sold to customers in the communications equipment business  and we have not seen the effect of seasonal demand in the market 
the semiconductor industry is currently experiencing a difficult economic environment and downturn 
most of our memory chip sales are made to communications equipment manufacturers  which experienced a sharp economic downturn since our product revenues for were only of our product revenues for we have limited visibility regarding our customer s chip requirements in and anticipate further declines in product revenue 
a few customers account for a significant percentage of our total revenue 
for the year ended december   our two largest customers  nec and umc represented and of total revenue  respectively 
for the year ended december   our two largest customers  cisco systems  inc and nec represented and of total revenue  respectively 
in  our largest customer was cisco systems  which represented of our total revenue for the year 
no other customer accounted for more than of our revenue that year 
for information regarding revenues received by us in  and from customers residing in the united states or residing in a foreign country  please refer to note  segment information  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
for a discussion of factors that could contribute to the fluctuation of our revenues  please see part iv  item  risk factors we expect our revenue to be concentrated 
cost of revenue 
cost of product revenue consists primarily of costs associated with the manufacture  assembly and testing of our memory chip products by independent  third party contractors 
cost of licensing revenue consists primarily of engineering costs directly related to engineering development projects specified in agreements we have with licensees of our t sram technologies 
these projects typically include customization of t sram circuitry to enable embedding our memory on a licensee s integrated circuit and may include engineering support to assist in the commencement of production of a licensee s products 
if licensing revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method  the associated cost of licensing revenue is recognized in the period in which we incur the engineering expense 
if licensing revenue is recognized using the completed contract method  and to the extent that the amount of engineering cost does not exceed the amount of the related licensing revenue  this cost is deferred on a contract by contract basis from the time we have established technological feasibility of the product to be developed under the license 
technological feasibility is established when we have completed all activities necessary to demonstrate that the licensee s product can be produced to meet the performance specifications when incorporating our technology 
deferred costs are charged to cost of licensing revenue when the related revenue is recognized 
however  for contracts entered into prior to establishing technical feasibility  we do not defer related development costs related  but rather expense them in the period in which they are incurred 
consequently  upon completion of these contracts  we recognize the related revenues without any corresponding costs 
furthermore  there are no reported costs associated with royalty revenue 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee expenses  material costs for prototype and test units and expenses associated with engineering development software and equipment 
prior to  our research and development expenses were incurred primarily in support of the design  development and production of memory chips 
since changing our business model in  we have devoted our research and development efforts primarily to developing our t sram technologies and related licensing activities 
research and development expenses can also include development and design of variations of the t sram technologies for use in different manufacturing processes used by licensees and the development and testing of prototypes to prove the technical feasibility of embedding our memory designs in the licensees products 
we generally record engineering cost as research and development expense in the period incurred  except when the engineering cost is being deferred under a licensing agreement for which technological feasibility has been established 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  sales commissions to independent sales representatives and professional fees 
we pay commissions to our independent sales representatives on most of our sales of memory chips 
we have engaged one sales representative in japan  who receives a commission on licensing revenue generated from licensees that this sales representative introduces to us 
facility and occupancy costs are allocated to each functional department in proportion to its headcount 
we seek to leverage our licensing and co marketing relationships to promote our technology 
critical accounting policies use of estimates 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis we make these estimates based on our historical experience and on assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and reported results could differ under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following accounting policies are affected by estimates and judgments in the following manner revenue 
if a licensing contract involves performance specifications that we have significant experience in meeting and the cost of contract completion can be reasonably estimated  we recognize the revenue over the period in which the contract services are performed using the percentage of completion method 
we follow this method because we can obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the costs to perform the contracted services 
labor costs for the development of the licensee s design are estimated at the beginning of the contract 
as these costs are incurred  they are used as a measure of progress towards completion 
we have the ability to reasonably estimate labor cost on a contract to contract basis from our experience in developing prior licensee s designs 
during the contract performance period we review estimates of cost to complete the contracts as the contract progresses to completion and will revise our estimates of revenue and gross profit under the contract if we revise the estimations of the cost to complete 
our policy is to reflect any revision in the contract gross profit estimate in reported income for the period in which the facts giving rise to the revision become known 
inventory 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market  determined using the first in  first out method 
our policy is to write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to the extent the cost exceeds the estimated market value 
we base the estimate on our assumptions about historical and forecasted sales within twelve months period and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those assumed in our estimates  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our policy is to reflect any write down of inventory in reported income for the period in which the facts giving rise to the inventory write down become known 
impairment of long lived assets 
we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value 
we may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 
impairment of goodwill 
according to our accounting policy  we performed an annual review of goodwill recorded from the acquisition of atmos in august  during the fourth quarter of  and we found no impairment 
we will perform a similar review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
our impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses our estimates of revenue for the enterprise  driven by assumed market growth rates and assumed market segment share  and estimated costs as well as appropriate discount rates 
changes in our estimate could result in substantial charges for impairment of goodwill 
tax valuation allowance 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our consolidated balance sheet 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon weighted available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we must record a tax expense in our statement of operations 
management must make significant judgments to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our net deferred tax asset balance as of december  was million  net of the valuation allowance of million 
the deferred tax assets consist primarily of deductible temporary differences  tax credit carryforwards  and net operating losses 
results of operations the table set forth below shows our results of operations for the past three years  expressed as a percentage of revenue 
year ended december  net revenue product licensing 
royalty cost of net revenue product licensing gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative stock based compensation charge total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income provision for income taxes net income years ended december   and revenue 
in  total revenue increased to million from million representing a increase over this increase is primarily due to the significant growth in our revenues from licensing and royalty activities  which increased to million from million in a increase 
our royalty revenue increased from million in to million in  a increase 
in  royalties earned from the production of gamecube chips incorporating our t sram technology represented a significant portion of our revenue 
gamecube related revenue represented of total revenue in  an increase from of total revenue in because of increased sales of that product 
the royalty revenues from other licensees also increased in while we simultaneously increased and diversified our licensees and development projects in in  total revenue increased to million from million in due to the strong growth of our licensing revenue  which increased to million from million and in royalty revenue  which increased to million from insignificant levels 
most of the licensing and royalty revenue consisted of our engineering services associated with nec s development of chips for the nintendo gamecube video game console and royalties earned from the subsequent production of gamecube chips incorporating our t sram technology 
we also earned licensing revenue from a number of development projects with other licensees 
in  the majority of our revenue came from product sales of million  however  we recognized our first t sram technology licensing and royalty revenues  which totaled million 
during the years ended december   and  product sales were million  million and million  respectively 
sales of memory chips declined to of revenue from of revenue and of revenue as we shifted our primary focus from product sales to the licensing of our t sram technologies 
in addition  our product sales fell in due to significant downturns in the semiconductor industry and the communications equipment business  which is the primary market for our memory chips 
we expect continued weakness in product revenue in and do not anticipate increases until sales of communications equipment increase substantially 
gross profit 
in  gross profit increased to million because of the significant increase in licensing and royalty revenue  which represented million of the total gross profit for the year 
gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to in from due to the significantly higher proportion of licensing and royalty revenues  which have much higher gross profit margins than product revenues 
in  royalty gross profit as a percentage of royalty revenue was and licensing gross profit as a percentage of licensing revenue declined to compared to in in  of our licensing revenue came from the contracts accounted under the completed contract method compared to of licensing revenue in the majority of these contracts were entered into before technical feasibility was established  therefore  costs associated with these contracts were already expensed prior to the recognition of revenue occurring 
in  we recognized revenue on the last of these remaining completed contracts  and  therefore  expect the gross margin percentage from future licensing revenue to be lower than the current level because we will generally record revenues and costs in the same period under our current contracts 
in  gross profit increased to million from million in due to strong growth in licensing and royalty revenues  which contributed million to the total gross profit for the year 
gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to in from in due to the significantly higher proportion of licensing and royalty revenues 
in  licensing gross profit as a percentage of licensing revenue was and royalty gross profit as a percentage of royalty revenue was 
in addition  in  we recognized licensing and royalty revenue for the first time  which contributed  to gross profit for the year 
product gross margin as a percentage of product revenue declined to in compared to in this decline occurred because there were far fewer units of product shipped in  while total manufacturing fixed costs were similar in corresponding periods 
in  total gross profit was million of which gross profit from product revenue represented million 
in  our decision to shift our focus to the sale of t sram memory chips to communications equipment manufacturers resulted in lower unit shipments of memory chips but higher selling prices and gross margins than we had realized from sales of our other memory chip products in prior years 
research and development 
in  research and development expense increased to million due to additions to the engineering staff from additional hiring and our acquisition of atmos in august to support to our expanded licensing activities 
atmos research and development expenses represented approximately  in engineering expense incurred in and recorded as cost of license revenue was million 
in  research and development expense increased to million due to additions to the engineering staff  and expanded engineering support to our licensing activities 
we also established an engineering design center in seoul  korea in june engineering expense incurred in and recorded as cost of license revenue was  research and development expense was million in mainly to support continued development of the t sram technology and our expanding licensing activities 
we recorded approximately  of engineering expense  incurred in  as cost of license revenue 
research and development expenses as a percent of total revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in as increases in administrative  intellectual property sales and marketing staff expenses were partially offset by lower product sales commissions 
in  selling  general and administrative expense increased to million  an increase of approximately from the preceding year 
the increase in reflected the addition of administrative  sales and marketing staff and the expansion of intellectual property marketing activities 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by from the prior year to million in due to the expansion of our sales and marketing activities in selling memory chips and licensing our technology 
in addition  our rent and facility expense increased with our july move into additional space in our existing headquarters building 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
interest and other income 
interest income reflects interest earned on average cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments 
interest income was  million and million in   and  respectively 
the fluctuation in interest income levels corresponds to differences in average cash and investment balances for the periods and the interest rates  which declined significantly in in  interest income increased due to higher average cash balances  which included proceeds from our july initial public offering  and was partially offset by a decline in interest rates 
interest income in included interest earned on cash received from a preferred stock financing of million in may and the receipt of million of contract fee payments during we incurred no interest expense in  and interest and other income as a percent of total revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
deferred stock based compensation cost to employees 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately  million  and million  respectively 
the deferred compensation cost represented the shares of common stock issued to certain employees of atmos that were subject to vesting requirements related to the acquisition of atmos  which is being amortized over the vesting period of months using the graded vesting method 
during the year ended december   we recorded amortization expense of  related to deferred compensation from those shares 
the deferred compensation recorded during the years ended and represented the difference between the grant price and the fair market value of the common stock for financial statement reporting purposes during the period in which the options were granted 
deferred compensation expense is being amortized using the graded vesting method  in accordance with sfas no 
and fasb interpretation no 
 over the vesting period of each respective option  generally four years 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded amortization expense of  million and million  respectively  related to the deferred compensation arising from the difference in stock options grant price and fair value of our common stock 
provision for income taxes 
provisions for income taxes of approximately million   and  were recorded in  and  respectively 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes and approximately  for state tax purposes that we expect to be available to reduce future income tax liabilities to the extent permitted under federal and applicable state income tax laws 
those net operating losses are subject to an annual limitation of approximately million pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
those net operating loss carry forwards expire from to in  we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will be less than the full corporate tax rate but higher than for financial reporting purposes 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
as of the same date  the company had total working capital of million 
in july  the company completed the sale of a total of  shares of common stock in its initial public offering 
the company realized total net proceeds of approximately million upon the close of the ipo 
our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs 
we believe that our current focus on licensing and royalty revenues and reduced levels of memory chip sales has lessened the volatility of our business and generally have enabled us to steadily improve our cash position 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended   and  respectively 
in  net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net income of million  non cash charge of depreciation and amortization for million 
the increases in those items were reduced by increases in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  mainly due to recording deferred tax assets for million related to a realization of tax benefits by utilizing net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  reductions of net cash provided by operating activities included decreases in deferred revenue of million and accounts payable of million 
deferred revenue decreased in due to the recognition of the prepaid royalties and licensing revenues recognized under the completed contract method of accounting during in  net cash provided by operating activities was million  consisting principally of net profit of million plus a non cash charge of million for stock based compensation 
in addition  we reduced accounts receivable by million but decreased deferred revenue by million 
the reduction in deferred revenue in resulted from the recognition of licensing and prepaid royalty revenues in excess of additional license fees collected from our customers 
net cash provided by operating activities in was principally represented by our net profit of million plus a non cash charge of million for stock based compensation 
in addition  in  we received license fees of million  which were recorded as deferred revenue and which were partially offset by the recognition of million of license revenue 
cash generated by operations in also was offset by an inventory increase of million 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million  and  for the years ended  and  respectively 
in  investing activities principally related to cash payments totaling million for the acquisition of amtos and investing in short term and long term marketable securities of million  net 
additionally  we purchased million of property and equipment in  which consisted principally of engineering design software 
in  investing activities consisted mainly of engineering design software purchases and the establishment of our engineering design center in korea 
in addition  in  we invested in short term marketable securities of million  net 
net cash provided by financing activities were million  million  and million for the years ended  and in  financing activities consisted primarily of cash received upon the issuance of common stock for  in connection with the exercise of options 
in  we received total net proceeds of million upon the close of our ipo 
in addition  we received million from the exercise of warrants and common stock options 
in  we received million from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and million from the exercise of common stock options and a warrant 
our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter  depending on numerous factors  including level and timing of licensing  royalty and memory chip sales revenues  cost  timing and success of technology development efforts  market acceptance of our existing and future technologies and products  competing technological and market developments  cost of maintaining and enforcing patent claims and intellectual property rights  and variations in manufacturing yields  materials costs and other manufacturing risks  costs of acquiring other businesses and integrating the acquired operations 
we expect that the net proceeds of our initial public offering  together with our existing capital and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we expect that a licensing business such as ours generally will require less cash to support operations after multiple licensees begin to ship products and pay royalties 
however  we cannot be certain that we will not require additional financing at some point in time 
should our cash resources prove inadequate  we might need to raise additional funding through public or private financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could have a material  adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
lease commitments and off balance sheet financing the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payment due by period total less than year years years over years operating lease obligations    capital lease obligations the company did not have any unconditional purchase obligations as of december  recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
we have adopted sfas the purchase method of accounting was used for the acquisition of atmos 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after march  sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in addition  the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles 
we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and no impairment changes were recorded as of december  in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is required to be applied starting with years beginning after december  sfas requires  amongst other things  the application model for long lived assets that are impaired or to be disposed of by sale

 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the provisions of sfas no 
are to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the effect of adoption of sfas no 
is dependent on our related activities subsequent to the date of adoption 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas amends sfas accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we are required to adopt the interim disclosure provisions for financial reports in its fiscal quarter ended march  we will continue to account for stock based compensation under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees using the intrinsic value method 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
fin also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued 
the recognition provisions of fin are effective for any guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no

eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on its results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussion of market interest rate risk our investment portfolio consists of money market funds  corporate backed debt obligations and mortgage backed government obligations generally due within one year 
our primary objective with its investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
in accordance with our investment policy  we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities  which approximate million as of december   and have an average interest rate of approximately  are subject to interest rate risks 
however  based on the investment portfolio contents and our ability to hold these investments until maturity  we believe that if a significant change in interest rates were to occur  it would not have a material effect on our financial condition
