the company s net sales and gross margins gross profit as a percentage of net sales vary depending on the mix of business among the company s products 
historically  gross margins have been highest in bulk alcohol products and premium branded spirits and lower in bottling operations and vinegar and cooking wine operations 
within its bottling operations  sales and gross margins have varied substantially based upon the mix of business from the company s type a and type b bottling customers 
type a bottling customers pay the company to purchase their raw materials and these costs are passed through to the customer 
type b bottling customers supply their own raw materials and are only charged for bottling charges 
although gross profit per case for the company s type a and type b bottling customers is approximately equal  given the same case volume  net sales and cost of goods sold with respect to products bottled for type a bottling customers are higher  and gross margins are lower  than for type b bottling customers 
as a result  significant fluctuations in volume of type a bottling customers can distort the company s gross margin 
the size and timing of purchase orders and product shipments can cause operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  particularly since some customers purchase bulk alcohol products in significant quantities or place significant orders for contract bottling services  distilled spirits  vinegar and cooking wine 
additionally  some company products generate higher profit margins than others  and changes in the company s product mix will therefore cause gross margins to fluctuate 
certain aspects of the company s business are also seasonal  with increased demand for the company s contract bottling services from april to october and increased production of the company s bulk alcohol products from november to june  corresponding to the florida citrus harvest 
as a result of these factors  the company s operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
net sales represent the company s gross sales less excise taxes 
excise taxes are generally payable on products bottled by the company 
in addition  excise taxes are payable on sales of industrial alcohol to certain customers 
accordingly  excise taxes vary from period to period depending upon the company s product and customer mix

financial liquidity and capital resources general the company s principal use of cash in its operating activities is for purchasing raw materials to be used in its manufacturing operations and purchasing imported products for its premium branded spirits business 
the company s source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from operations and its line of credit 
some of the company s manufacturing operations are seasonal and the company s borrowings on its line of credit vary during the year 
for example  the company uses citrus molasses as its primary raw material in the production of citrus brandy and spirits at its two florida distilleries 
the company buys citrus molasses  a byproduct of citrus juice production  from manufacturers of citrus juice concentrate during the citrus harvest  which generally runs from november to june 
the company generally begins purchasing citrus molasses in november and manufactures and builds inventory of citrus brandy and spirits 
the company manufactures and builds inventory while raw materials are available due to the short life of the citrus molasses it purchases 
another seasonal business of the company is its contract bottling services 
demand for contract bottling services is highest from april through october 
management believes that cash provided by its operating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfy its working capital  liquidity and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both its short term and long term capital needs 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in was million  which resulted from million in net income adjusted for noncash items  and a million net change in operating assets and liabilities

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policy is subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company has goodwill and intangible assets associated with business acquisitions 
the company reviews these assets for impairment annually and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these assets below their carrying value 
if the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying value  then an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
see recent accounting pronouncements  below 
recent accounting pronouncements as of march   the company adopted financial accounting standards board intepretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires a guarantor to recognize at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value or market value  of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee and must disclose the information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception for the fair value of the guarantor s obligation does not apply to guarantees issued between entities under common control and therefore is not applicable to the company 
management believes that this standard does not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  for certain entities that do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities wihout additional subordinated financial support from other parties or in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of fin will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
fin applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which the company obtains an interest after that date 
fin was effective july  to variable interest entities in which the company holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  management believes this standard does not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations

kenneth pincourt  jr  its founder  chairman and chief executive officer
