item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  bad debts  sales returns  excess and obsolete inventory  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements customer incentives we record reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs  including special pricing agreements  price protection for our distributors  promotions  and other volume related rebate programs 
such reductions to revenue are estimates  which are based on a number of factors  including our assumptions related to customer redemption rates  sales volumes  and inventory levels at our distributors 
if actual results differ from our original assumptions  revisions are made to our estimates that could result in additional reductions to our reported revenue in the period the revisions are made 
additionally  if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase the level of customer incentive offerings that could result in an incremental reduction of revenue in the period in which we offer the incentive 
bad debts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
additionally  we have a significant concentration of accounts receivable with our largest distributor  graybar electric company  inc as of december   graybar accounted for of our total accounts receivable 
if graybar s financial condition were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments to us  it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
sales returns we maintain allowances for estimated sales returns 
while we have distribution agreements with our largest distributors that limit the amount of sales returns on active products  we generally allow unlimited returns of products that we discontinue 
accordingly  the timing and amount of revisions to our estimates for sales returns is largely influenced by our decisions to discontinue product lines and our ability to predict the inventory levels of such products at our largest distributors 
revisions to these estimates have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported amount of revenue in the period in which the revisions are made 
we generally do not accept product returns from our direct dealers unless the product is damaged 
excess and obsolete inventory we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
our assessment of market value is determined by  among other things  historical and forecasted sales activity  the condition of specific inventory items  and competitive pricing considerations 
when the assessed market value is less than the historical cost  provision is made in the financial statements to write down the carrying amount of the respective inventory items to market value 
if actual results are less favorable than our original assumptions for determining market value  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which begin on page f of this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states
