item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
overview the demand for the company s products and services is dependent upon a number of factors  including the economic condition of the company s customers and markets  the age and state of repair of the vessels operated by the company s customers and the relative cost to construct a new vessel as compared with repairing an older vessel 
a significant portion of the company s historical revenues has been derived from customers in the offshore oil and gas industry 
accordingly  demand for the company s products and services has been adversely impacted since the latter part of by decreased activity in the offshore oil and gas industry 
during  the company began to experience a modest increase in demand for products and services due to the upturn in activity in the offshore oil and gas industry 
during the fourth quarter of and throughout  weakness in the economy in general  and the offshore oil and gas industry in particular  resulted in decreased demand and adversely affected the company s financial performance 
the company did experience an increase in demand for repair and conversion services in the first quarter of due to seasonal workload patterns  however  the company experienced significant decreased demand for repair and conversion services in the last three quarters of the company believes that there is little or no visibility at this time into the repair market for however  the company anticipates an increase in the repair and conversion market in the first quarter of when  as a result of seasonality  the market traditionally improves and as a result of the opening of the new repair and conversion facility in amelia  louisiana 
although recent improved drydock utilization rates appear to support this anticipation  it is unclear at this time how long this trend will continue 
bid activity in the vessel construction segment improved during compared to the company s backlog  excluding unexercised options  was million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase in backlog is primarily attributable to the award of a million contract by the corps of engineers for the construction of three towboats and a million contract by the alaska marine highway system for a foot ferry 
the contract with the corps of engineers also includes an option  exercisable by the customer  for one additional towboat valued at million 
in addition  the company is currently in discussion and negotiations with various customers for new vessel construction contracts and remains cautiously optimistic that these projects will add to our backlog in the near future 
the company believes that the impact of the new contract awards and additional potential future projects will become more evident in operating results 
the company is engaged in various types of construction under contracts that generally range from one month to months in duration 
the company uses the percentage of completion method of accounting and therefore  takes into account the estimated costs  estimated earnings and revenue to date on fixed price contracts not yet completed 
the amount of revenue recognized is equal to the portion of the total contract price that the labor hours incurred to date bears to the estimated total labor hours  based on current estimates to complete 
this method is used because management considers expended labor hours to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
revenues from cost plus fee contracts are recognized on the basis of cost incurred during the period plus the fee earned 
most of the contracts entered into by the company for new vessel construction  whether commercial or governmental  are fixed price contracts under which the company retains all cost savings on completed contracts but is liable for all cost overruns 
the company develops its bids for a fixed price project by estimating the amount of labor hours and the cost of materials necessary to complete the project and then bids such projects in order to achieve a sufficient profit margin to justify the allocation of its resources to such project 
the company s revenues therefore may fluctuate from period to period based on  among other things  the aggregate amount of materials used in projects during a period and whether the customer provides materials and equipment 
the company generally performs conversion and repair services on the basis of cost plus fee arrangements pursuant to which the customer pays a negotiated labor rate for labor hours spent on the project as well as the cost of materials plus a margin on materials purchased 
recent events internal expansion on october   the company purchased acres of land in amelia  louisiana for million 
the land is strategically located on the bayou boeuf intracoastal waterway approximately miles from the gulf of mexico and is within one mile of the other existing amelia facility 
approximately acres of the property have been developed as a repair and conversion facility 
the development includes clearing land  grubbing  dredging  installation of a steel sheet pile bulkhead system  dry excavation  construction of a  square foot building  other infrastructure improvements and outfitting with tools and equipment at an anticipated total cost of approximately million 
as of december   the company had incurred million developing the facility 
in february  the company moved its two largest drydocks to the facility and commenced operations 
the facility allows the company to handle vessels with deeper drafts than the company has historically been able to service at its other facilities 
in addition  the infrastructure improvements also allow for the potential future development of the facility to accommodate vessel construction should the market so dictate 
in addition  during  the company completed construction of an expansion of a fabrication building at the morgan city yard at a cost of approximately  which increased the company s enclosed building space by approximately  square feet and increased capabilities for pre fabricated components and modular construction techniques 
stockholder rights plan during may  the company adopted a rights plan 
the rights plan is intended to protect stockholder interests in the event the company becomes the subject of a takeover initiative that the company s board of directors believes could deny the company s stockholders the full value of their investment 
the adoption of the rights plan is intended as a means to guard against abusive takeover tactics and is not in response to any particular proposal 
the plan does not prohibit the board from considering any offer that it considers advantageous to stockholders 
under the plan  the company declared and paid a dividend on june  of one right for each share of the company s common stock held by stockholders of record on june  each right initially entitles the company s stockholders to purchase one one thousandth of a share of the company s preferred stock for per one one thousandth  subject to adjustment 
however  if a person acquires  or commences a tender offer that would result in ownership of  percent or more of the company s outstanding common stock while the plan remains in place  then  unless the company redeems the rights for per right  the rights will become exercisable by all rights holders except the acquiring person or group for shares of the company s common stock or of the acquiring person having a market value of twice the purchase price of the rights 
the rights will expire on may   unless redeemed or exchanged by the company at an earlier date 
a description and the terms of the rights are set forth in a rights agreement  dated may   between the company and american stock transfer trust company  which was filed as exhibit to the company s registration statement on form a filed may  the rights will initially trade with shares of the company s common stock and will have no impact on the way in which the company s shares are traded 
there are currently no separate certificates evidencing the rights  and there is no market for the rights

vessel construction hours decreased compared to while repair and conversion hours were lower by when compared to vessel construction revenue was of total revenue compared to for and repair and conversion revenue was of total revenue compared to in for  of revenue was energy related  was government and was other commercial 
this compares to energy  government and other commercial in gross profit was million of revenue for as compared to gross profit of million of revenue for vessel construction gross profit decreased million  or  for compared to million for repair and conversion gross profit decreased million  or  for compared to million for vessel construction gross profit was negatively impacted by a charge of approximately  related to anticipated losses on a commercial contract in progress for four vessels 
complexities in the hull structures of these vessels made prior learning curve assumptions less achievable 
as a result  gross profit and net income will continue to be negatively impacted until this contract s scheduled completion in the second quarter of in addition  the decline in the gross profit of both segments was attributable to a decrease in production hours as discussed above due to less demand for vessel construction and repair and conversion jobs 
vessel construction gross profit margins decreased to for  compared to gross profit margins of for repair and conversion gross profits margins were for  compared to gross profit margins of for selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased  or  to million of revenue for  as compared to million of revenue for the decrease in sg a was due primarily to the elimination of goodwill amortization expense due to the adoption of sfas no

the company had income tax expense of  for  compared to income taxes of million for the decrease in income tax expense is primarily attributable to the decrease in income from operations as discussed above 
during the second quarter of  the company completed the two step process of the transitional goodwill impairment test prescribed in sfas no 
with respect to existing goodwill as discussed in note to the financial statements 
the transitional goodwill impairment test resulted in the company recognizing a non cash transitional goodwill impairment charge of million related entirely to the orange shipbuilding reporting unit 
as required by sfas no 
 the million charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended december  there was no income tax effect on the impairment charge as the charge related to non deductible goodwill 
the fair value of the orange shipbuilding reporting unit was determined based on the excess earnings return on assets treasury valuation method 
the circumstance leading to the goodwill impairment was a decline in market conditions since the acquisition of this reporting unit 
this circumstance caused lower than expected operating profits and cash flows 
the recording of this non cash charge for the impairment of goodwill resulted in a net loss of million for year ended december  compared to year ended december  during the year ended december   the company generated revenue of million  an increase of approximately million  or  compared to million generated for the increase was due to a million increase in vessel construction revenue to million for compared to million for the increase was partially offset by a million decrease in repair and conversion revenue to million for  compared to million for the increase in vessel construction revenue was attributable to the increase in vessel construction production hours by during compared to this was due to greater demand for vessel construction jobs during the first three quarters of  the fact that the construction of the drydock by production personnel during absorbed hours during that period which could otherwise have been available for billable work  and the nature of the jobs during required more material and equipment compared to jobs during the decrease in repair and conversion revenue during compared to was primarily attributable to decreased demand for repair and conversion services during the fourth quarter of due to decreased offshore oil and gas activity and the fact that two conversion jobs in progress during required more material and equipment as compared to projects completed or in progress during repair and conversion hours decreased by during compared to vessel construction revenue was of total revenue compared to for and repair and conversion revenue was of total revenue compared to in for  of revenue was energy related  was government and was other commercial

the decrease in repair and conversion gross profit was primarily due to the fact that jobs during were more profitable than jobs during and the decrease in repair and conversion hours during primarily in the fourth quarter as compared to vessel construction gross profit margins decreased to for  compared to gross profit margins of for primarily due to some jobs in being more material intensive and some jobs in having lower profit margins due to greater job cost

the company believes that it has secured adequate bonding for potential future job prospects 
although the company believes that it will be able to obtain contract bid and performance bonds  letters of credit  and similar obligations on terms it regards as acceptable  there can be no assurance it will be successful in doing so 
in addition  the cost of obtaining such bonds  letters of credit and similar obligations has increased and may continue to increase 
as of december   the company had an outstanding commitment of million for the construction of its new repair and conversion facility in amelia  louisiana 
substantially all of this commitment is expected to be paid within the next twelve months 
the company s backlog  excluding unexercised options  was million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase in backlog is primarily attributable to the award of a million contract by the corps of engineers for the construction of three towboats

the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
due to the relatively low levels of inflation experienced in fiscal   and  inflation did not have a significant effect on the results of the company in those fiscal years 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts and long lived assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company is engaged in various types of construction under long term construction contracts 
the company s financial statements have been prepared using the percentage of completion method of accounting and  therefore  take into account the estimated cost  estimated earnings and revenue to date on contracts not yet completed 
the amount of revenue recognized is equal to the portion of the total contract price that the labor hours incurred to date bears to the estimated total labor hour  based on current estimates to complete 
contract costs include all direct material  labor  and subcontracting cost  and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs  depreciation  and insurance costs 
indirect costs are allocated to contracts on the basis of direct labor charges 
revisions in estimates of cost and earnings during the course of the work are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts which required the revision become known 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
significant changes in estimates of cost due to adverse market conditions or poor contract performance could affect estimated gross profit  possibly resulting in a contract loss 
the company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on an evaluation of individual customer financial strength  current market conditions  and other information 
if the company s evaluation of its significant customers and debtors creditworthiness should change or prove incorrect  then the company may have to recognize additional allowances in the period that it identifies the risk of loss 
long lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values can be recovered through projected cash flows and operating results over their remaining lives 
any impairment of the asset is recognized when it is probable that such future undiscounted cash flows will be less than the carrying value of the asset 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company is required to test the goodwill of its reporting units for impairment on at least an annual basis 
currently  the company s only goodwill is that associated with its orange shipbuilding operations 
the company s annual test will be performed in the first quarter of  and the company has not yet completed the test 
in addition to the annual review  the company must assess whether goodwill is impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than fair value 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends
