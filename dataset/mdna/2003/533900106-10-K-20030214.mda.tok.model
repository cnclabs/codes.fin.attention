all future employee stock option grants beginning january  will be expensed over the stock option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted 
the company expects minimal financial impact in from the adoption of this accounting methodology 
if the number of options granted in is comparable to  the expected impact would be approximately per share for the company estimates the impact per share would increase annually over the next several years and level off at approximately per share by this estimate assumes that the number and the fair value of options granted is similar for all years

the effective date for this interpretation will be july  the company has not yet determined the impact  if any  this interpretation will have on the financial statements of the company 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make estimates and assumptions 
the company believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations 
legal and tax contingencies the company  like other manufacturers  is subject from time to time to a variety of civil and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
such claims and litigation include  without limitation  product liability claims and health  safety and environmental claims  some of which relate to cases alleging asbestos and manganese induced illnesses 
the costs associated with these claims are predominantly defense costs  which are recognized in the periods incurred 
insurance reimbursements mitigate these costs and  where reimbursements are probable  they are recognized in the applicable period 
with respect to costs other than defense costs ie for liability and or settlement or other resolution  reserves are recorded when it is probable that the contingencies will have an unfavorable outcome 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost  after a review of the facts with management and counsel and taking into account past experience 
if an unfavorable outcome is determined to be reasonably possible but not probable  or if the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated  disclosure is provided in lieu of reserves 
many of the current cases are in preliminary procedural stages and insufficient information exists upon which judgments can be made as to the validity or ultimate disposition of such actions 
therefore  a range of possible losses cannot be made at this time 
reserves are adjusted as facts and circumstances change  and related management assessments of the underlying merits and the likelihood of outcomes change 
moreover  reserves only cover identified and or asserted claims 
future claims could  therefore  give rise to increases to such reserves 
see note m to the consolidated financial statements and the legal proceedings section of the annual report on form k for further discussion of legal contingencies 
the company often faces challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  the company records reserves for probable exposures 
based on evaluation of those tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent the company were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of recorded reserves  the effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of non us subsidiaries  as such funds are deemed permanently reinvested 
as of december   the company has approximately million of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax loss and credit carryforwards which will reduce taxable income in future years 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  the company assesses whether it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
at december   a valuation allowance of million has been recorded against these deferred tax assets based on this assessment 
the company believes it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of net deferred tax asset considered realizable could be increased or reduced in the future if the company s assessment of future taxable income or tax planning strategies changes 
pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plan in the united states 
a significant element in determining the company s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets and the market related value of plan assets 
the market related value of plan assets can be determined by either fair value or a calculated value recognizing changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years 
the company used fair values at december for the market related value of plan assets 
the company has assumed the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to the market value of plan assets 
this produces the expected return on plan assets included in pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the amortization of the net deferral of past losses will increase future pension expense 
the plan assets have earned a rate of return substantially less than in the last two years 
the company anticipates lowering the expected rate of return on plan assets to approximately for as a result  future pension expense will increase 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used for plan liabilities 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
decreases in discount rates and lower expected returns on plan assets over the past two years will materially affect pension expense in the company estimates pension expense will increase by million in inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
for domestic inventories  cost is determined principally by the last in  first out lifo method  and for non us inventories  cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
the valuation of lifo inventories is made at the end of each year based on inventory levels and costs at that time 
the excess of current cost over lifo cost amounted to million at december  the company reviews the net realizable value of inventory in detail on an on going basis  with consideration given to deterioration  obsolescence and other factors 
if actual market conditions differ from those projected by management  and the company s estimates prove to be inaccurate  write downs or adjustments to cost of sales may be required 
accounts receivable and allowances the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the failure of its customers to make required payments for products delivered 
the company estimates this allowance based on knowledge of the financial condition of customers  review of historical receivables and reserve trends and other pertinent information 
if the financial condition of customers deteriorates or an unfavorable trend in receivable collections is experienced in the future  additional allowances may be required 
certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including those portions of this management s discussion and analysis that refer to the future may contain forward looking statements that are not historical facts 
those statements are forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of all such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
such forward looking statements  and the company s future performance  operating results  financial position and liquidity  are subject to a variety of factors that could materially affect future results  including competition 
the company operates in a highly competitive global environment and is subject to a variety of competitive factors such as pricing  the actions and strength of its competitors  and the company s ability to maintain its position as a recognized leader in welding technology 
the intensity of foreign competition is substantially affected by fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar against other currencies 
the company s competitive position could also be adversely affected should new or emerging entrants become more active in the arc welding business 
economic and market conditions 
the company is subject to general economic  business and industry conditions which can adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company s revenues and profits depend significantly on the overall demand for arc welding and cutting products 
capital spending in the manufacturing and other industrial sectors can adversely affect the company s results of operations 
if current economic and market conditions do not improve  the company s results of operations could continue to be adversely affected 
international markets 
the company s long term strategy is to increase its share in growing international markets  particularly asia  latin america  central europe and other developing markets 
however  there can be no certainty that the company will be successful in its expansion efforts 
the company is subject to the currency risks of doing business abroad  and the possible effects of international terrorism and hostilities 
moreover  international expansion poses challenging demands within the company s infrastructure 
cyclicality and maturity of the welding and cutting industry 
the united states arc welding and cutting industry is both mature and cyclical 
the growth of the domestic arc welding and cutting industry has been and continues to be constrained by numerous factors  including increased cost of steel due to regulatory tariffs and the substitution of plastics and other materials in place of fabricated metal parts in many products and structures 
increased offshore production of fabricated steel structures has also decreased the domestic demand for arc welding and cutting products in the company s largest market 
litigation 
the company  like other manufacturers  is subject in the us market to a variety of product liability lawsuits and potential lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business 
while past experience has generally shown these cases to be immaterial  product liability cases in the us continue to increase generally  with unpredictable results 
operating factors 
the company is highly dependent on its skilled workforce and efficient production facilities  which could be adversely affected by its labor relations  business interruptions and short term or long term interruptions in the availability of supplies or raw materials or in transportation of finished goods 
research and development 
the company s continued success depends  in part  on its ability to continue to meet customer welding needs through the introduction of new products and the enhancement of existing product design and performance characteristics 
there can be no assurances that new products or product improvements  once developed  will meet with customer acceptance and contribute positively to the operating results of the company  or that product development will continue at a pace to sustain future growth 
the above list of factors that could materially affect the company s future results is not all inclusive 
any forward looking statements reflect only the beliefs of the company or its management at the time the statement is made 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company s primary financial market risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
the company manages these risks by using derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
during  the principal transactions hedged were intercompany loans and intercompany purchases 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts and the offsetting losses and gains on hedged transactions are reflected in the income statement 
at december   the company had approximately million notional amount of foreign exchange contracts which primarily hedged recorded balance sheet exposures or intercompany purchases 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency rates on the company s open foreign exchange contracts at december  would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
from time to time  the company uses various hedging arrangements to manage the company s exposure to price risk from commodity purchases 
the primary commodities hedged are aluminum and copper 
these hedging arrangements have the effect of locking in for specified periods at predetermined prices or ranges of prices the prices the company will pay for the volume to which the hedge relates 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in commodity prices on the company s open commodity futures at december   would not materially affect the company s financial statements 
the fair value of the company s cash and cash equivalents at december   approximated carrying value due to its short term duration
