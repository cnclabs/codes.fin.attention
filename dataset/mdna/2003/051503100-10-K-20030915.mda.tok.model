item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
inventory valuation inventory is written down for estimated surplus and discontinued inventory items 
the amount of the write down is determined by analyzing historical and projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
changes in sales volumes due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance is established for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
the required allowance is determined by reviewing customer accounts and making estimates of amounts that may be uncollectible 
factors considered in determining the amount of the reserve include the age of the receivable  the financial condition of the customer  general business  economic and political conditions  and other relevant facts and circumstances 
unexpected changes in the aforementioned factors would result in materially different amounts for this item
