overview proxim corporation is the company created by the march  merger of proxim  inc and western multiplex corporation 
the results for include the financial results of western multiplex for the period from january  to december   the results of the former proxim  inc for the period from march  to december   and the results of the wlan systems business of agere for the period from august  to december   in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for accounting for business combinations 
western multiplex was founded in in sunnyvale  california as a vendor of radio components and related services 
in  western multiplex changed its strategy  becoming a designer and manufacturer of broadband wireless systems and launched our lynx broadband wireless products 
these point to point systems are primarily used by wireless operators to connect their base stations to other base stations and to existing wire line networks 
in  western multiplex introduced its tsunami point to point broadband wireless systems  which primarily enable service providers  businesses and other enterprises to expand or establish private networks by bridging internet traffic among multiple facilities 
based on western multiplex s core technologies and the technology acquired through its purchase of wirelesshome corporation in march  western multiplex has developed point to multipoint systems that enable service providers  businesses and other enterprises to connect multiple facilities within a geographic area to a central hub 
western multiplex began shipping its first generation of these products at the end of the fourth quarter of in march  western multiplex merged with proxim  inc located in sunnyvale  california which designs  manufactures and markets high performance wlan and building to building network products based on rf technology and changed the western multiplex name to proxim corporation 
in april  we acquired nband communications inc  a start up developer of next generation advanced application specific integrated circuits  or asics technology 
on august   we completed our acquisition of the wlan systems business of agere systems  including its orinoco product line  for million in cash 
to finance the acquisition  warburg pincus private equity viii  lp  broadview capital partners lp and affiliated entities agreed to collectively invest million in the company 
these investors received  shares of redeemable convertible series a preferred stock preferred stock in the amount of approximately million  with a conversion price of approximately per share  and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of common stock valued at million 
the value of the warrants was recorded as a reduction of the preferred stock carrying value and recorded as additional paid in capital 
a deemed preferred stock dividend representing the beneficial conversion feature of the preferred stock of million was reflected in the determination of the loss attributable to common stockholders 
the investors were also issued million of convertible notes 
upon the receipt of approval of our stockholders at a special meeting held on october   the notes issued to these investors were converted into  shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of common stock valued at million 
the warrants were recorded as a reduction of the preferred stock carrying value and recorded as additional paid in capital in the quarter ended december  in total  the investors were granted warrants to acquire  shares of common stock for approximately per share valued at million 
the preferred stock and warrants issued to the investors represent approximately of our outstanding common stock on an as converted and as exercised basis including dividends 
in addition  in connection with the transaction  we entered into a patent cross license agreement and settled all outstanding patent related litigation with agere  and have entered into a three year strategic supply agreement  pursuant to which agere will provide chips  modules and cards to us at specified prices 

table of contents the financial statements include the results of acquired subsidiaries from their respective dates of acquisition 
revenue 
we generate revenue primarily from the sale of our lynx and tsunami systems for our wwan product line  and the sale of a standards based products  acquired in the proxim  inc acquisition  and orinoco products acquired from agere  for our wlan product line 
we introduced the tsunami products during the fourth quarter of while our tsunami products and lynx products have similar pricing for comparable models  our lynx product line contributes the largest part of our revenue 
we began selling our tsunami point to multipoint systems in we also generate a small percentage of our revenue from the sale of services and parts and rentals of our systems 
we sell worldwide to service providers  businesses and other enterprises directly through our sales force and indirectly through distributors  value added resellers and system integrators 
shipments to certain distributors are made under terms allowing certain rights of return  protection against subsequent price declines on our products held by our distributors and co op marketing programs 
effective june   we began to recognize sales of our wwan products to distributors with rights of return upon shipment by the distributors to the end user customer 
formerly  we recognized revenue for sales of wwan products to distributors with rights of return upon shipment to the distributor and provided reserves for the estimated amount of product returns 
the combination of the changes resulting from the acquisition of the agere systems wlan business and the adoption of one uniform method is consistent with our plans to sell bundled and integrated wlan and wwan products 
this change in accounting methodology was treated as a change in estimate  and was made on a prospective basis starting in the third quarter of revenue from services  such as pre installation diagnostic testing and product repair services  is recognized over the period for which the services are performed  which is typically less than one month 
revenue from product rentals is recognized over the period of the rental 
revenue consists of product revenues  reduced by estimated sales returns and allowances 
provisions for estimated sales returns and allowances  which are based on historical trends  contractual terms and other available information  are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
our sales force focuses on key strategic accounts and also develops relationships with end users that purchase through distributors and value added resellers 
distributors sell our products to end users  and value added resellers not only sell our products to end users  but also assist end users in network design  installation and testing 
we market our products through strategic relationships we have with systems integrators  which design and install networks that incorporate our systems 
additionally  we sell directly to oem customers 
we sell both design in products for integration into their wireless computing platforms and branded products as private label models 
any significant decline in direct sales to end users or in sales to our distributors or value added resellers  or the loss of any of our distributors  value added resellers or oem customers  could materially adversely affect our revenue 
during  we sold our products to approximately customers in countries 
in  international sales accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
we expect international sales to vary but remain significant as a percentage of overall sales in the future 
currently  all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we are not directly exposed to currency exchange risks other than the risk that exchange rate fluctuations may make our products more expensive for customers outside the united states and  as a result  could decrease international sales 
in addition  we face risks inherent in conducting global business 
these risks  which are more fully described herein  include extended collection time for receivables  reduced ability to enforce obligations and reduced protection for our intellectual property 
as we have increased sales through our distributors and value added resellers  we have experienced a decline in the average selling prices of our products 
this is because the prices of the products that we sell indirectly through distributors and value added resellers are typically lower than the prices of the products we sell directly through our sales force to end users 
we have also lowered our prices for older products as we introduce additional products that provide faster data rates 
these newer products have higher prices than our older products 
our international sales also have lower average selling prices when compared to our united states and canadian selling prices 
this is primarily due to our higher reliance on distributors and value added resellers for international sales  and also because our lower speed products  with significantly lower prices  are being sold in larger quantities internationally than domestically 
if indirect sales and sales in our international markets increase  we would expect that our average selling prices to further decline 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of outsourced manufacturing costs  component costs  labor and overhead costs  costs of acquiring finished parts from original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers  customer service and warranty costs 
we currently outsource the majority of our manufacturing and supply chain management to a limited number of independent contract manufacturers  who obtain components for our products from suppliers 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to these contract manufacturers and component suppliers 
the remainder of our cost of revenue 
table of contents is related to our in house manufacturing operations  which consist primarily of quality control  final assembly  testing and product integration 
we expect to realize lower per unit product costs as we continue to outsource more of our in house manufacturing as well as have our products produced at lower cost off shore locations 
however  we cannot assure you when or if cost reductions will occur 
the failure to achieve these cost reductions could materially adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
gross profit 
our gross profit is affected by both the average selling prices of our systems and our cost of revenue 
historically  decreases in our average selling prices have generally been offset by reductions in our per unit product cost 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will achieve any reductions in per unit product cost in the future or that any reductions will offset a reduction in our average selling prices 
gross profit will be affected by a variety of factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  the degree to which our manufacturing is outsourced  the location of manufacturing  cost reduced product designs  future manufacturing licenses of our products  product mix  competitive pricing pressures  the degree of customization of individual products required by oem customers and component and assembly costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  prototype development expenses  consultant fees and allocated overhead related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products and underlying technologies 
we expense all research and development expenses as incurred 
we expect to decrease our research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue during the next two quarters in order to reduce our breakeven point 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  product marketing  sales support functions  advertising  trade show and other promotional expenses and allocated overhead 
we intend to decrease our selling  general and administrative expenditures as a percentage of revenue during the next two quarters in order to reduce our breakeven point 
stock option programs 
we have implemented stock option programs for employees and members of our board of directors to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified business and technical personnel 
prior to our initial public offering  we recorded deferred stock compensation on certain options for the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date the stock options were granted 
this amount is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting period 
the amortization expense relates to options awarded to employees in all operating expense categories 
as of december   all deferred stock compensation was amortized 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  equity investments  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring  long term service contracts  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition effective june   we began to recognize sales of our wwan products to distributors with rights of return upon shipment by the distributors to the end user customer 
formerly  we recognized revenue for sales of wwan products to distributors with rights of return upon shipment to the distributor and provide reserves for the estimated amount of product returns 
the combination of the changes resulting from the then proposed acquisition of the agere system s wlan business and the adoption of one uniform method was consistent with our plans to sell bundled and integrated wlan and wwan products 
this change in accounting methodology was treated as a change in estimate  and was made on a prospective basis starting in the third quarter of deferred gross profit on these distributors sales at december  was million 
in addition to the deferral of product revenue identified below  we 
table of contents reported accounts receivable net of deferred revenue and carried the value of the related products as consigned inventory 
as of december   accounts receivable was reduced by million to million and we recorded consigned inventory of million which increased total inventory to million 
allowance for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts we record estimated reductions to revenue for sales return  customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price protection and promotions 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty provision we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
valuation of inventories we write down our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs  including adverse purchase order commitments  may be required 
valuation of minority interest investments we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus  one of which is publicly traded and has highly volatile share prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess 
table of contents of our recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
restructuring costs and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise  exiting businesses 
any decision to limit investment in or to dispose of or otherwise  exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges  such as inventory and technology related write offs and workforce reduction costs  charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities  or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products 
estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions 
estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets  including purchased intangible assets  could change as a result of such assessments and decisions 
additionally  we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
patent litigation and infringement costs we have been involved in litigation in the normal course of business 
the results of any litigation matter are inherently uncertain 
in the event of any adverse decision in litigation with third parties that was pending as of december  and those that could arise in the future with respect to patents  other intellectual property rights relevant to our products and defective products  we could be required to pay damages and other expenses  to cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to expand significant resources to develop non infringing technology  or to obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our operating results

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenue  net 
we classify our products into two product lines wireless wide area network  or wwan  product line  and  wireless local area network  or wlan  product line 
the wwan product line includes point to point lynx and tsunami products and point to multipoint tsunami products 
the wlan product line includes a and orinoco products 
prior to the march  merger with proxim  inc  we did not have a wlan product line 
historical wlan revenue prior to march  of the former proxim  inc and prior to august  for the orinoco products acquired from agere are not reported in the table below 
revenue information by product line is as follows in thousands product line wwan wlan total revenue for the year ended december   three distributors  comstor  somera communications  inc and tessco technologies accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenue 
for the year ended december   comstor accounted for of total revenue 
revenue increased from million in to million in revenue increased primarily due to the contribution of sales of wlan products totaling million acquired in both the merger with proxim  inc on march  and the acquisition of the orinoco product line from agere on august  this increase was partially offset by a decrease in wwan product sales 
the decrease in wwan product sales was attributable  in part  to the adoption of a uniform sell through revenue recognition methodology for products that are sold through distribution channels with rights of return 
this accounting methodology change was implemented on a prospective basis effective june   and resulted in the deferral of million of revenue from wwan products shipped to distributors as of december   that were not sold through to end customers 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased from in to in the increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to increased revenue 
the increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to the contribution of sales from wlan products acquired in both the merger with proxim  inc and the acquisition of the wlan systems business from agere systems 
wlan products generally carry lower gross margins as a percentage of revenue than wwan products 
provision for excess and obsolete inventory  we recorded a provision for excess and obsolete inventory  including purchase commitments  totaling million during as part of our restructuring charge  of which million related to excess and obsolete inventory and million related to purchase commitments 
to mitigate the component supply constraints that have existed in the past  we built inventory levels for certain components with long lead times and entered into longer term commitments for certain components 
the excess inventory charges were due to the following factors a sudden and significant decrease in demand for certain lynx and tsunami license exempt point to point products  notification from customers that they would not be ordering as much as they had previously indicated  management s strategy to discontinue the lynx and tsunami point to point licensed products in order to concentrate on the license exempt products  and management s strategy to discontinue certain lynx and tsunami license exempt products in order to concentrate on selling next generation lynx and tsunami license exempt products 
due to these factors  inventory levels exceeded the our requirements based on current month sales forecasts 
the additional excess and obsolete inventory charge was calculated based on the inventory levels in excess of the estimated month demand for each specific product family 
we do not currently anticipate that the excess inventory subject to this reserve will be used at a later date based on our current month demand forecast 
we use a month demand forecast because the wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological changes such that if we have not sold a product after a month period it is unlikely that 
table of contents the product will be sold 
the following is a summary of the movements in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory during balance as of december  additional reserve for excess and obsolete inventory balance acquired with proxim  inc inventory scrapped balance as of december  research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to the cost of increased personnel  including employees added as a result of both the proxim  inc merger and the acquisition of the wlan systems business of agere  prototype spending for the development of new products and enhancements to existing products 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses increased from in to in primarily due to increased personnel expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to increases in sales and marketing personnel expenses  including employees added as a result of both the proxim  inc merger and the acquisition of the wlan systems business of agere  advertising  tradeshow  and public relations expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in the percentage decrease was primarily due to efforts to control costs  including the reductions of headcount and discretionary spending 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets increased from million in to million in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets increased primarily due to the increased intangible assets from both the merger with proxim  inc on march  and the acquisition of the wlan systems business of agere offset by the cessation of amortization of goodwill arose from acquisitions completed prior to june  subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
beginning on january  amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased from million in to million in amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased primarily due to the issuance of stock options at fair value since the completion of our initial public offering in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
in december  due to the recent significant decline in forecasted revenue and the cash flows therefrom  we made a complete assessment of the carrying value of all goodwill and other intangibles assets in accordance with sfas no 
first  we determined the fair value of its equity to be less than the carrying value of goodwill 
as such  an impairment charge was applicable in accordance with sfas no 
as of december  then we quantified the goodwill impairment as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeded the estimated fair value of the asset 
the carrying value of goodwill totaling million as of december  exceeded the estimated fair value of million and  accordingly  we took a charge for the impairment of goodwill of million 
impairment of loan to officer 
prior to  proxim  inc had guaranteed up to million of obligations of an officer of the company  with respect to a margin loan with an investment bank 
we assumed the guaranty in the merger with proxim  inc and on october   the investment bank called our guaranty of million 
we continue to seek repayment from the officer under a reimbursement and security agreement 
in this regard  in january  the officer made a cash payment of million to us with the proceeds of a second mortgage on his home 
we assessed the recoverability of the remaining balance of the loan with respect to the officer s current financial position and recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of this impairment charge does not constitute forgiveness of the officer s indebtedness to us 
future payments by the officer under the reimbursement and security agreement will be recorded as income in the period cash is received 
restructuring charges 
during  we recorded million of restructuring charges  including million  million  million and million in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively  related to closure of certain facilities  discontinued product lines and severance pay 
the charges included million of cash provisions  which included severance of million for employees  million related to excess facilities and for future lease commitments and exit costs related to the closure of four facilities  related to consulting fees 
the charge also included million of non cash provisions related to fixed assets that will no longer be used at the facilities 

table of contents during  we recorded million of restructuring charges related to the closure of our former ubiquity operations and employee severance

the million expensed to purchased in process research and development in related to next generation enterprise access points  radio backbone systems  broadband gateways and network management products acquired in the acquisition of agere s wlan systems business  technology for next generation asics acquired in the nband acquisition and a and homerf wireless networking products acquired related to the proxim  inc merger 
the million expensed to purchased in process research and development in related to the wirelesshome acquisition for point to multipoint technology 
merger costs 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred million of merger costs in connection with the aborted acquisition of adaptive broadband corporation 
adaptive broadband corporation reimbursed us million of those costs 
the additional million in was recorded in operating expenses 
the additional  in the first quarter of represented additional merger costs recorded in operating expenses 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net decreased from income of million in to expense of  in the increase in interest expense is mainly attributable to interest on the convertible promissory notes issued in august and decreased interest income due to lower applicable return rates on cash balances 
income tax provision benefit 
the income tax provision for was primarily the result of establishing a full valuation allowance in the first quarter of to offset deferred tax assets brought forward from december  in assessing our ability to realize deferred income tax assets  we considered whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as a result of the losses incurred  there is significant uncertainty  as to the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million against our deferred tax assets in the year ended december  our income tax provision was million for the year ended december  as compared to an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  our effective tax rates were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the effective rates in and were higher than federal statutory rate of plus the state tax rate of  net of federal benefits  primarily due to the increase in valuation allowance  expenses related to charges for goodwill impairment  amortization of goodwill and intangible assets  purchased in process research and development and equity investments that were not deductible for income tax purposes

we occupy our facilities under several non cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through november  and require payment of property taxes  insurance  maintenance and utilities 
future payments under contractual obligations as of december   were as follows in thousands payments due by period total amounts less than over committed year years years years operating leases purchase order commitments redemption of series a preferred stock for the year ended december   we recorded a restructuring charge related to the committed future lease payments for closed facilities  net of estimated future sublease receipts of million was included in the above disclosures 
as of december   we had unconditional purchase order commitments of million for excess and obsolete inventory  which were included as other current liabilities 
we are required to redeem all outstanding shares of series a preferred stock for cash in august if not previously converted into common stock 
in december  we entered into a secured credit facility  and subsequently amended the credit facility in march under the secured credit facility we can borrow up to million pursuant to a revolving loan which will mature on april  the amount that we may borrow under the secured credit facility is determined by a borrowing base equal to of eligible accounts receivable from account debtors who are not distributors plus of eligible accounts receivable from account debtors who are distributors 
if the outstanding principal amount of the loan exceeds our borrowing base from time to time  we will be required to immediately pay to the lender such excess 
we are required to comply with financial covenants that limit our maximum quarterly adjusted net loss and require that we maintain unrestricted cash balances on deposit at the lender in an amount not less than the outstanding principal balance under the credit facility plus million until december   increasing to million beginning january  if we fail to comply with these financial covenants  the lender will be entitled to assume collection of our accounts receivable and we will be required to meet a minimum tangible net worth requirement and certain other terms of the facility will change 
obligations under the secured credit facility are secured by a security interest on substantially all of the assets of proxim  except for intellectual property 
if we breach the financial covenants  obligations under the secured credit facility will also be secured by a security interest on our intellectual property 
the secured credit facility requires the consent of our lender in order to incur debt  grant liens  make acquisitions or merge  make certain restricted payments and sell assets 
the events of default under the secured credit facility include the failure to pay amounts due  including principal and interest  within three days after it becomes due  failure to observe or perform covenants subject to grace periods in certain cases  bankruptcy and insolvency events  defaults under certain of our other obligations and the occurrence of a material adverse change in our business 
proxim is seeking to renegotiate a material lease on a building in sunnyvale  california that is in excess of the requirements of the business for the foreseeable future 
this building was vacated in july  and the net expected lease costs were included the restructuring charge recorded in the second quarter of  totaling over million through the term of the lease in  net of expected sublease proceeds 
the rent rates of this lease are substantially greater than the current local market lease rates and this unused space represents a negative cash flow of approximately  per quarter 
the company has not been able to sublease the building since it was vacated in july to date  the building owner has not been responsive to our requests to renegotiate the lease 
since november  we have ceased making direct lease payments and the building owner has been utilizing our cash security deposits to cover the monthly payments 
the building owner could elect to stop using our security deposits for this purpose at any time  and the lease further obligates us to replenish the security deposits 
these deposits  supplemented by a letter of credit  however  could cover lease rent payments until december the building owner also has the option to terminate the remaining rent under the lease and sue us for the net present value of the lease less the present value of the amount for which we show the building owner could have leased the building to another party  plus the building owner s releasing costs 
the building owner has notified us of our defaults  but has not elected to terminate the lease at this time 
instead  the building owner has threatened legal action to force us to directly pay the monthly rent since november  as well as interest and penalties 
accordingly  we have an opportunity to cure our breach by restoring the security deposits as required by the lease  paying interest and penalties  and remaining current on future rent obligations under the lease 
in the event that the building owner were to terminate the lease and sue us for breach  we would be in breach of the covenants of our bank line of credit  and our borrowing rights could be limited or terminated 
in this event  we would not have enough cash available to meet the potential damages sought under the lease  and we could be required to seek protection from the bankruptcy courts 
at this time  we cannot determine whether the building owner is willing to renegotiate the current lease or will pursue remedies through the courts 
we have taken steps to reduce our expenses from operations by decreasing research and development and general and administrative expenses in order to begin generating cash flow from operations in the first quarter of these steps were taken in october  and we recorded approximately million of restructuring charges related primarily to severance payments in the fourth quarter of we also reduced the amount of consignment inventories held by distributors by reducing manufacturing volumes in the fourth quarter of and expect to reduce the amount of consignment inventories in the first quarter of below the expected sell through of products during that periods 
we believe that our current available cash and investments combined with our available borrowings will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
our management intends to invest any cash in excess of current operating requirements in interest bearing investment grade securities 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including management of working capital  the success of marketing  sales and distribution efforts  the timing of research and product development efforts and expansion of our marketing efforts 

table of contents there can be no assurance that additional capital beyond the amounts currently forecasted by us will not be required nor that any such required additional capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such time or times as required by us 
we may need to raise additional funds if our estimates change or prove inaccurate or in order for us to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or to strengthen our financial position 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to proxim  as well as factors beyond our control  including the continued weakness of the wireless communications industry  volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets  our ability to remain listed on the nasdaq national market  our ability to pay obligations as they become due  as well as increased market uncertainty following the terrorist attacks of september   the ongoing us war on terrorism and the war with iraq 
there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  and any need to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional  and perhaps significant dilution 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents our operating results for each of the eight quarters in the period ending december  the information for each of these quarters is unaudited and has been prepared on the same basis as our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period

table of contents our quarterly results may fluctuate for many reasons  including the following the effectiveness of our distribution channels and the success in maintaining our current distribution channels and developing new distribution channels  our ability to effectively manage the development of new business segments and markets  seasonal factors that may affect capital spending by customers  our ability to successfully manage the integration of operations  the sell through rate of our orinoco products acquired in our acquisition of agere s wlan systems business through consumer retail channels  market adoption of radio frequency  or rf  standards based products such as those compliant with the ieee b  ieee a  ieee g or bluetooth specifications  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and to manage product transitions  the sell through rate of our wlan and wwan products through commercial distribution channels  market demand for our point to point lynx and tsunami systems  market demand for our point to multipoint systems  the mix of products sold because our products generate different gross margins  a decrease in the average selling prices of our products  our ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure  difficulties in expanding and conducting international operations  and general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the wireless communications industry 
we have experienced disruptions in our operations from some of the factors listed above and may experience them again 
in addition  we are dependent on decisions by service providers  businesses and other enterprises to build wireless networks 
these decisions are in turn dependent upon the success and expected demand for the services offered by those service providers  businesses and other enterprises 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends  and a high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed in the short term 
as a result  any delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
due to the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock may fall 
seasonality historically  our revenues have been higher in the last two quarters of the fiscal year 
in addition our revenues have historically been significantly higher in the last month of each quarter 
this shift may primarily be attributed to the budgetary constraints of the customers in our industry and weather conditions that make an outdoor installation more difficult during the winter 
however  going forward  we believe the impact of seasonal fluctuations on our business will decrease because demand for our products is increasing at a rate that outpaces any budget restrictions our customers may have 
moreover  our expansion into international markets may minimize the impact that weather conditions may have on our overall sales 
risk factors this annual report on form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
we may not achieve certain benefits and synergies expected from our march  merger with proxim  inc or the august  acquisition of the wlan systems business of agere  either of which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results and or could result in the loss of key personnel 
we will need to overcome significant challenges in order to realize any benefits or synergies from our merger with proxim  inc and our acquisition of the wlan systems business of agere  including agere s orinoco product line 
such challenges include the timely  efficient and successful execution of a number of post transaction events  including integrating the operations of these businesses  particularly geographically dispersed operations  integrating the management information systems  accounting systems and reporting process  retaining and assimilating the key personnel of each company  retaining existing customers of each company and attracting additional customers  retaining strategic partners of each company and attracting new strategic partners  and creating uniform standards  controls  procedures  policies and information systems 
the execution of these post transaction events will involve considerable risks and may not be successful 
these risks include the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management  unanticipated expenses  including possible restructuring charges  and potential delays related to integration of technology and other resources of these companies  the impairment of relationships with employees  suppliers and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel  and potential unknown liabilities associated with the transactions and the combined operations 
in addition  termination of employees in connection with our restructuring efforts following these transactions may expose us to claims seeking damages for wrongful terminations 
in that regard  we are party to disputes  including legal actions  with a number of former employees 
these disputes relate primarily to claims for wrongful termination and severance benefits due to several reductions in force we have implemented in and following the merger with proxim  inc and the acquisition of agere s wlan systems business 
as a result of the merger between proxim and western multiplex  and the acquisition of agere systems wlan systems business during  we identified a requirement to consolidate and integrate our management information systems 
we are implementing a new enterprise resource planning and financial accounting and planning system during the second quarter of  and integrating this new system with our customer relationship management system and our product management system  as well as creating electronic interfaces to certain supply chain partners information systems and certain customers information systems 
implementation of the new management information system  including the integration with other systems is a very complex process that requires significant financial resources and personnel time  as well as unifying operating policies and procedures to ensure that the total system operates efficiently and effectively 
delays or errors in the implementation could result in additional costs and cause disruptions to our business  which could adversely affect our ability to accurately report our financial results on a timely basis and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the combined company may not succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with our merger with proxim  inc or our acquisition of agere s wlan systems business 
we are not profitable and may not be profitable in the future 
for the year ended december  we had a million net loss attributable to holders of our common stock 
we cannot assure you that our revenue will increase or continue at current levels or growth rates or that we will achieve profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and the limited histories of western multiplex  proxim  inc and the agere wireless systems business we acquired in producing many of their products  period to period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicating what our future performance will be 
we expect that we will continue to incur significant sales  marketing  product development and administrative expenses 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability and we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability 
table of contents in the future 
any failure to significantly increase our revenue or control costs as we implement our product and distribution strategies would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
the market price of our common stock may further decline as a result of our merger with proxim  inc or our acquisitions of agere s wlan systems business 
the market price of our common stock declined following our acquisitions in and may further decline as a result of these transactions for a number of reasons  including if the integration of the these businesses is not completed in a timely and efficient manner  the combined company does not achieve the perceived benefits of these transactions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts  industry analysts or investors  or the effect of these transactions on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial analysts  industry analysts or investors 
in this regard  our financial results for the third quarter of did not meet the expectations of financial analysts and the market price of our common stock declined 
our merger with proxim  inc and our acquisition of agere s wlan systems business may adversely affect our financial results 
we incurred transaction costs of approximately million in connection with our merger with proxim  inc and approximately million in connection with the agere asset purchase 
if the benefits of these transactions do not exceed the associated costs  including costs associated with integrating these businesses and dilution to our stockholders resulting from the issuance of shares in connection with the merger and the asset purchase and related financing  our financial results  including earnings per share  could be materially harmed 
products sales could decline if customer relationships are disrupted by our merger with proxim  inc and our acquisition of agere s wlan systems business 
the merger with proxim  inc or the agere asset purchase may have the effect of disrupting customer relationships 
former customers of western multiplex  proxim  inc and agere may not continue their current buying patterns following these transactions 
customers may defer purchasing decisions as they evaluate the likelihood of successful integration of the combined company or may instead purchase products of competitors 
any significant delay or reduction in orders for our products could cause our products sales to decline 
we have a limited operating history with some of our current product lines  which makes your evaluation of our business difficult and will affect many aspects of our business 
proxim  inc produced its a products for a limited amount of time and western multiplex had just begun production of its tsunami point to multipoint product prior to the merger 
agere also had a limited operating history with its wlan equipment 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in developing industries  particularly companies in relatively new and rapidly evolving markets 
these risks include an evolving and unpredictable business model  uncertain acceptance of new products and services  competition  and challenges in managing growth 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in addressing these risks 
if we fail to do so  our revenue and operating results could be materially harmed 

table of contents we may experience fluctuations in operating results and may not be able to adjust spending in time to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall which may cause operating results to fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which will be outside our control 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to planned expenditures could materially harm our operating results and financial condition  and may cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this happens  the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 
factors that may harm operating results include the effectiveness of our distribution channels and the success in maintaining our current distribution channels and developing new distribution channels  our ability to effectively manage the development of new business segments and markets  seasonal factors that may affect capital spending by customers  our ability to successfully manage the integration of operations  the sell through rate of our orinoco products acquired in our acquisition of agere s wlan systems business through consumer retail channels  market adoption of radio frequency  or rf  standards based products such as those compliant with the ieee b  ieee a  ieee g or bluetooth specifications  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and to manage product transitions  the sell through rate of our wlan and wwan products through commercial distribution channels  market demand for our point to point lynx and tsunami systems  market demand for our point to multipoint systems  the mix of products sold because our products generate different gross margins  a decrease in the average selling prices of our products  our ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure  difficulties in expanding and conducting international operations  and general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the wireless communications industry 
historically  proxim  inc and western multiplex did not operate with a significant order backlog and a substantial portion of their revenues in any quarter were derived from orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
accordingly  a significant component of our revenue expectations will be based almost entirely on internal estimates of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
planned operating expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and are based in large part on these estimates 
if orders and revenue do not meet expectations  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in this regard  we did not achieve our revenue targets in the third quarter of  and we incurred a net loss attributable to the holders of our common stock of million in that quarter 
we have adopted a uniform sell through method of revenue recognition that may result in greater variability in our revenue recognition and therefore increased fluctuations in our operating results 
effective at the beginning of the third quarter of  we adopted a uniform sell through revenue recognition methodology for products that are sold through distribution channels with rights of return under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
after the merger of proxim  inc and western multiplex  we maintained the historical revenue recognition methods used by the two companies prior to the merger for the respective product lines a sell through method for wireless local area networking  or wlan  products  and a sell in method for wireless wide area networking  or wwan  products 
we have adopted the sell through method on a uniform basis because  following the acquisition of agere s wlan systems business  which also uses the sell through method  the wlan business is expected to represent more than half of proxim s revenues  and adopting one uniform method is consistent with the company s plans to sell bundled and integrated wlan and wwan products 
the adoption of 
table of contents the sell through method of revenue recognition for wwan products could result in greater variability in our revenue recognition  and  therefore  increased fluctuations in our operating results  because sell through shipments to customers may not be as predictable as sell in shipments to distributors 
our operating results have been  and could further be  adversely affected as a result of purchase accounting treatment and the impact of amortization and impairment of intangible assets relating to the merger and the agere asset purchase 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we accounted for our merger with proxim  inc using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  we have recorded the market value of our common stock issued in connection with the merger  the fair value of the options to purchase proxim  inc common stock that became options to purchase proxim corporation common stock and the amount of direct transaction costs as the cost of combining with proxim  inc we have allocated the cost of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including various identifiable intangible assets such as acquired technology and acquired trademarks and trade names and in process research and development  based on their respective fair values at the date of the completion of the merger 
intangible assets are required to be amortized prospectively over their estimated useful lives 
the purchase price was allocated to deferred compensation  based on the portion of the intrinsic value of the unvested proxim  inc options we have assumed to the extent that service is required after completion of the merger in order to vest 
any excess of the purchase price over those fair market values will be accounted for as goodwill 
we are not required to amortize goodwill against income but goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets will be subject to periodic reviews for impairment 
in this regard  due to the decline in forecasted revenue in future periods  we took a charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of the impairment charged was measured as the amount that the carrying amount exceeded its estimated fair value 
if we are required to recognize additional impairment charges  the charge will negatively impact reported earnings in the period of the charge 
shares eligible for future sale  including shares owned by our principal stockholders  may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
the potential for sales of substantial amounts of our common stock into the public market may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
to finance our acquisition of agere s wlan systems business  we entered into a securities purchase agreement with warburg pincus and broadview capital  who agreed to collectively invest million in the company 
these investors received  shares of series a preferred stock in the amount of approximately million  with a conversion price of approximately per share  and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock valued at million 
the value of the warrants was recorded as a reduction of the series a preferred stock carrying value and recorded as additional paid in capital 
a deemed preferred stock dividend representing the beneficial conversion feature of the series a preferred stock of million was also recorded to increase the loss attributable to holders of our common stock 
the remaining million of the investment was in the form of convertible notes 
upon receipt of approval of our stockholders at a special meeting held on october   the notes issued to these investors were converted into  shares of series a preferred stock and we granted to these investors additional warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
in total  the investors were granted warrants to acquire  shares of common stock for approximately per share 
the series a preferred stock and warrants issued to the investors represent approximately of our outstanding common stock on an as converted and as exercised basis as of december  the initial liquidation preference of attributable to the series a preferred stock bears interest at an annual rate of through the third anniversary of the date of issuance  resulting in an increase in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock over time  to an aggregate of approximately million 
we agreed to file this registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to register this common stock 
upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part  the investors will have the right to resell the common stock 
in addition  approximately million of our outstanding shares of common stock are held by affiliates of ripplewood investments llc and an aggregate of approximately million of our outstanding shares of common stock are held by jonathan zakin  who is our chairman and chief executive officer  and his affiliates 
the shares of common stock held by these stockholders are restricted securities within the meaning of rule under the securities act and are eligible for resale subject to the volume  manner of sale  holding period and other limitations of rule or in a registered offering 
in the event that the affiliates of ripplewood investments llc distribute shares that they hold to their members and partners that are not affiliates of the company  those distributed shares could be immediately sold without regard to any volume limitations 
in connection with the execution of the merger agreement between proxim  inc  western multiplex and certain other parties  the affiliates of ripplewood investments llc 
table of contents that now hold shares of proxim corporation common stock entered into a stockholders agreement that set limitations on their ability to transfer their shares  including distributions to members and partners  for a limited period of time and provided registration rights with respect to their shares 
in exchange for a voting agreement in connection with the agere asset purchase  and effective as of august   we released the affiliates of ripplewood investments llc from the resale restrictions set forth in such stockholders agreement 
if affiliates of ripplewood investments llc distribute all or a significant number of our shares  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 
in addition to outstanding shares eligible for sale  as of december   options and warrants to acquire million shares of our common stock were outstanding 
also  as of december   approximately an additional million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance to our employees under existing and or assumed stock option plans 
competition within the wireless networking industry is intense and is expected to increase significantly 
our failure to compete successfully could materially harm our prospects and financial results 
the market for broadband wireless systems and wireless local area networking and building to building markets are extremely competitive and we expect that competition will intensify in the future 
increased competition could adversely affect our business and operating results through pricing pressures  the loss of market share and other factors 
the principal competitive factors affecting wireless local area networking and fixed wireless markets include the following data throughput  effective rf coverage area  interference immunity  network security  network scalability  price  integration with voice technology  wireless networking protocol sophistication  ability to support industry standards  roaming capability  power consumption  product miniaturization  product reliability  ease of use  product costs  product features and applications  product time to market  product certifications  changes to government regulations with respect to each country served and related to the use of radio spectrum  brand recognition  oem partnerships  marketing alliances  manufacturing capabilities and experience  effective distribution channels  and company reputation 
we could be at a disadvantage when compared to competitors  particularly alcatel  business networks ab  cisco systems  d link  intel corporation and linksys announced to be acquired by cisco systems on march   subject to regulatory approvals  that have broader distribution channels  brand recognition  extensive patent portfolios and more diversified product lines 
we have several competitors in our commercial wireless business  including without limitation  alvarion the merger of breezecom and floware  ceragon networks  cisco systems  dmc stratex networks  enterasys networks  harris corporation  intel corporation  intersil corporation  nokia corporation  symbol technologies and com corporation 
we also face competition from a variety of companies that offer different technologies in the emerging home networking market  including several companies developing competing wireless networking products 
additionally  numerous companies have announced their intention to develop competing products in both the commercial wireless and home networking markets  including several asia based companies offering low price ieee b products 
we could also face future competition from companies that offer products which replace network adapters or offer alternative communications solutions  or from large computer companies  pc peripheral companies  as well as other large networking equipment companies that integrate network adapters into their products 
furthermore  we could face competition from certain of our oem customers  which have  or could acquire  wireless engineering and product development capabilities  or might elect to offer competing technologies 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these competitors or those competitive pressures we face will not adversely affect our business or operating results 
many of our present and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and distribution of their products 
these competitors may succeed in establishing technology standards or strategic alliances in the wlan and building to building markets  obtain more rapid market acceptance for their products  or otherwise gain a competitive advantage 
we can offer no assurance that we will succeed in developing products or technologies that are more effective than those developed by our competitors 
furthermore  we compete with companies that have high volume manufacturing and extensive marketing and distribution capabilities  areas in which we have only limited experience 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing and new competitors as wireless markets evolve and the level of competition increases 
wireless networking markets are subject to rapid technological change and to compete  we must continually introduce new products that achieve broad market acceptance 
we have expended substantial resources in developing products that are designed to conform to the ieee standards and the homerf specification 
there can be no assurance  however  that the ieee compliant products and symphony homerf products will have a meaningful commercial impact 
in  the ieee approved a new ghz wlan standard  designated as 
table of contents b 
based on direct sequence spread spectrum technology  this new standard increased the nominal data rate from mbps to mbps 
in addition  we developed higher speed frequency hopping technology based on the fcc part rule change adopted in august  that allowed for wider band hopping channels and increased the data rate from mbps to up to mbps based on the homerf standard 
there can be no assurance that any such new products will compete effectively with ieee b standard compliant products 
in this regard  we have discontinued the development and production of homerf and homerf products due to the widespread market adoption of products based on the ieee b standard 
in august  we completed the acquisition of agere s wlan systems business  including its orinoco product line  and we are now selling a full line of b products 
in  a group of computer and telecommunications industry leaders  led by ericsson  began developing a short range rf method to connect mobile devices without cables called bluetooth 
based on low power ghz frequency hopping spread spectrum technology  numerous organizations are planning to deploy bluetooth technology in a wide variety of mobile devices such as cellular telephones  notebook computers and handheld computers 
we have not developed products that comply with bluetooth 
while bluetooth technology is available to develop or acquire in the market  there can be no assurance that we will develop or acquire such technology  or that if we do develop or acquire such technology  that such products will be competitive in the market 
in  the ieee approved a new ghz wlan standard designated as a 
this new standard is based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  or ofdm  technology with multiple data rates ranging from below mbps to approximately mbps 
in  the european telecommunications standards institute project bran broadband radio access networks committee approved a new ghz wlan standard designated as hiperlan  also based on ofdm technology 
we are currently shipping commercial units of a products  and certain competitors are also shipping a products 
the ieee is evaluating a number of improvements and enhancements to the a at ghz and b at ghz standards 
the g proposal is a high speed extension of b  offering up to mbps of throughput  that is expected to be approved during and commercial products are expected to be available by early certain competitors are shipping pre standard versions of g products 
in addition  we have begun commercial shipment of dual band adapters that comply with both the b and the a standards 
the e proposal is a quality of service enhancement to the a and b protocol for streaming multimedia support 
the i proposal addresses enhanced security for both a and b 
the h proposal addresses dynamic frequency selection and transmit power control for worldwide radio regulation 
given the emerging nature of the wlan market  there can be no assurance that the products and technology  or our other products or technology  will not be rendered obsolete by alternative or competing technologies 
in addition  when we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products  customers may defer purchasing our existing products 
these actions could materially adversely affect our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales  increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
as the market for our wireless networking products is evolving  we believe our ability to compete successfully in this market is dependent upon the continued compatibility and interoperability of our products with products and architectures offered by other vendors 
to remain competitive  we need to introduce products in a timely manner that incorporate or are compatible with these new technologies as they emerge 
if we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products  we may license technology from other businesses or acquire other businesses as an alternative to internal research and development 
to remain competitive  we will need to expand and adapt our organization 
failure to effectively manage growth could result in an inability to support and maintain our operations 
we anticipate that we will need to expand and adapt our organization in order to address new market opportunities for our products 
this could place a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
we cannot assure you that our personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations  our management will be able to identify  hire  train  motivate or manage required personnel  or our management will be able to successfully identify and exploit existing and potential market opportunities 
we announced a reorganization of our corporate structure on december   consolidating our operating divisions from four to two 
we cannot assure you that this reorganization will be successful or will not impair our ability to manage our business 
in 
table of contents addition  we could experience lower earnings as a result of expenses associated with growing our operations  whether through internal development or through acquisitions 
we will depend on international sales and our ability to sustain or expand international sales is subject to many risks  which could adversely affect our operating results 
during the year ended ending december   international sales accounted for approximately of our total sales 
revenue from shipments by western multiplex to customers outside of the united states  principally to a limited number of distributors  represented and of total revenue during the calendar years and  respectively 
revenue from shipments by proxim  inc to customers outside the united states  principally to a limited number of distributors and oem customers  represented and of total revenue during the calendar years and  respectively 
agere s sales of its orinoco products included sales to a number of international customers  and we expect that we will continue to sell these products to a significant percentage of international customers 
we expect that our revenue from shipments to international customers will vary as a percentage of total revenue 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets  including the following uncertainty of product acceptance by customers in foreign countries  difficulty in assessing the ability to collect on orders to be shipped in an uncertain economic environment  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  export license and documentation requirements  unforeseen changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations  governmental restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the united states  foreign currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles for international distributors  tariffs  duties taxes and other trade barriers  difficulties in finding foreign licensees or joint venture partners  and potential political and economic instability 
there is a risk that such factors will harm our ability to continue to successfully operate internationally and our efforts to expand international operations 
in this regard  our revenue levels have been affected  in part  by reduced ability to ship our products to international customers in cases where collectibility  based on a number of factors  could not be reasonably assured 
while we may extend limited credit terms  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
there can be no assurance that foreign markets will continue to develop or that we will receive additional orders to supply our products to foreign customers 
our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected if foreign markets do not continue to develop or if we do not receive additional orders to supply our products for use by foreign customers 
to successfully expand international sales  we will need to recruit additional international sales and support personnel and expand our relationships with international distributors and value added resellers 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we may incur these additional costs and add these management burdens without successfully expanding sales 
this failure would harm our operating results 

table of contents the outbreak of war in iraq with the us and other countries may adversely affect domestic and international demand for our products and result in a further deterioration of global economic conditions  and may increase shipment times and costs for our products 
the outbreak of war in iraq with the us and other countries may adversely affect domestic and international demand for our products and result in a further deterioration of global economic conditions 
the continued worsening of the us economy has caused and may continue to cause us businesses to slow spending on products and delay sales cycles 
a continued worsening in the global economy may also cause foreign businesses to slow or halt spending on our products 
the economic uncertainty resulting from the unpredictable nature of ongoing military action and other involvements associated with a war in iraq may continue to negatively impact consumer and business confidence in the near term 
in addition  we manufacture a substantial portion of our products outside the united states  and we may experience delays in the delivery of our products or increased shipping costs as a result of increased security measures 
this economic uncertainty may make it more difficult to continue implementing our business strategy and may adversely impact our future revenues 
our revenue may decline and our ability to achieve profitability may be threatened if the demand for wireless services in general and broadband wireless access systems in particular does not continue to grow 
our success is dependent on the continued trend toward wireless telecommunications and data communications services 
if the rate of growth slows and service providers reduce their capital investments in wireless infrastructure or fail to expand into new geographic markets  our revenue may decline 
unlike some competitors such as alcatel  cisco systems  intel corporation  linksys and nortel networks corporation  among others  our principal product offerings rely on wireless technologies 
accordingly  we would experience a greater impact from a decline in the demand for wireless services than some of our most important competitors 
in addition  wireless access solutions are unproven in the marketplace and some of the wireless technologies  such as our tsunami point to multipoint technology and a and homerf technologies in which we are currently investing substantial capital  have only been commercially introduced in the last few years 
if wireless access technology turns out to be unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment  it is unlikely we could generate enough sales to achieve and sustain profitability 
we have listed below  in order of importance  the factors that we believe are key to the success or failure of broadband wireless access technology its reliability and security and the perception by end users of its reliability and security  its capacity to handle growing demands for faster transmission of increasing amounts of data  voice and video  the availability of sufficient frequencies for network service providers to deploy products at commercially reasonable rates  its cost effectiveness and performance compared to other forms of broadband access  whose prices and performance continue to improve  its suitability for a sufficient number of geographic regions  and the availability of sufficient site locations for network service providers to install products at commercially reasonable rates 
we have experienced the effects of many of the factors listed above in interactions with customers selecting wireless versus wire line technology 
for example  because of the frequency with which individuals using cellular phones experience fading or a loss of signal  customers often hold the perception that all broadband wireless technologies will have the same reliability constraints even though the wireless technology we use does not have the same problems as cellular phones 
in some geographic areas  because of adverse weather conditions that affect wireless transmissions  but not wire line technologies  we are not able to sell products as successfully as competitors with wire line technology 
in addition  future legislation  legal decisions and regulation relating to the wireless telecommunications industry may slow or delay the deployment of wireless networks 
we may also lose customers to different types of wireless technologies 
many of our products operate in the unlicensed frequency bands  in compliance with various governmental regulations 
in addition  many of the emerging wireless standards utilize these unlicensed frequency bands 
the proliferation and market acceptance of unlicensed wireless products increases the probability of interference among unlicensed devices 
increasing interference can adversely affect the operation of our unlicensed products  resulting in customers selecting alternative products that do not operate in these unlicensed frequency bands 
for example  we have only a limited offering of products that operate in licensed radio spectrums 
some customers  however  may want to operate in licensed radio spectrums because they sometimes offer less interference than license free radio spectrums or have other advantages 

table of contents our business will depend on rapidly evolving telecommunications and internet industries 
our future success is dependent upon the continued growth of the data communications and wireless industries  particularly with regard to internet usage 
the global data communications and internet industries are evolving rapidly and it is difficult to predict potential growth rates or future trends in technology development 
we cannot assure you that the deregulation  privatization and economic globalization of the worldwide telecommunications market that has resulted in increased competition and escalating demand for new technologies and services will continue in a manner favorable to us or our business strategies 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the growth in demand for wireless and internet services  and the resulting need for high speed or enhanced data communications products and wireless systems  will continue at its current rate or at all 
the combined company may be dependent on and receive a significant percentage of its revenue from a limited number of oem customers 
a limited number of oem customers may contribute a significant percentage of our revenue 
sales to one proxim  inc customer in calendar year represented approximately of total revenue 
agere s sales of its orinoco products included sales to oem customers 
we expect that sales to a limited number of oem customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
proxim  inc also experienced quarter to quarter variability in sales to each of its major oem customers 
sales of many of proxim  inc s wireless networking products depended upon the decision of a prospective oem customer to develop and market wireless solutions that incorporated proxim  inc s wireless technology 
oem customers orders are affected by a variety of factors  including the following new product introductions  end user demand for oem customers products  oem customers product life cycles  inventory levels  market and oem customers adoption of new wireless standards  manufacturing strategies  lengthy design in cycles  pricing  regulatory changes  contract awards  and competitive situations 
proxim  inc s agreements with oem customers typically did not require minimum purchase quantities 
the loss of one or more of  or a significant reduction in orders from  our major oem customers could materially and adversely affect our operating results or stock price 
in this regard  in the first quarter of  intel corporation  a homerf oem customer  announced that it would offer competing ieee b products for its next generation of consumer wireless networking devices 
this announcement resulted in a decrease in the market price of proxim  inc s common stock 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will become a qualified supplier for new oem customers or that we will remain a qualified supplier for existing oem customers 
our wwan business derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of distributors 
therefore  a decrease or loss in business from any of them may cause a significant delay or decline in our revenue and could harm our reputation 
our wwan business has historically generated a significant amount of revenue from a limited number of distributors 
the loss of business from any of these distributors or the delay of significant orders from any of them  even if only temporary  could significantly reduce our 
table of contents revenue  delay recognition of revenue  harm our reputation or reduce our ability to accurately predict cash flow 
one distributor accounted for approximately of our total revenue in the year ended december  for the year ended december   approximately of wwan revenue was derived from three distributors  and approximately of our revenue was derived from one of the three distributors 
we do not have long term contracts with any of these distributors 
while we expect to have a more diversified and expansive end customer base  the future success of our business will depend significantly on the timing and size of future purchase orders  if any  from a limited number of distributors 
in addition  as we continued the development of our distribution channels  we may consolidate demand through fewer  larger distributors in order the effectively manage a growing base of vars  resellers and sub distributors 
we depend on limited suppliers for key components that are difficult to manufacture  and because we may not have long term arrangements with these suppliers  we could experience disruptions in supply that could decrease or delay the recognition of revenues 
we depend on single or limited source suppliers for several key components used in our products 
proxim  inc and agere depended on single sources for our proprietary application specific integrated circuits  or asics  and assembled circuit boards 
any disruptions in the supply of these components or assemblies could delay or decrease our revenues 
in addition  even for components with multiple sources  there have been  and may continue to be  shortages due to capacity constraints caused by high demand 
in connection with our acquisition of agere s wlan systems business  we have entered into a three year strategic supply agreement with agere  pursuant to which agere will provide us with chips  modules and cards 
other than this agreement  we do not have any long term arrangements with our suppliers 
if  for any reason  a supplier fails to meet our quantity or quality requirements  or stops selling components to us or our contract manufacturers at commercially reasonable prices  we could experience significant production delays and cost increases  as well as higher warranty expenses and product reputation problems 
because the key components and assemblies of our products are complex  difficult to manufacture and require long lead times  we may have difficulty finding alternative suppliers to produce our components and assemblies on a timely basis 
we have experienced shortages of some of these components in the past  which delayed related revenue  and we may experience shortages in the future 
in addition  because the majority of our products have a short sales cycle of between and days  we may have difficulty in making accurate and reliable forecasts of product needs 
as a result  we could experience shortages in supply  which could delay or decrease revenue because our customers may cancel their orders or choose a competitor for their future needs 
we have limited manufacturing capabilities and we will need to increasingly depend on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing requirements 
we have limited manufacturing capability and limited experience in large scale or foreign manufacturing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop or contract for additional manufacturing capacity on acceptable terms on a timely basis 
in addition  in order to compete successfully  we will need to achieve significant product cost reductions 
although we intend to achieve cost reductions through engineering improvements  production economies  and manufacturing at lower cost locations including outside the united states  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
in order to remain competitive  we must continue to introduce new products and processes into our manufacturing environment  and there can be no assurance that any such new products will not create obsolete inventories related to older products 
for example  as a part of our restructuring charge in the first quarter of  we increased our provision for obsolete and excess inventory  including purchase commitments  totaling million  of which million related to excess inventory and million related to purchase commitments 
we subsequently reclassified this provision to cost of revenue for the first quarter of the provision related to a decrease in demand for certain products as well as our strategy to discontinue certain products in order to concentrate on selling next generation products 
proxim  inc relied on contract and subcontract manufacturers for turnkey manufacturing and circuit board assemblies which subjects us to additional risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of finished assemblies and assembled circuit boards and reduced control over the price  timely delivery and quality of such finished assemblies and assembled circuit boards 
if our sunnyvale facility were to become incapable of operating  even temporarily  or were unable to operate at or near our current or full capacity for an extended period  our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
proxim  inc outsourced manufacturing for its homerf products with flextronics international  inc  a turnkey contract manufacturer 
western multiplex depended on three domestic contract manufacturers to produce the majority of its products  and it depended on one of these manufacturers for the entire production of its tsunami point to multipoint product 
changes in our manufacturing operations to incorporate new products and processes  or to manufacture at lower cost locations outside the united states  could cause disruptions  which  in turn  could adversely affect customer relationships  cause a loss of market opportunities and negatively affect our business and operating results 
in addition  our reliance on a limited number of manufacturers involves a number of risks  including the risk that these manufacturers may terminate their relationship with us  may choose not to devote adequate capacity to produce our products or may delay production of our products 
if any of these risks are realized  we could experience an 
table of contents interruption in supply  which could have an adverse impact on the timing and amount our revenues 
during the fourth quarter of  we began to transition manufacturing of our tsunami point to multipoint products from a domestic contract manufacturing to off shore contract manufacturing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively transition these products  which  in turn  could adversely affect customer relationships  cause a loss of market opportunities and negatively affect our business and operating results 
our reliance on contract manufacturers could subject us to additional costs or delays in product shipments as demand for our products increases or decreases 
some contract manufacturers have decreased their operations in response to an overall contraction in demand for wireless networking products 
there can be no assurance that we will effectively manage our contract manufacturers or that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies or the loss of a contract manufacturer would result in costs to acquire additional manufacturing capacity and delays in shipments of our products  materially adversely affecting our business and operating results 
in addition  cancellations in orders as a result of decreases in demand for products may subject us to claims for damages 
in this regard  we are party to disputes  including legal actions  with a number of suppliers and vendors 
these disputes relate primarily to excess materials and order cancellation claims that resulted from declines in demand for our products during and and the commensurate reductions in manufacturing volumes 
we may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us 
our cash and investment balance declined million in the fourth quarter of we currently believe that our existing liquidity sources  including our bank line of credit  will satisfy our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in december we finalized a new credit facility with silicon valley bank 
the facility provides for borrowing of up to million  however the facility also requires us to maintain at least the outstanding principal plus million on deposit with silicon valley bank 
our ability to borrow under the credit facility is subject to a number of restrictions  as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity herein 
we cannot assure you that we will have access to the credit facility 
we are seeking to renegotiate the terms of a material lease  as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity 
if the building owner were to terminate the lease and sue us for breach  we would be in breach of the covenants in the credit facility  and our borrowing rights could be limited or terminated 
we may need to raise additional funds if our estimates change or prove inaccurate or in order for us to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or to strengthen our financial position 
because our stock is currently trading near historically low levels  any financing at these levels could be significantly dilutive to existing stockholders 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to us  as well as factors beyond our control  including increased market uncertainty following the events of september   the ongoing us war on terrorism and in iraq as well as conditions in capital markets 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us if at all 
we may be unable to achieve the manufacturing cost reductions and improvements required in order to achieve or maintain profitability 
the average selling prices of the products of western multiplex  proxim  inc and agere s wlan systems business declined in recent years 
if we do not reduce production costs and other expenses  we may not be able to offset this continuing decline and achieve or maintain profitability 
we must also develop and introduce on a timely basis new products that can be sold at higher average selling prices or produced at lower costs 
failure to decrease the cost of our products or to effectively develop new systems would cause our revenue to decline or to increase more slowly 
we expect that average selling prices of our products will continue to decrease because one of our strategies is to increase the percentage of domestic and international sales being made through distributors and value added resellers  and to oem customers  which involve lower prices than our direct sales 
this risk from declining average selling prices may also intensify because we expect that market conditions  particularly falling prices for competing broadband solutions  will force us to reduce prices over time 
under some circumstances  we may be forced to reduce prices even if it causes us to decrease gross profit or to take a loss on our products 
we may also be unable to reduce sufficiently the cost of our products to enable us to compete with other broadband access technologies with lower product costs 
in order to remain competitive  we will need to design our products so that they can be manufactured with low cost  automated manufacturing  assembly and testing techniques 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in designing our products to allow contract manufacturers to use lower cost  automated techniques 
in addition  any redesign may fail to result in sufficient cost reductions to allow us to significantly reduce the price of our products or prevent our gross profit from declining as prices decline 
because many of our current and planned products are or will be highly complex  they may contain defects or errors that are detectable only after deployment in complex networks and which  if detected  could harm our reputation  result in costs to us in excess of our estimates  adversely affect our operating results  result in a decrease in revenue or result in difficulty collecting accounts receivable 
many of our complex products can only be fully tested when deployed in commercial networks 
as a result  end users may discover defects or errors or experience breakdowns in their networks after the products have been deployed 
the occurrence of any defects or errors in these products  including defects or errors in components supplied by our contract manufacturers  could result in failure to achieve market acceptance and loss of market share  cancellation of orders  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  increased service and warranty costs  
table of contents diversion of resources  legal actions by customers and end users  and increased insurance costs and other losses to our business or to end users 
if we experience warranty failure that indicate either manufacturing or design deficiencies  we may be required to recall units in the field and or stop producing and shipping such products until the deficiency is identified and corrected 
in the event of such warranty failures  our business could be adversely affected resulting in reduced revenue  increased costs and decreased customer satisfaction 
because customers often delay deployment of a full system until the products have been tested by them and any defects have been corrected  we expect these revisions to cause delays in orders by our customers for our systems 
because our strategy is to introduce more complex products in the future  this risk will intensify over time 
end users have discovered errors in our products in the past and may discover errors in our products in the future 
recently  we have identified performance issues related to a power supply component provided by one of our contract manufacturers 
if the costs of remediating problems experienced by our customers exceeds our warranty reserves  these costs may adversely affect our operating results 
to compete effectively  we will need to establish and expand new distribution channels for our point to point and point to multipoint products and wlan products 
western multiplex sold its point to point and point to multipoint products and agere sold its orinoco products through domestic and international distributors 
we intend to add new distributors and value added resellers for the tsunami point to multipoint products 
in general  distributors  value added resellers and retailers offer products of several different companies  including products that may compete with our products 
accordingly  they may give higher priority to products of other suppliers  thus reducing our efforts to sell our products 
in addition they often focus on specific markets and we will need to add new distributors and value added resellers as we expand our sales to new markets 
agreements with distributors and retailers are generally terminable at their option 
any reduction in sales efforts or termination of a relationship may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
use of distributors and retailers also entails the risk that they will build up inventories in anticipation of substantial growth in sales 
if such growth does not occur as anticipated  they may substantially decrease the amount of products ordered in subsequent quarters 
such fluctuations could contribute to significant variations in our future operating results 
broadband wireless access solutions have some disadvantages and limitations as compared to other alternative broadband access solutions that may prevent widespread adoption  which could hurt our prospects 
broadband wireless access solutions  including point to point and point to multipoint systems  compete with other high speed access solutions such as digital subscriber lines  cable modem technology  fiber optic cable and other high speed wire line and satellite technologies 
if the market for our point to point and point to multipoint solutions fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect due to this competition  our sales opportunities will be harmed 
many of these alternative technologies can take advantage of existing installed infrastructure and are generally perceived to be reliable and secure 
as a result  they have already achieved significantly greater market acceptance and penetration than point to point and point to multipoint broadband wireless access technologies 
moreover  current point to point and point to multipoint broadband wireless access technologies have inherent technical limitations that may inhibit their widespread adoption in many areas  including the need for line of sight installation and  in the case of operating frequencies above ghz  reduced communication distance in bad weather 
we expect point to point and point to multipoint broadband wireless access technologies to face increasing competitive pressures from both current and future alternative technologies 
in light of these factors  many service providers may be reluctant to invest heavily in broadband wireless access solutions 
broadband wireless access products require a direct line of sight  which may limit the ability of service providers to deploy them in a cost effective manner and could harm our sales 
because of line of sight limitations  service providers often install broadband wireless access equipment on the rooftops of buildings and on other tall structures 
before undertaking these installations  service providers must generally secure roof rights from the owners of each building or other structure on which the equipment is to be installed 
the inability to easily and cost effectively obtain roof rights may deter customers from choosing to install broadband wireless access equipment  which could have an adverse effect on our sales 

table of contents inability to attract and retain key personnel could hinder our ability to operate 
our success depends to a large extent on the continued services of mr 
jonathan n 
zakin  chairman and chief executive officer  mr 
keith e 
glover  our executive vice president  chief financial officer and secretary  and other members of our senior management team 
the loss of the services of any of these management members could harm our business because of the crucial role each of them is expected to play in our operations and strategic development 
in order to be successful  we must also retain and motivate key employees  including those in managerial  technical  marketing and sales positions 
in particular  our product generation efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified engineers 
experienced management and technical  sales  marketing and support personnel in the wireless networking industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense 
this is particularly the case in silicon valley  where our headquarters are located 
in addition  our employees may experience uncertainty about their participation in the future of the combined company due to the following issues relating to recent business combination transactions changing employee roles with respect to proxim s announced operations strategies  the management of an increasing number of geographically dispersed operations and the related challenges of integrating a growing number of diverse local regulations  customs and practices 
these conditions may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management  technical  sales and marketing personnel 
we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on the strategies and goals of the combined company  which may be particularly difficult due to the potential distractions of the merger and morale challenges posed by any workforce reduction that may be implemented 
we may have difficulties with our acquisitions and investments  which could adversely affect our growth and financial condition 
from time to time  we may consider new business opportunities and ventures  including acquisitions  in a broad range of areas 
any decision to pursue a significant business expansion or new business opportunity would be accompanied by risks  including  among others requiring to invest a substantial amount of capital  which could materially harm our financial condition and ability to implement our existing business strategy  requiring to issue additional equity interests  which would be dilutive to our stockholders  placing additional and substantial burdens on our management personnel and financial and operational systems  the difficulty of assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the possible inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel  potential additional expenses associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets or the impairment of goodwill  additional expenses associated with the activities and expansion of the acquired businesses  and

on august   in connection with our acquisition of the wlan systems business from agere  we announced that we had entered into a cross license agreement with agere whereby  in part  agere agreed to settle the pending patent related litigation between the two companies 
on march   the company announced a settlement with intersil corporation to resolve all pending patent related litigation between the two companies 
under the terms of the agreement  the company and intersil have agreed to dismiss all claims against each other  including lawsuits before the international trade commission and delaware and massachusetts federal courts 
we are a party to disputes  including legal actions  with a number of suppliers and vendors 
these disputes relate primarily to excess materials and order cancellation claims that resulted from the declines in demand for our products during and and the commensurate reductions in manufacturing volumes 
we have recorded reserves related to these disputes to the extent that management believes that the company is liable 
we intend to vigorously defend ourself in these matters 
the results of any litigation matters are inherently uncertain 
in the event of any adverse decision in the described legal actions or disputes  or any other related litigation with third parties that could arise in the future with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights relevant to our products  we could be required to pay damages and other expenses  to cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  or to obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
these matters are in the early stages of litigation and  accordingly  we cannot make any assurance that these matters will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
compliance with governmental regulations in multiple jurisdictions where we sell our products is difficult and costly 
in the united states  we are subject to various federal communications commission  or fcc  rules and regulations 
current fcc regulations permit license free operation in certain fcc certified bands in the radio spectrum 
our spread spectrum wireless products are certified for unlicensed operation in the mhz  ghz  ghz and ghz frequency bands 
operation in these frequency bands is governed by rules set forth in part of the fcc regulations 
the part rules are designed to minimize the probability of interference to other users of the spectrum and  thus  accord part systems secondary status in the frequency 
in the event that there is interference between a primary user and a part user  a higher priority user can require the part user to curtail transmissions that create interference 
in this regard  if users of our products experience excessive interference from primary users  market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected  which could materially and 
table of contents adversely affect our business and operating results 
the fcc  however  has established certain standards that create an irrefutable presumption of noninterference for part users and we believe that our products comply with such requirements 
there can be no assurance that the occurrence of regulatory changes  including changes in the allocation of available frequency spectrum  changes in the use of allocated frequency spectrum  or modification to the standards establishing an irrefutable presumption for unlicensed part users  would not significantly affect our operations by rendering current products obsolete  restricting the applications and markets served by our products or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
the fcc is coordinating discussions between the united states military and the commercial wireless industry regarding the operation and potential interference from unlicensed ghz systems 
these discussions are intended to resolve the potential interference issues without a rule change to the operation of unlicensed ghz systems 
if a solution cannot be agreed upon by the parties  the fcc could change the regulations related to the operation of unlicensed ghz products 
such a change could have a material adverse affect upon the sale of our unlicensed ghz products 
our products are also subject to regulatory requirements in international markets and  therefore  we must monitor the development of spread spectrum and other radio frequency regulations in certain countries that represent potential markets for our products 
while there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with regulations in any particular country  we will design our products to minimize the design modifications required to meet various ghz and ghz international spread spectrum regulations 
in addition  we will seek to obtain international certifications for our product line in countries where there are substantial markets for wireless networking systems 
changes in  or the failure by us to comply with  applicable domestic and international regulations could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
in addition  with respect to those countries that do not follow fcc regulations  we may need to modify our products to meet local rules and regulations 
regulatory changes by the fcc or by regulatory agencies outside the united states  including changes in the allocation of available frequency spectrum  could significantly affect our operations by restricting our development efforts  rendering current products obsolete or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
several changes by the fcc were approved within the last eight years including changes in the allocation and use of available frequency spectrum  as well as the granting of an interim waiver 
these approved changes could create opportunities for other wireless networking products and services 
there can be no assurance that new regulations will not be promulgated  that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
it is possible that the united states and other jurisdictions will adopt new laws and regulations affecting the pricing  characteristics and quality of broadband wireless systems and products 
increased government regulations could decrease the growth of the broadband wireless industry  hinder our ability to conduct business internationally  reduce our revenues  increase the costs and pricing of our products  increase our operating expenses  and expose us to significant liabilities 
any of these events or circumstances could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
if the trading price of our common stock does not increase  we may not be able to meet the continued listing criteria for the nasdaq national market  which would adversely affect the ability of investors to trade our common stock and could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
on march   we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market  inc notifying us that for the prior consecutive trading days  the bid price of our common stock had closed below the per share minimum required for continued inclusion on nasdaq pursuant to nasdaq s marketplace rules 
in accordance with the marketplace rules  the company will be provided calendar days  or until september   to regain compliance with this requirement 
compliance will be achieved if the bid price per share of our common stock closes at per share or greater for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days prior to september  if compliance with the marketplace rules as currently in effect is not achieved by september   nasdaq will notify us that our stock will be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
in the event of such notification  we would have an opportunity to appeal nasdaq s determination or to apply to transfer our common stock to the nasdaq smallcap market 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market  or that we will be able to meet the listing criteria for the nasdaq smallcap market 
if as a result of the application of these listing requirements  our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  our common stock would become more difficult to buy and sell 
in addition  our common stock could be subject to certain rules placing additional requirements on brokers dealers who sell or make a market in our securities 
consequently  if we were removed from the nasdaq national market  the ability or willingness of broker dealers to sell or make a market in our common stock might decline  which would adversely affect the ability of investors to resell our common stock 
in addition  our ability to secure additional capital in financing transactions with investors might be impacted  which would adversely affect our business and financial condition 
the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuation  and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
the trading prices of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations  and such trend is likely to continue with respect to the trading price of our common stock 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  including quarterly variations in revenues and operating results  announcements of innovations and new products  strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors  changes in our expected operating expense levels  changes in financial estimates and recommendations of financial and industry analysts  the operating and securities price performance of comparable companies  and 
table of contents news reports relating to trends in the wireless communications industry 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for wireless related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may influence the trading price of our common stock 
these trading price fluctuations may make it more difficult to use our common stock as currency to make acquisitions that might otherwise be advantageous  or to use stock options as a means to attract and retain employees 
in addition  you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay  prevent or make more difficult a merger  tender offer  proxy contest or change of control of our company despite the possibility that such transactions may be viewed to be in the best interest of our stockholders since such transactions could result in a higher stock price than the then market price of our common stock 
among other things  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock with the terms of each series to be fixed by the board of directors  divide our board of directors into three classes so that only approximately one third of the total number of directors is elected each year  permit directors to be removed only for cause  and specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations 
in addition  with some exceptions  the delaware general corporation law will restrict or delay mergers and other business combinations between the company and any stockholder that acquires or more of our voting stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of corporate bonds purchased with an average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
exchange rate risk we currently have operations in the united states and several countries in south america  europe and asia 
the functional currency of all our operations is the us dollar 
though some expenses are incurred in local currencies by our overseas operations  substantially all of our transactions are made in us dollars  hence  we have minimal exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations relating to our transactions 
while we expect our international revenues to continue to be denominated predominately in us dollars  an increasing portion of our international revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the us dollar 
we will analyze our exposure to currency fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential fluctuations  however  exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future 

table of contents investment risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the fair value of our investments 
we invest in equity investments in a public company for business and strategic purposes and we have classified these securities as available for sale 
we also invest in equity instruments in a private company 
these equity investments  primarily in technology companies  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market and the industries in which these companies participate 
as of december   we had unrealized gain of  which was recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our objective in managing our exposure to stock market fluctuations is to minimize the impact of stock market declines to our earnings and cash flows 
there are  however  a number of factors beyond our control 
continued market volatility  as well as mergers and acquisitions  have the potential to have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods
