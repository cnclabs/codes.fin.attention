sales of these other digital media services are generally under nonrefundable time and materials or per unit contracts 
under these contracts  we recognize revenues as services are rendered and we have no continuing involvement in the goods and services delivered  which generally is the date the finished media is shipped to the customer 
we sell our music samples service in application service provider arrangements 
we are required to host the applications and the customer does not have the ability to have the application hosted by another entity without penalty to the customer 
billings are generally made based upon volumes of data delivered or minutes of content streamed  and revenue is recognized as the services are delivered 
media restoration services 
our media restoration services solutions address the need to restore and migrate legacy media archives to current media formats 
the target customers for these services include many of the customers for our digital media services as well as large legacy media archives  specifically including those found at major libraries  universities and enterprises 
we recognize revenues as services are rendered and we have no continuing involvement in the goods and services delivered  which generally is the date the finished media is shipped to the customer 
one of our key strategies is to pursue selectively strategic acquisitions or partnerships to enter new markets  expand our suite of services and product offering  increase our customer base and strengthen our market position 
since we have completed the following acquisitions streampipe 
in november  we acquired tt holding corp 
streampipe a new york company which provides enterprise webcasting technology and services 
the acquisition price was million  consisting of million of common stock issued at closing  shares  unsecured promissory notes notes aggregating million and transaction costs of million 
the notes contain an equity redemption option pursuant to which we may  at our option  satisfy our obligation under the notes by issuing additional shares of common stock 
encode this 
in june  we acquired certain assets of digital media broadcast  inc encode this a los angeles company that provides digital media services to a similar customer base that loudeye has historically serviced 
the total acquisition price was  consisting of  of the company s common stock  shares  a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of per share  and  in cash 

table of contents activate 
net 
in september  we acquired activate 
net corporation  a seattle company which provides live and on demand webcasting services for a variety of enhanced enterprise communication needs 
activate had been operated as a majority owned operating company of cmgi  inc the total acquisition price was million  million was paid in cash at closing  and we assumed million of liabilities as part of its working capital and incurred costs of million 
the remaining million of the purchase price was to be paid in stock or cash in september this remaining obligation was settled in the fourth quarter of for million in cash and  of our common stock  resulting in a gain of  addition systems 
in june  we acquired addition systems  inc  a los angeles company which develops proprietary content insertion technology 
the acquisition price was million in cash plus acquisition costs and  shares of common stock online radio 
in march and june  we acquired the assets and technology of two online radio companies  onair streaming networks and thedial 
the acquisition price was million in cash and  shares of common stock 
discovermusic 
in march  we acquired discovermusic  a seattle company which is the largest provider of music samples on the internet 
the acquisition price was million in cash plus acquisition costs and accrued liabilities  net of discovermusic s cash  and  shares of common stock 
vidipax 
in june we acquired vidipax  a new york company which performs audio and video media restoration and migration services 
the acquisition price was million in cash   shares of common stock and an additional contingent payment in july of  shares of common stock 
during and  we implemented operational consolidation and cost saving initiatives  which included the integration and realignment processes related to our acquisition activity 
as a result of these initiatives  in we consolidated our production operations from three separate facilities to the one facility acquired in the activate transaction  and implemented reductions in personnel 
details related to these initiatives are described in more detail below under the caption special charges 
we believe that as a result of these actions and additional operational and management realignment actions taken in  gross margins and operating margins should improve 
however  we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
a majority of our cost of revenues  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses are fixed 
sales commissions are variable depending upon orders booked and when revenue is recognized 
we have sustained losses on a quarterly and annual basis since inception and we expect to sustain losses for the foreseeable future as we invest in and grow our operations 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate that operating expenses  ongoing payments for the facilities that we vacated as a result of our restructurings and facility consolidation plan  continuing debt service on capital lease obligations and any acquisitions  will constitute a material use of our cash resources in and beyond 
we have incurred losses and have experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception and have an accumulated deficit 
we expect to incur additional losses and negative cash flow from operations in the foreseeable future 
these matters have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have restructured our operations  reduced employee headcount  renegotiated leases and taken other actions to limit our expenditures 
however  there can be no assurance that our cash balances will be sufficient to sustain our operations until profitable operations and positive cash flows are achieved 
consequently  we may require additional capital to fund our operations 
there can be no assurance that capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
our limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult 
in view of our limited operating history and the early and rapidly evolving nature of our business  we believe that interim and 
table of contents annual period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
our business prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties often encountered by early stage companies in the internet related products and services market 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and uncertainties 
we have experienced growth in revenues in certain previous periods  however  we do not believe that prior growth rates or possibly even sequential quarterly growth are sustainable or indicative of future growth rates see forward looking statements 
in some future quarter our operating results may fall below our expectations as well as those of securities analysts and investors 
in this event  the trading price of our common stock may fall significantly 
results of operations year ended december  compared to revenue 
revenues totaled million and million for and  respectively 
the increase reflects increases in our digital media service revenue due primarily to the acquisition of activate in september  and growth in revenue from our vidipax subsidiary 
digital media services revenue increased to million in from million in the increase was due primarily to the acquisition of activate in september the increase in enterprise communications revenue generated by activate is partially offset by the decrease in revenue generated by our encoding services  due to fewer large encoding projects in compared to  and a decrease in samples revenue from the previous year  largely a result of pricing pressures for this service 
we believe that this trend has now abated and expect revenues from encoding and samples services to remain relatively stable in media restoration revenues totaled million in  as compared to million in this increase was primarily the result of an increase in revenue generated from a significant customer 
we expect revenues generated from vidipax to remain relatively stable or modestly decline in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased to million in from million in cost of revenues include the cost of production including personnel  and an allocated portion of facilities and equipment and other supporting functions related to the delivery of digital media services and applications 
excluding depreciation and amortization  costs of revenues increased to million in from million in this was primarily due to the higher number of personnel involved in digital media services production and the increased reliance on certain third party vendors related to webcasting services 
depreciation  the primary non cash component of cost of revenues  decreased to million from million in as a result of the property and equipment write downs recorded in media restoration cost of revenues totaled million in  an increase from million in the increase rose slightly out of proportion to the increased revenues 
this is a result of the variable nature of the restoration business  which requires adding personnel to generate additional revenues 
additionally  production facility expansion at vidipax resulted in higher levels of depreciation on a comparative basis 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses totaled million and million in and  respectively 
research and development expenses include salaries and consulting fees paid to support technology development  costs of technology acquired from third parties to incorporate into applications and other proprietary technology currently under development 
the decrease is due to the significant reduction in the number of development personnel as a result of the corporate restructurings 
costs of enhancing webcasting offerings  including the recently announced loudeye express  the continued support of our music offerings and the development of internal operational solutions necessary to fully integrate previous acquisitions comprised a majority of our research and development expenses in we had approximately  in media restoration research and development expenses during primarily as a result of efforts to integrate certain acquired equipment and efficiency enhancements into the media restoration production process 
there were no research and development expenses included in media restoration services in we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
however  due to our operational restructurings and a sharper focus on opportunities which we 
table of contents believe will result in near term results  development headcount was significantly reduced as compared to and  as a result  research and development expenses declined in as compared to we expect research and development expenses to remain relatively stable in the foreseeable future 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million and million in and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  co marketing expenses  trade show expenses  product branding costs  advertising and cost of marketing collateral 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to decreased personnel subsequent to our reductions in force  partially offset by a general increase in commissions and other selling expenses to generate the increased level of sales 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in advertising and marketing activities during media restoration services sales and marketing expenses totaled  and  in and  respectively 
this decrease was due to a reduction in personnel and a general change in the sales compensation structure at vidipax 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses totaled million and million in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of rent  facilities and information technology charges  salaries  legal expenses for general corporate purposes  professional services  investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company 
general and administrative expenses increased over the previous year as a result of the impact of integrating acquisitions into our operations and higher professional fees  insurance and other costs associated with being a publicly held company 
the increase is partially offset by internal efforts beginning in the third quarter of to decrease all operating expenses  including external and internal legal fees  public relations  investor relations and insurance premiums 
our media restoration segment contributed general and administrative expenses of approximately million and in and  respectively 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will decrease in future periods as a result of our corporate restructurings and continued efforts to reduce operating expenses 
amortization of intangibles and other assets 
amortization of intangibles and other assets totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to impairment charges recorded during  which led to lower balances of intangible assets and  in turn  lower amortization charges 
in addition  effective january   we adopted fas  which stipulates that goodwill can no longer be amortized but is subject to review for impairment 
amortization expense decreased by million compared to the previous year as a result of the implementation of fas stock based compensation 
stock based compensation was a credit of  and a charge of  in and  respectively 
this decrease is a result of previous reductions in force  which has reduced the amortization of stock based compensation  and in reversals of previously recorded deferred stock compensation associated with terminated employees 
as a result of stock option cancellations associated with our reductions in force  we recorded a stock based compensation credit of  in the first quarter of the remaining charge was due to normal  recurring amortization 
future amortization of deferred stock compensation should decline as the deferred stock compensation recorded prior to our initial public offering is being amortized on an accelerated basis 
future stock based compensation charges may vary as a result of variable accounting following our option exchange in the third quarter of as of december   approximately  remains in deferred stock based compensation  which is expected to be amortized in full by the end of special charges 
we recorded special charges totaling million and million in and  respectively  related to impairment of intangible assets  write downs of property and equipment  accrued lease payments related to vacated facilities and employee severance charges associated with company restructurings 
effective january  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and determined that certain intangible assets and property and equipment related to our digital media services and enterprise communications reporting units were impaired 
in addition  as a result of a decline in revenues and other economic factors  we performed an analysis of carrying values of property plant and equipment and amortizable intangibles pursuant to sfas no 
as of november  as a result of these actions and 
table of contents other economic conditions  we recorded special charges in and which are summarized in the following table in thousands intangible and other asset impairments property and equipment write downs facilities related charges and other employee severance the following table reflects the activity in accrued special charges in thousands 
balance  beginning of year accruals paid during year balance  end of year we will continue to review the carrying value of our long lived assets and goodwill for impairments 
future adverse developments in our business will result in additional charges 
interest income 
interest income representing earnings on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in income was due to lower average cash and investment balances in  reflecting cash used for operations  as well as  the voluntary prepayment of our primary outstanding credit facility during the third quarter of  as well as lower interest rates 
our interest income will decrease in the future as our cash balances decrease to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
interest expense 
interest expense relating to our debt instruments  as well as amortization of financing charges related to our debt instruments  totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease was due to lower interest rates resulting from the new credit facility signed in october and our repayment of this facility in the third quarter of interest expense should decrease in as a result of the repayment of our long term debt 
other income expense 
other income expense consists of  of other income related to the renegotiation of the final closing terms with cmgi related to the acquisition of activate and realized gains from the sale of certain investments  partially offset by expenses incurred related to the sale of our canadian subsidiary 
on the date of our acquisition of activate  the total payment due to cmgi on september  was million in a combination of cash and stock

enterprise webcasting services contributed million in 
table of contents revenues since our acquisition of activate on september  in we generated revenues from consulting services and the sale or license of custom applications and other totaling million

cost of revenues include the cost of production including personnel  and an allocated portion of facilities and equipment and other supporting functions related to the delivery of digital media services and applications 
costs  excluding depreciation and amortization  to generate the revenues described above decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to the significantly lower number of personnel involved in digital media services production 
this reduction in headcount came as a result of the completion of our digital media archive system  which has allowed us to fulfill digital music encoding orders in a more automated manner rather than the historical method requiring significant manual processing 
the non cash component of cost of revenues  which is primarily depreciation  increased to million from million in as a result of a full year s depreciation in of our production facility 
adding to this increase was higher levels of equipment purchases throughout  contributing only a partial year of depreciation in  but a full year in cost of revenues increased from primarily due to decreased revenues and capacity utilization  as well as increased depreciation expense in from significant asset acquisitions in these increases were partially offset by the inclusion of higher margin product offerings acquired from discovermusic and vidipax

research and development expenses totaled million and million in and  respectively 
research and development expenses include salaries and consulting fees paid to support technology development  costs of technology acquired from third parties to incorporate into applications and other proprietary technology currently under development

general and administrative expenses also increased as a result of the acquisition of activate 
fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses included a reduction of  in our bonus accrual resulting from a board of directors decision in late to conserve our cash resources and not pay cash bonuses to executives and certain other employees

should our stock price increase above the new options exercise prices  there could be substantial non cash charges recorded 
special charges 
in  we commenced a series of operational restructurings and facilities consolidations 
we assessed each product and service offering and the costs related to each in making the determination 
table of contents to cease providing  or otherwise change the level of support we provide for these offerings 
we determined that it was not feasible to continue to provide or support digital media consulting services  certain digital media applications and the alive e show platform in additionally  the decision was made to decrease the level of emphasis placed on video encoding activities 
this decision was made as a response to the decreased demand for such services  which started in the third quarter of and continued into the first quarter of  at which time we determined that no further resources would be provided to support video encoding in our seattle facility 
in the second quarter of we terminated approximately of our workforce 
that reduction in force created excess facilities  resulting in the development of facilities consolidation plans 
these plans of consolidation generated additional special charges for rent accruals as well as tenant improvement impairments throughout the remainder of the continued economic conditions surrounding our digital media services led to other impairment charges related to the valuation of our assets acquired from discovermusic  in the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we performed an analysis of all long lived assets in accordance with our accounting policies  and determined that certain of these assets were impaired

fin also sets forth certain disclosures regarding interests in vie that are deemed significant  even if consolidation is not required 
we are currently assessing the application of fin in february  the eitf issued an abstract  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
specifically  this issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
we believe our current revenue recognition policies comply with the provisions of eitf no 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements by considering accounting policies and estimates that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 

table of contents long lived assets 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
when doing so  management is required evaluate the recoverability of an asset s or group of assets carrying value through estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
if the assets are deemed impaired  the assets are written down to estimated fair value 
estimates of fair value may differ from the actual amount that could be realized if we were to sell our assets 
as described in note  we recorded impairment charges of million  million and  in  and  respectively 
these amounts are included in special charges on the accompanying statements of operations 
management s assessments of the impairment of property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill are sensitive accounting estimates that could result in additional impairment charges in the near term 
factors that impact these estimates include  but are not limited to  possible changes in business plans  market price of our common stock and declining financial results 
net long term assets subject to impairment review in the future totaled million at december  we will continue to review the carrying value of our long lived assets and goodwill for impairments 
future adverse developments in our business will result in additional charges 
exit costs 
we have followed the provisions of eitf to record the costs associated with exit activities 
management is required to make its best estimates of exit costs such as remaining lease obligations and or termination fees  these estimates be different than the actual amounts that will be paid under existing lease arrangements 
as noted above  beginning january   we will follow the provisions of fas to record the costs associated with exit activities 
future adverse changes in our business could result in additional exit activities and charges 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenues primarily from two sources digital media services  licensing and selling digital media applications and media restoration services 
digital media services and other 
we recognize enterprise webcasting services revenues as services are rendered 
we recognize encoding services revenues when the services have been rendered and we have no continuing involvement in the goods and services delivered  which is generally the date the finished media is shipped to our customer 
other revenues are generated from our music samples service business and in the prior year from licensing and selling of software and through application service provider arrangements 
we sell services in application service provider arrangements 
we are required to host the applications and the customer does not have the ability to have the application hosted by another entity without penalty to the customer 
billings are made based upon quantity of content streamed  and revenue is recognized as the services are delivered 
media restoration services 
we recognize revenues as services are rendered and we have no continuing involvement in the goods and services delivered  which generally is the date the finished media is shipped to the customer 
we believe that our revenue recognition policy is consistent with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 

table of contents risk factors we have incurred losses and negative cash flow since inception and have an accumulated deficit at december   raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the company will continue to operate as a going concern 
the company has incurred losses from inception  has an accumulated deficit  and has experienced negative cash flows from operations since its inception 
these matters raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
management has restructured the company s operations  reduced its work force  renegotiated leases  and taken other actions to limit the company s expenditures 
however  there can be no assurance that company s cash balances will be sufficient to sustain its operations until profitable operations and positive cash flows are achieved 
consequently  the company may require additional capital to fund its operations 
there can be no assurance that capital will be available to the company on acceptable terms  or at all 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
we have a limited operating history  making it difficult for you to evaluate our business and your investment loudeye was formed as a limited liability company in august and incorporated in march following our acquisition of activate in  we began to place greater emphasis on our enterprise webcasting services 
we therefore still have a very limited operating history upon which an investor may evaluate our operations and future prospects  as well as limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
in addition  the revenue and income potential of our business and market are unproven 
because of the emerging nature of the industry  our executives have limited experience in it 
as a young company operating in an emerging industry  we face risks and uncertainties relating to our ability to implement our business plan successfully 
our potential for future profitability must be considered in light of these risks  uncertainties and difficulties 
our quarterly financial results will continue to fluctuate making it difficult to forecast our operating results our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including variability in demand for our webcasting services and our other digital media services and applications  market acceptance of new webcasting and other digital media services and applications offered by us and our competitors  ability of our customers to procure necessary intellectual property rights for the digital media content they intend to utilize in their businesses  willingness of our customers to enter into longer term volume digital media and applications service agreements and purchase orders in light of the economic and legal uncertainties related to their business models  governmental regulations affecting use of the internet  including regulations concerning intellectual property rights and security measures  or competition from other companies entering our markets 
our limited operating history and unproven business model further contribute to the difficulty of making meaningful quarterly comparisons and forecasts 
our current and future levels of operating expenses and 
table of contents capital expenditures are based largely on our growth plans and estimates of expected future revenues 
these expenditure levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term and our sales cycle can be lengthy 
thus  we may not be able to adjust spending or generate new revenue sources in a timely manner to compensate for any shortfall in revenues and any significant shortfall in revenues relative to planned expenditures could have an immediate adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future periods  our stock price will likely decline significantly 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  and if we are unable to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us  we may be unable to execute our business plan and current stockholders may experience significant dilution as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted investments 
there can be no assurance that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted investments will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for accordingly  if we are unable to fund operating and other expenses  working capital and capital expenditures from our operations  we may find it necessary to secure additional financing  sell assets or reduce expenditures further 
in the event additional financing is required  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to pursue our business objectives 
this inability could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced and these securities may have rights and preferences superior to that of our current stockholders 
if we raise capital through debt financing  we may be forced to accept restrictions affecting our liquidity  including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or pay dividends 
because we expect to continue to incur net losses  we may not be able to implement our business strategy and the price of our stock may decline as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have incurred net losses quarterly from august  inception through december   and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our ability to operate our business and implement our business strategy may be hampered by negative cash flows in the future  and the value of our stock may decline as a result 
our capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned if  for example  we incur unforeseen capital expenditures  unforeseen operating expenses or make investments to maintain our competitive position 
if this is the case  we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development plans or otherwise forego market opportunities 
we will need to generate significant additional revenues to be profitable in the future and we may not generate sufficient revenues to be profitable on either a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
to address the risks an uncertainties facing our business strategy  we must  among other things achieve broad customer adoption and acceptance of our products and services  successfully integrate our acquisition of tt holdings and execute our webcasting services strategy  successfully integrate  leverage and expand our sales force  successfully scale our current operations  implement and execute our business and marketing strategies  address copyright issues that effect our business  develop and maintain strategic relationships to enhance our products and services  respond to competitive developments in the digital media infrastructure industry  
table of contents we might not be successful in achieving any or all of these objectives in a cost effective manner  if at all  and the failure to achieve these could have a serious adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial position 
each of these objectives may require significant additional expenditures on our part 
even if we ultimately do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
if we are unable to comply with nasdaq s continued listing requirements  our common stock could be desisted from the nasdaq smallcap market since july   our common stock has failed to maintain a minimum bid price of per share for at least consecutive days  which caused our stock price to fail to meet one of the minimum standards required by the nasdaq stock market for continued listing as a nasdaq national market security 
in order to avoid delisting from nasdaq entirely  we voluntarily applied to nasdaq to have our listing transferred to the smallcap market 
on july  our application was approved to transfer the listing of our common stock to the nasdaq smallcap market 
the nasdaq smallcap market also requires compliance with a minimum bid price of per share for at least consecutive days 
we were notified that we must be in compliance with this requirement by march  including all grace periods or face delisting from nasdaq 
on march  we were notified by nasdaq that we will be provided an additional calendar days  or until june  to regain compliance 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy all requirements for continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market  including the minimum bid price requirement and minimum tangible assets or stockholders equity requirements 
if we are unable to meet nasdaq requirements in the future  our stock will be subject to delisting  which may have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity currently available to our stockholders 
delisting would also make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future 
if our common stock is removed from the nasdaq smallcap market  an investor could find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of  our common shares 
additionally  our stock may then be subject to penny stock regulations 
our success is dependent on the performance and retention of our executive officers and key employees our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees  all of whom are employed on an at will basis and have worked together for only a relatively short period of time 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers 
in addition  we have hired or named new employees in in key executive positions  including jeffrey cavins  our chief executive 
the loss of one or several key executives could seriously harm our business 
any reorganization or reduction in the size of our employee base could harm our ability to attract and retain other valuable employees critical to the success of our business 
acquisitions we have made or may make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition we expect to continue to evaluate and acquire businesses  technologies  services  or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
in june we acquired vidipax  inc  in june we acquired addition systems  inc  in march we acquired discovermusic  and in september we acquired activate 
and we have also acquired certain assets and technology from onair and thedial 
com 
pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dates as of may   the company acquired certain assets of encodethis  inc pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  the company acquired certain assets of encodethis  inc in exchange for cash and common stock  as well as a warrant to purchase common stock of the company 
on november   the company  tentv acquisition corp  a delaware corporation wholly owned by the company  and tt holding corp 
holding  a delaware corporation and sole shareholder of technology education network  inc tentv entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization the merger agreement 
pursuant to the merger agreement  tentv acquisition corp 
was merged into holding and the former stockholders of holding received  subject to the merger agreement and certain 
table of contents unsecured promissory notes with equity redemption option the notes   newly issued unregistered shares of the company s common stock and notes in the aggregate original principal amount of  at december    shares had been issued and  shares are being held in escrow until january   pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement 
subject to the terms of each note  which provide in part that there is not an event of default and that the company is listed on a principal exchange excluding the over the counter market  the notes may be redeemed  at the option of the company  for common stock of the company 
in the event that the company elects to redeem the notes for common stock  the number of shares issuable upon redemption shall be calculated by dividing i the principal amount and all accrued interest due under the notes as of the date of redemption  by ii the average of the last sale price of the common stock for the thirty trading days preceding january  in such event  the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be in excess of twenty percent of the issued and outstanding common stock of the company 
nasdaq rules require that the a majority of the company s stockholders approve any transaction resulting in the issuance of twenty percent or more of the company s common stock 
we have limited operating history as a combined company and therefore limited experience in addressing emerging trends that may affect our combined business 
the integration of these and any future acquisitions into our operations may place a significant strain on our employees  systems and other resources 
if any acquisition fails to integrate well  our operations and financial position could be harmed 
acquisitions require integrating the business  personnel  technology and products of the acquired entity and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
in addition  acquisitions may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will be realized 
acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  the assumption of known and unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business  or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets and the incurrence of large and immediate write offs  any of which could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent on the development and rate of adoption of digital media and the delay or failure of this development would seriously harm our business we are dependent on the development and rate of adoption of digital media services and applications and the delay or failure of this development would seriously harm our business 
the development of commercial services and applications for digital media content is in its relatively early stages 
if the internet does not develop as an effective medium for the distribution of digital media content to consumers or if businesses predicated on the distribution of digital media content are not profitable or are unable to raise necessary operating capital  then we may not succeed in executing our business plan 
many factors could inhibit the growth of the distribution of digital media content  including concerns about the profitability of internet related businesses  uncertainty about intellectual property rights associated with music and other digital media  bandwidth constraints  piracy and privacy 
our success depends on users having access to the necessary hardware  software and bandwidth  or data transmission capability  to receive and broadcast high quality digital media over the internet 
congestion over the internet and data loss may interrupt audio and video streams  resulting in unsatisfying user experiences 
the success of digital media distribution over the internet depends on the continued rollout of broadband access to consumers on an affordable basis 
widespread adoption of digital media technology depends on overcoming obstacles to the deployment and use of digital media software  identifying additional viable revenue models for digital media based businesses  improving audio and video quality and educating customers and users in the use of digital media technology 
if digital media technology fails to overcome these obstacles  our business could be seriously harmed 
because digital recorded music formats  such as mp  do not always contain mechanisms for tracking the source or ownership of digital recordings  users are able to download and distribute unauthorized or pirated copies of copyrighted recorded music over the internet 
this piracy is a significant concern to record 
table of contents companies and artists  and is the reason many record companies and artists are reluctant to digitally deliver their recorded music over the internet 
as long as pirated recordings are available  many consumers will choose free pirated recordings rather than paying for legitimate recordings 
accordingly  if this issue is not addressed  our business might be harmed 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a majority of our revenues so the loss of  or delay in payment from  one or a small number of customers could have a significant impact on our revenues and operating results a limited number of customers have accounted for a majority of our revenues and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
during the year ended december   two of our customers accounted for of our revenues and during the year ended december   one of our customers accounted for approximately of our revenues 
we believe that a small number of customers may continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
due to high revenue concentration among a limited number of customers  the cancellation  reduction or delay of a large customer order or our failure to timely complete or deliver a project during a given quarter is likely to significantly reduce revenues 
in addition  if any significant customer fails to pay amounts it owes us  or does not pay those amounts on time  our revenues and operating results could suffer 
if we are unsuccessful in increasing and broadening our customer base  our business could be harmed 
average selling prices of our products and services may decrease  which may harm our gross margins the average selling prices of our products and services may be lower than expected as a result of competitive pricing pressures  promotional programs and customers who negotiate price reductions in exchange for longer term purchase commitments or otherwise 
the pricing of services sold to our customers depends on the duration of the agreement  the specific requirements of the order  purchase volumes  the sales and service support and other contractual agreements 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience pricing pressure and anticipate that the average selling prices and gross margins for our products will decrease over product life cycles 
we may not be successful in developing and introducing on a timely basis new products with enhanced features that can be sold at higher gross margins 
we may be liable or alleged to be liable to third parties for music  software  and other content that we encode  distribute  or make available on to our customers we may be liable or alleged to be liable to third parties for the content that we encode  distribute or make available to our customers if the content or the performance of our services violates third party copyright  trademark  or other intellectual property rights  if our customers violate the intellectual property rights of others by providing content to us or by having us perform digital media services  or if content that we encode or otherwise handle for our customers is deemed obscene  indecent  or defamatory 
any alleged liability could harm our business by damaging our reputation  requiring us to incur legal costs in defense  exposing us to awards of damages and costs and diverting management s attention which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our customers for encoding services generally agree to hold us harmless from claims arising from their failure to have the right to encode the content given to us for that purpose 
however  customers may contest this responsibility or not have sufficient resources to defend claims and we have limited insurance coverage for claims of this nature 
because we host  stream and webcast audio and video content on or from our web site and on other web sites for customers and provide services related to digital media content  we face potential liability or alleged liability for negligence  infringement of copyright  patent  or trademark rights  defamation  indecency and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials we host 
claims of this nature have been 
table of contents brought  and sometimes successfully pressed  against content distributors 
in addition  we could be exposed to liability with respect to the unauthorized duplication of content or unauthorized use of other parties proprietary technology 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage or any alleged liability could harm our business 
we cannot assure you that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to past  current  or future technologies 
the music industry in particular has recently been the focus of infringement claims 
we expect that participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in our industry segment grows 
in addition  these risks are difficult to quantify in light of the continuously evolving nature of laws and regulations governing the internet 
any claim relating to proprietary rights  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause service upgrade delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  and we can not assure you that we will have adequate insurance coverage or that royalty or licensing agreements will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our intellectual property  and we may be found to infringe on proprietary rights of others  which could harm our business our intellectual property is important to our business  and we seek to protect our intellectual property through copyrights  trademarks  patents  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions in our customer  supplier and strategic relationship agreements  nondisclosure agreements with third parties  and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors 
we cannot assure you that measures we take to protect our intellectual property will be successful or that third parties will not develop alternative solutions that do not infringe upon our intellectual property 
in addition  we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by others 
potential customers may be deterred from distributing content over the internet for fear of infringement claims 
the music industry in particular has recently been the focus of heightened concern with respect to copyright infringement and other misappropriation claims  and the outcome of developing legal standards in that industry is expected to impact music  video and other content being distributed over the internet 
if  as a result  potential customers forego distributing traditional media content over the internet  demand for our digital media services and applications could be reduced which would harm our business 
the music industry in the us is generally regarded as extremely litigious in nature compared to other industries and we could become engaged in litigation with others in the music industry 
claims against us  and any resultant litigation  should it occur in regard to any of our digital media services and applications  could subject us to significant liability for damages including treble damages for willful infringement 
in addition  even if we prevail  litigation could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and attention 
any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims 
further  we plan to offer our digital media services and applications to customers worldwide including customers in foreign countries that may offer less protection for our intellectual property than the united states 
our failure to protect against misappropriation of our intellectual property  or claims that we are infringing the intellectual property of third parties could have a negative effect on our business  revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
a class action lawsuit has been filed against us which may result in litigation that is costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain and may harm our business we and certain of our current or former officers and directors are named as defendants in a purported class action complaint which has been filed allegedly on behalf of certain persons who purchased our common stock during the time period beginning on march  and ending on december  the complaint alleges violations of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of primarily it alleges that there was undisclosed compensation received by our underwriters in connection with our initial public offering 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this matter 
any resolution of this matter in a manner adverse to us could have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operation 
in addition  the costs to us of defending any litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be 
table of contents substantial 
such litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation or other proceedings could harm our ability to compete in the marketplace 
in addition  because class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in their stock prices  we could become involved in additional litigation 
we rely on strategic relationships to promote our services and for access to licensed technology  if we fail to maintain or enhance these relationships  our ability to serve our customers and develop new services and applications could be harmed our ability to provide our services to users of multiple technologies and platforms depends significantly on our ability to develop and maintain our strategic relationships with key streaming media technology companies and content providers 
we rely on these relationships for licensed technology and content 
we also rely on relationships with major recording labels for our music content licensing strategy 
obtaining comprehensive music content licenses is challenging  as doing so may require us to obtain copyright licenses with various third parties in the fragmented music recording and publishing industries 
these copyrights often address differing activities related to the delivery of digital media  including reproduction and performance  some of which may require separate licensing arrangements from various rights holders such as publishers  artists and record labels 
the effort to obtain the necessary rights by such third parties is often significant  and could disrupt  delay  or prevent us from executing our business plans 
because of the large number of potential parties from which we must obtain licenses  we may never be able to obtain a sufficient number of licenses to allow us to provide services that will meet our customers expectations 
due to the evolving nature of our industry  we will need to develop additional relationships to adapt to changing technologies and standards and to work with newly emerging companies with whom we do not have pre existing relationships 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in developing new relationships or that our partners will view these relationships as significant to their own business or that they will continue their commitment to us in the future 
if we are unable to maintain or enhance these relationships  we may have difficulty strengthening our technology development and increasing the adoption of our brand and services 
our music content licenses could result in operational complexity that may divert resources or make our business more expensive to conduct the large number of licenses that we need to maintain in order to expand our music related services creates operational difficulties in connection with tracking the rights that we have acquired and the complex royalty structures under which we must pay 
in addition  our licensing agreements typically allow the third party to audit our royalty tracking and payment mechanisms to ensure that we are accurately reporting and paying the royalties owed 
if we are unable to accurately track the numerous parties that we must pay in connection with each delivery of digital music services and deliver the appropriate payment in a timely fashion  we may risk termination of certain licenses 
competition may decrease our market share  revenues  and gross margins we face intense and increasing competition in the digital media services market 
if we do not compete effectively or if we experience reduced market share from increased competition  our business will be harmed 
in addition  the more successful we are in the emerging market for digital media services  the more competitors are likely to emerge 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include service functionality  quality and performance  ease of use  reliability  scalability and security of services  establishing a significant base of customers and distribution partners  ability to introduce new services to the market in a timely manner  
table of contents customer service and support  attracting third party web developers  and pricing 
although we do not currently compete against any one entity with respect to all aspects of our digital media services  there are two principal types of companies we do compete with enterprise webcasting companies and digital media services companies 
enterprise webcasting competition 
our primary competitors are content distribution networks  such as akamai  and internet broadcasters  such as yahoo broadcast 
each of these companies provide services similar to ours and each has a well established market presence 
we also compete with providers of traditional communications technologies  such as teleconferencing and videoconferencing  as well as applications software and tools companies  such as centra software  lotus sametime  microsoft netmeeting and placeware 
there are also smaller competitors that focus on certain of our individual market segments  such as investor relations webcasts 
other digital media services competition 
there are a number of companies that provide outsourced digital media services 
as the digital media services market continues to develop  we expect to see increased competition from traditional telecommunication service providers or resellers of those services 
we also face competition from the in house encoding services  streaming networks and content management systems and encoding services 
many of our competitors have substantially more capital  longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may also engage in more extensive development of their technologies  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and establish more comprehensive marketing and advertising campaigns than we can 
our competitors may develop products and service offerings that we do not offer or that are more sophisticated or more cost effective than our own 
for these and other reasons  our competitors products and services may achieve greater acceptance in the marketplace than our own  limiting our ability to gain market share and customer loyalty and to generate sufficient revenues to achieve a profitable level of operations 
our failure to adequately address any of the above factors could harm our business and operating results 
our industry is experiencing consolidation that may intensify competition the internet and digital media services industries are undergoing substantial change that has resulted in increasing consolidation and a proliferation of strategic transactions 
many companies in these industries have been going out of business or are being acquired by larger entities 
as a result  we are increasingly competing with larger competitors that have substantially greater resources than we do 
we expect this consolidation and strategic partnering to continue 
acquisitions or strategic relationships could harm us in a number of ways 
for example competitors could acquire or enter into relationships with companies with which we have strategic relationships and discontinue our relationship  resulting in the loss of distribution opportunities for our products and services or the loss of certain enhancements or value added features to our products and services  competitors could obtain exclusive access to desirable multimedia content and prevent that content from being available in certain formats  thus decreasing the use of our products and services to distribute and experience the content that audiences most desire  and hurting our ability to attract customers  suppliers of important or emerging technologies could be acquired by a competitor or other company which could prevent us from being able to utilize such technologies in our offerings  and disadvantage our offerings relative to those of competitors  
table of contents a competitor could be acquired by a party with significant resources and experience that could increase the ability of the competitor to compete with our products and services  and other companies with related interests could combine to form new  formidable competition  which could preclude us from obtaining access to certain markets or content  or which could dramatically change the market for our products and services 
any of these results could put us at a competitive disadvantage that could cause us to lose customers  revenue and market share 
they could also force us to expend greater resources to meet the competitive threat  which could also harm our operating results 
if we fail to enhance our existing services and applications products or develop and introduce new digital media services  applications and features in a timely manner to meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry trends or standards  our ability to grow our business will suffer the market for digital media service solutions is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and short product life cycles 
these market characteristics are heightened by the emerging nature of the internet and the continuing trend of companies from many industries to offer internet based applications and services 
the widespread adoption of the new internet  networking  streaming media  or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our operating practices or infrastructure 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to obtain the necessary intellectual property rights from music companies and other content owners to be able to legally provide our services  identify and respond to emerging technological trends in the market  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our digital media services and applications from those of our competitors  acquire and license leading technologies  bring digital media services and applications to market and scale our business on a timely basis at competitive prices  and respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
we will not be competitive unless we continually introduce new services and applications or enhancements to existing services and applications that meet evolving industry standards and customer needs 
in the future  we may not be able to address effectively the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards 
the technical innovations required for us to remain competitive are inherently complex  require long development schedules and are dependent in some cases on sole source suppliers 
we will be required to continue to invest in research and development in order to attempt to maintain and enhance our existing technologies and products  but we may not have the funds available to do so 
even if we have sufficient funds  these investments may not serve the needs of customers or be compatible with changing technological requirements or standards 
most development expenses must be incurred before the technical feasibility or commercial viability of new or enhanced services and applications can be ascertained 
revenue from future services and applications or enhancements to services and applications may not be sufficient to recover the associated development costs 
the technology underlying our services and applications is complex and may contain unknown defects that could harm our reputation  result in product liability or decrease market acceptance of our services and applications the technology underlying our digital media services and applications is complex and includes software that is internally developed and software licensed from third parties 
these software products may contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
we may not discover software defects that affect our current or new services and applications or enhancements 
table of contents until after they are sold 
furthermore  because our digital media services are designed to work in conjunction with various platforms and applications  we are susceptible to errors or defects in third party applications that can result in a lower quality product for our customers 
because our customers depend on us for digital media management  any interruptions could damage our reputation  cause our customers to initiate product liability suits against us  increase our product development resources  cause us to lose sales  and delay market acceptance of our digital media services and applications 
we do not possess product liability insurance  and our errors and omissions coverage is not likely to be sufficient to cover our complete liability exposure 
our business will suffer if our systems fail or our operations facilities become unavailable a reduction in the performance  reliability and availability of our systems and network infrastructure may harm our ability to distribute our products and services to our customers and other users  as well as harm our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers and content providers 
our systems and operations are susceptible to  and could be damaged or interrupted by  outages caused by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  internet breakdown  earthquake and similar events 
we do not have any redundancy in our webcasting facilities and therefore any damage or destruction to these would significantly harm our webcasting business 
our systems are also subject to human error  security breaches  power losses  computer viruses  break ins  denial of service attacks  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism and tampering designed to disrupt our computer systems  web sites and network communications 
a sudden and significant increase in traffic on our web sites could strain the capacity of the software  hardware and telecommunications systems that we deploy or use 
this could lead to slower response times or system failures 
our operations also depend on receipt of timely feeds from our content providers  and any failure or delay in the transmission or receipt of such feeds could disrupt our operations 
we also depend on web browsers  isps and online service providers to provide access over the internet to our product and service offerings 
many of these providers have experienced significant outages or interruptions in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
these types of interruptions could continue or increase in the future 
our digital distribution activities are managed by sophisticated software and computer systems 
we must continually develop and update these systems over time as our business and business needs grow and change  and these systems may not adequately reflect the current needs of our business 
we may encounter delays in developing these systems  and the systems may contain undetected errors that could cause system failures 
any system error or failure that causes interruption in availability of products or content or an increase in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing business services customers  users  advertisers or content providers 
if we suffer sustained or repeated interruptions  our products  services and web sites could be less attractive to such entities or individuals and our business could be harmed 
significant portions of our business are dependent on providing customers with efficient and reliable services to enable customers to broadcast content to large audiences on a live or on demand basis 
our operations are dependent in part upon transmission capacity provided by third party telecommunications network providers 
any failure of such network providers to provide the capacity we require may result in a reduction in  or interruption of  service to our customers 
if we do not have access to third party transmission capacity  we could lose customers and if we are unable to obtain such capacity on terms commercially acceptable to us  our business and operating results could suffer 
our computer and communications infrastructure is located at a single leased facility in seattle  washington  an area that is at heightened risk of earthquake and volcanic events 
we do not have fully 
table of contents redundant systems  and we may not have adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur from a system outage 
despite our efforts  our network infrastructure and systems could be subject to service interruptions or damage and any resulting interruption of services could harm our business  operating results and reputation 
because our principal stockholders and management may have the ability to control a significant percentage of stockholder votes  the premium over market price that an acquiror might otherwise pay may be reduced and any merger or takeover may be prevented or delayed our officers and directors beneficially own or control the voting of approximately of our outstanding common stock 
martin tobias  our former chief executive officer and former member of the board of directors  has given the board of directors  an irrevocable proxy to vote all of the approximately million shares of our common stock that he owns 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements and our report on form k as filed with the securities and exchange commission on october  for a more complete description of the proxy 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  have the ability to substantially influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including election or removal of our board of directors  amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  and adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger  takeover or other business combination involving us 
these stockholders have substantial influence over our management and our affairs 
accordingly  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business consolidation involving us  or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares 
this concentration of ownership could also adversely affect our stock s market price or lessen any premium over market price that an acquiror might otherwise pay 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the provisions of delaware law could also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing an acquisition of loudeye  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
see description of capital stock for more information on our charter and by law provisions 
government regulation could adversely affect our business prospects we do not know with certainty how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyright and other intellectual property issues  taxation  illegal or obscene content  retransmission of media  personal privacy and data protection will apply to the internet or to the distribution of music and other proprietary content over the internet 
most of these laws were adopted before the advent of the internet and related technologies and therefore do not address the unique issues associated with the internet and related technologies 
depending on how these laws developed and are interpreted by the judicial system  they could have the effect of limiting the growth of the internet  creating uncertainty in the marketplace that could reduce demand for our products and services  increasing our cost of doing business  exposing us to significant liabilities associated with content distributed or accessed through our products or services  or leading to increased product and applications development costs  or otherwise harm our business 
specifically with respect to one aspect of copyright law  on october   the digital millennium copyright act or dmca was enacted 
the dmca includes statutory licenses for the performance of sound recordings and for the making of recordings to facilitate transmissions 
under these statutory licenses  
table of contents depending on our future business activities  we and our customers may be required to pay licensing fees in connection with digital sound recordings we deliver or our customers provide on their web site and through retransmissions of radio broadcasts and or other audio content 
a copyright arbitration royalty panel has determined that  for eligible non subscription services  sound recording performance rates should be per performance for the period october  with a surcharge of of the total performance fee for the ephemeral copies used to facilitate such performances 
however  that decision is subject to review and revision by the us copyright office  and several appeal petitions have been filed 
furthermore  the copyright office s review is subject to an appeal to a federal court of appeals 
the fees for the same types of transmissions offered on a subscription basis have not been determined and will be the subject of another copyright arbitration royalty panel proceeding  as will fees for digital phono record deliveries pursuant to the mechanical license provisions of the us copyright act 
depending on the rates and terms adopted for the statutory licenses  our business could be harmed both by increasing our own cost of doing business  and by increasing the cost of doing business for our customers 
because of this rapidly evolving and uncertain regulatory environment  both domestically and internationally  we cannot predict how existing or proposed laws and regulations might affect our business 
in addition  these uncertainties make it difficult to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations governing digital music 
these laws and regulations could harm us by subjecting us to liability or forcing us to change our business 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide internet media infrastructure services and applications 
our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the stock market 
as substantially all sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our services less competitive in foreign markets 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge our risks 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since substantially all of our investments are in short term instruments with original maturities of less than six months 
due to the limited duration of our short term investments and their investment grade level  we anticipate no material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are presented 
we invest in investment grade government obligations  institutional money market funds and other obligations with fdic insured us banks 
concentration is limited to in any one instrument or issuer 
our primary investment focus is to preserve capital and earn a market rate of return on our investments 
we do not speculate nor invest in publicly traded equity securities and therefore do not believe that our capital is subject to significant market risk 
the average portfolio balance must remain under one year in duration
