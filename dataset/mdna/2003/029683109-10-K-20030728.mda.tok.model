focus on mid market 
we have defined as mid market those corporations or divisions of corporations that have annual revenues ranging from million to billion 
organizations of this size fit our historical customer profile  and are prime candidates for the purchase and use of our unique full suite of integrated products 
increase penetration of international markets

we intend to expand our international presence by using our direct sales personnel to address international markets and creating additional relationships with distributors in europe  latin america and the asia pacific region 
expand strategic relationships 
logility intends to expand the depth and number of strategic relationships with leading enterprise software  systems integrators and service providers to integrate the logility voyager solutions suite into their services and products and to create joint marketing opportunities

the extent of our backlog is accounted for in deferred revenues refer to note b in notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are not reliant on government customers 

table of contents integrated system design while customers can use our software applications individually  we have designed them to be combined as integrated systems to meet unique customer requirements 
the user may select virtually any combination of modules to form an integrated solution for a particular business problem 
the license for such a solution could range from one single module to a multi module  multiple user solution incorporating the full range of our products 
customers frequently require services beyond those provided by our standard support maintenance agreement 
to meet those customers needs  we established a separate professional services division that provides specialized business and software implementation consulting  custom programming  on site installation  system to system interfacing and extensive training 
we provide these services  frequently referred to as systems integration services  for an additional fee normally under a separate contract  based upon time and materials utilized 
marketing and sales we market our products through direct and indirect sales channels 
we conduct our principal sales and marketing activities from corporate headquarters in atlanta  georgia  and have sales and or support offices in boston  chicago  dallas  and pittsburgh 
we manage sales channels outside of north america from our international offices in the united kingdom  france  and spain 
in addition to the marketing license agreement between american software and logility  discussed in item of this report  logility has a number of marketing alliances  including those with ibm  insight  microsoft great plains  new breed  and ssa global technologies 
generally  these marketing alliance agreements provide the vendors with non exclusive rights to market our products and access to our marketing materials and product training 
some highlights of these agreements are as follows ibm logility entered into an agreement with ibm in pursuant to which it modified its supply chain products  with ibm s technical and financial assistance  to operate with ibm s eserver iseries as platform 
also  logility agreed to market and support the ibm compatible supply chain products that resulted from our efforts 
ibm may also market our supply chain products and refer potential customers to logility 
ssa global technologies in november  logility granted ssa global technologies ssa a worldwide  non exclusive license to name  package  market  distribute and supply the logility voyager solutions suite as bpcs collaborative commerce powered by logility

in exchange  ssa agreed to use all reasonable efforts to promote and sell the software 
in fiscal  logility and ssa amended this agreement to provide for a minimum net license fee commitment of million to be paid to logility during fiscal year in addition to these marketing alliances  we have developed a network of international agents who assist in selling our products in countries 
we intend to utilize these and future relationships with software and service organizations to enhance our sales and marketing position 
these independent distributors and resellers located in central america  europe and the asia pacific region distribute our product lines in foreign countries 
these vendors typically sell their own consulting and systems integration services in conjunction with licensing our products 
to support our direct sales force  we conduct marketing programs that include public relations  direct marketing  advertising  trade shows  product seminars  industry speakers  user group conferences and ongoing customer communication programs 
the price for our products typically is determined based upon the number of modules licensed and the number of servers  users and sites for which the solution is designed 
during the fiscal year ended april   license fees generally ranged from approximately  to million 

table of contents licenses like many business application software firms  we typically enter into license agreements that grant non exclusive rights to use our products 
our standard license agreements contain provisions designed to prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of our software 
these agreements warrant that our products will function in accordance with the specifications set forth in our product documentation 
these licenses generally limit the use of the software to a specific number of individual users and servers for a one time fee 
a significant portion of the license fee is generally payable upon the delivery of product documentation  with the balance due upon installation 
services and support we offer a full range of services that allow our customers to maximize the benefits of our software products including project management  implementation  product education  technical consulting  programming  system integration  network management and maintenance and support 
the customer receives documentation manuals or imbedded help software  which describe the system s features and its method of operation 
we continually enhance and improve our software products to accommodate technological changes and other factors that may affect the customer s information requirements 
we price our services separately  and generally do not include fees for our services in the price of our software products 
to receive maintenance and enhancements from us customers must pay fees that are based on a percentage of the then current price of the product 
as a part of our support service  we provide experienced application and data processing personnel to answer telephone inquiries on a hours a day  seven days a week basis  and furnish consulting support in implementing and maintaining our systems 
in addition  we make training courses and documentation materials available to train personnel and update them on new system features 
research and development we are committed to the development and acquisition of new products and to the continued enhancement of our existing products 
we expensed approximately  for research and development in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal in addition  we capitalized  in software developments during fiscal year   in fiscal  and  in in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
our internal product development and enhancements of existing products include two categories research and development expenditures and additions to capitalized computer software development costs 
these combined categories totaled  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal  and represented of total revenues in fiscal  of total revenues in fiscal  and of total revenues in fiscal we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products  respond to changing customer requirements  develop and introduce new or enhanced products and keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
we focus our development efforts on several areas  including  but not limited to  enhancing operability of our products across distributed and changing heterogeneous hardware platforms  operating systems and relational databases and adding functionality to existing products 
these development efforts will continue to focus on deploying applications within a multi tiered supply chain environment  including the internet 
we believe that our client server and internet based solutions  which utilize the latest technologies  will be important for our long term growth 
as of april   we employed persons in product research  development and enhancement activities 

table of contents competition the market for enterprise applications is intensely competitive  rapidly changing and significantly affected by new product offerings and other market activities 
in the application software market  we compete with a variety of software vendors including internet application vendors in the enterprise application software market segment  vendors in the manufacturing software application market segment  vendors in the emerging enterprise resource optimization software solutions market segment  providers of human resource management system software products  providers of financial management systems software products  internal development efforts by corporate information technology departments  and numerous other firms that offer products and services with new or advanced features 
in particular  approximately six firms that market mainframe application software products and over thirty firms that market midrange and client server application software products are significant competitors for one or more of our products 
as a result  the market for business application software and related services has been and continues to be intensely competitive 
some competitors have become more aggressive with their prices and payment terms and issuance of contractual implementation terms or guarantees 
we may be unable to continue to compete successfully with new and existing competitors without lowering prices or offering favorable terms 
in addition  we believe we must differentiate ourselves through architectural and technological factors 
some of our competitors may have an advantage over us due to their significant worldwide presence  longer operating and product development history  substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than ours  and larger installed base 
furthermore  potential customers may consider outsourcing options  including application service providers  data center outsourcing and service bureau as viable alternatives to licensing our software products 
we believe that purchasers of software products when comparing our products and services to those of our competitors  are principally concerned with the range of product modules available  ease of integration  variety of features  performance  simplicity of use  documentation  technical support and training 
we further believe that our software products and services are competitive in these areas 
price considerations are a key factor and we believe our pricing is competitive 
we believe the continuing market trend to open systems  allowing software to operate across hardware platforms  will increase the number of competitors and intensity of competition 
we believe that it is necessary for us to expend significant development funds annually to remain competitive in the marketplace 
proprietary rights and licenses we seek to protect our proprietary interest in software products and trade secrets 
we maintain non disclosure and confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with customers  consultants  employees and others 
while we cannot assure the strict enforceability of such agreements  we believe that they 
table of contents provide a deterrent to the use of information that may be proprietary to us 
in the event of any breach of such agreements  we intend to take appropriate legal action 
we copyright our programs and software documentation related to these programs 
the source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work 
generally  copyrights on our products expire years after the year of first publication of each product 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and customers and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  we have registered certain trademarks and other trademarks have registration applications pending 
we provide our software products to customers under non exclusive license agreements 
as is customary in the software industry  in order to protect our intellectual property rights  we do not sell or transfer title to our products to our customers 
although the license agreements place restrictions on the customer s use of our products  unauthorized use of our products nevertheless may occur 
existing copyright laws afford only limited protection of our intellectual property 
moreover  the laws of some countries in which our software products are or may be licensed do not protect our software products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we believe that the rapid technological change in the computer software industry has made trade secret and copyright protection less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of our employees  frequent software product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of our support services 
despite measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and expensive 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights to the extent that unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in the future  we may increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segment overlaps 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
any such claims against us  with or without merit  can be time consuming and expensive to defend  prosecute or resolve 
moreover  an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non infringing technology  require a substantial amount of attention from management  require disputed rights to be licensed from others  require us to enter into royalty arrangements or require us to cease the marketing or use of certain products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
to the extent that we are required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others there can be no assurance that any such licenses will remain acceptable to us  if at all 
employees as of april   we had full time employees  including in product research  development and enhancement  in customer support  in professional services  in marketing  sales and sales support  and in accounting  facilities and administration 
we believe that our continued success will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical  marketing and management personnel  who may be in great demand 
we have never had a work stoppage and no employees are represented under collective bargaining arrangements 
we consider our employee relations to be excellent
