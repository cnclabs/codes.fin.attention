item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview cytyc designs  develops  manufactures and markets a sample preparation system for medical diagnostic applications 
our thinprep system allows for the automated preparation of cervical cell specimens on microscope slides for use in cervical cancer screening  as well as for the automated preparation of other cell specimens on microscope slides for use in general  non gynecological testing applications 
the thinprep system  which was cleared for marketing as a replacement for the conventional pap smear method for cervical cancer screening by the fda in  is designed to reduce the incidence of false negative diagnoses  improve slide quality  reduce inconclusive and inadequate slide samples and enable a single sample to be used for additional diagnostic testing 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial conditions and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we continuously evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of long lived assets  deferred taxes and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  revenue is not recognized from sales transactions unless the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we assess the likelihood of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if it is determined that the collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
additionally  we do not recognize revenue from sales of processors when we have an obligation to perform installation and training which is deemed to be critical to the functionality of the processor eg due to fda requirements until completion of the required installation and training 
in instances where installation and training are not deemed to be critical to the functionality of the processor  we estimate and accrue the cost to provide such installation and training and recognize those costs when the related revenue is recognized 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
valuation of long lived assets and deferred taxes 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if it is determined that the carrying value of intangible  long lived assets and goodwill might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method 
no such impairment charges have been recorded to date 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we ceased amortization of goodwill 
this had the effect of eliminating goodwill amortization of  in our statement of income 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an impairment review annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
based on our 
table of contents annual impairment review during  the carrying amount of goodwill did not exceed its fair value and  accordingly  no impairment loss exists 
we have determined that there are no indicators requiring further impairment review in at december   we have million of intangible assets  of which million represents goodwill 
an impairment to our intangible assets could result in a material  non cash expense in our consolidated statement of income 
we have not recorded any impairment charges in any of the past three years 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions  to fully recover the net carrying value of the assets 
if these estimates  and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of income 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
the above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

results of operations years ended december  and net sales increased to million in from million for  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to increased sales of our thinprep pap test for cervical cancer screening in the united states  reflecting strong end user physician demand 
the rate of growth in net sales decreased in compared to due primarily to changes in inventory management by some of our laboratory customers  which impacted their ordering patterns during gross profit increased to million in from million for  an increase of 
the gross margin decreased to in as compared to for  primarily due to lower average selling prices in the first quarter of related to sales promotion discounts and to a lesser extent a larger percentage of total revenue with international customers who have lower average selling prices
