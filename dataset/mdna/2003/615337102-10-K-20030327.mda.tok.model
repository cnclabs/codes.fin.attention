general discussion of factors affecting profitability the company derives its revenues principally from i premiums on individual life insurance  ii insurance  administrative and surrender charges on universal life and annuity products  iii asset management fees from separate account and mutual fund products  iv net investment income on general account assets  v the group pension profits which ceased as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements  and vi commissions from securities and insurance brokerage operations 
the company s expenses consist of insurance benefits provided to policyholders  interest credited on policyholders account balances  dividends to policyholders  the cost of selling and servicing the various products sold by the company  including commissions to sales representatives net of any deferrals and general business expenses 
the company s profitability depends in large part upon i price movements and trends in the securities markets  ii the amount of its assets and its third party assets under management  iii the adequacy of its product pricing which is primarily a function of competitive conditions  management s ability to assess and manage trends in mortality and morbidity experience as compared to the level of benefit payments  and its ability to maintain expenses within pricing assumptions  iv supply and demand for the kinds of products and services offered by the company see note to the consolidated financial statements for the principal products and services offered by the company  v the maintenance of the company s target spreads between 
table of contents credited rates on policyholders account balances and the rate of earnings on its investments  vi the amount of time purchasers of our insurance and annuity products hold and renew their contracts with us referred to as persistency  which affects our ability to recover the costs incurred to sell such policies and contracts  vii the ability to manage the market and credit risks associated with its invested assets  viii returns on venture capital investments  ix the investment performance of its mutual fund and variable product offerings  and x commission and fee revenue from securities brokerage and investment banking operations which fluctuate with trading volume 
external factors  such as general economic conditions and the securities markets  as well as legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products  may also affect the company s profitability 
in addition  downgrades of the claims paying ability ratings of our insurance subsidiaries by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations may affect our ability to compete in the marketplace for our products and services 
similarly  downgrades of mony group s credit ratings may affect our ability to access the debt markets to raise additional capital  which could affect the company s liquidity and ability to support the capital of our insurance subsidiaries 
potential forward looking risks affecting profitability the results of operations of the company s businesses  particularly the businesses comprising its accumulation products segment and the businesses comprising its retail brokerage and investment banking segment  are highly sensitive to general economic and securities market conditions 
such conditions include the level of valuations in the securities markets  the level of interest rates  consumer sentiment  the level of retail securities trading volume  and the consensus economic and securities market outlook 
set forth below is a discussion of certain matters that may adversely impact the company s results of operations in the event of a continuation or worsening of current economic and securities market conditions  as well as other matters that could adversely affect its future earnings further declines in securities market prices could reduce the value of certain intangible assets on the company s balance sheet the company might have to amortize or write off deferred policy acquisition costs sooner than planned 
in accordance with gaap  deferred policy acquisition costs dpac policy acquisition costs represent costs that vary with and primarily relate to the production of business  such as commissions paid to financial professionals and brokers are amortized on a basis consistent with how earnings emerge from the underlying products that gave rise to such dpac 
such amortization is calculated based on the actual amount of earnings that have emerged to date relative to management s best estimate of the total amount of such earnings expected to emerge over the life of such business 
this calculation requires the company to make assumptions about future investment yields  contract charges  interest crediting rates  mortality rates  lapse rates  expense levels  policyholder dividends and policy duration 
in addition  to the extent that the present value of estimated future earnings expected to emerge over the remaining life of the business is not sufficient to recover the remaining dpac balance  gaap requires that such excess dpac amount be immediately charged to earnings 
accordingly  changes in the company s assumptions underlying dpac or actual results that differ significantly from management s prior estimates may materially affect the rate at which the company amortizes or writes off dpac  which may materially affect its financial position and results of operations 
also  to the extent that circumstances lead management to conclude that the business  after writing off all dpac  will not ultimately be profitable  the company would be required to record its best estimate of the loss in the period such determination was made 
while management believes such a scenario is unlikely  a sustained deterioration in the securities markets will significantly impact such determination and may require the company to recognize a loss that could materially affect its financial position and results of operations 
at december  the carrying value of our dpac was billion 
approximately million of this amount pertains to the company s annuity in force business 
the profit margins from this business  over which the related dpac is amortized  are particularly sensitive to changes in assumed investment returns and asset valuations 
with respect to the investment return assumptions which underlie the amortization of the company s annuity dpac  the accounting policy applied  which is referred to as the reversion to the mean method  assumes a rate of return over the life of the business of 
in applying this method  the future assumed rate of return assumption is adjusted based on actual returns to date so that the ultimate rate of return over the expected life of the business is always 
however  the company s policy is to never exceed a future rate of return assumption in excess of 
accordingly  the ultimate rate of return over the life of such business may be less than 
in addition  in applying the reversion to the mean method the company s policy does not provide for a floor on the assumed future rate of return 
accordingly  actual returns to date sufficiently in excess of the ultimate assumed rate of return of may result in a future rate of return assumption that could actually be negative 
while the company s current best estimate for the ultimate investment return underlying this business is  a continuing deterioration in the securities markets whether with regard to investment returns or asset valuations could require the company to revise it s estimate of the ultimate profitability of this business 
this could result in accelerated amortization and or a charge to earnings to reflect the amount of dpac which may not be recoverable from the estimated present value of future profits expected to emerge from this business 
such an event  should it occur  may materially affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
during  the company revised its estimate of the ultimate amount of gross profits to be earned from its annuity in force block of business 
this revision reflects the decline in annuity in force account values during the year due primarily to the deterioration of the equity securities markets 
as a result of this revised estimate  the company recorded a charge of 
table of contents million during to reflect the amount of dpac amortization that should have been recorded through december  based on the company s best estimate of the ultimate gross profits from the annuity in force business 
in addition  the company recorded a charge of million representing its best estimate of the amount of annuity in force dpac that is not recoverable based on the estimated present value of future gross profits expected to emerge from this business 
the company s calculation of annuity product dpac asset balances as of december  incorporates an assumption of returns in and later for all funds underlying variable annuity products 
this assumption is consistent with the reversion to the mean method described above 
the assumption of future returns impacts the company s expectation of both future fee income and future expenses  including the cost of the death benefit guarantees 
the company s anticipated earnings for  which were disclosed at its investment community meeting on january  were predicated on a return  which built in million of variable annuity dpac unlocking 
within a narrow range  any deviation from will change earnings by approximately million per change in return 
for example  a return of would lead to a million gain relative to plan  and a return of would lead to a million loss 
however  if returns fall substantially below or  the company may need to take additional loss recognition writeoffs 
these writeoffs have a larger immediate impact than dpac unlocking  in that the entire amount of dpac deemed non recoverable must be written off at once  rather than over the life of the product 
every additional drop of in this range would decrease earnings by approximately million 
for example  returns of would decrease pre tax earnings by approximately million 
the company might have to write off some goodwill 
the carrying value of goodwill in the company s retail brokerage and investment banking segment was million at december  based on the company s estimate of the fair value of these businesses  the company concluded that no impairment of such goodwill exists as on december  however  if securities market conditions worsen or if there is a prolonged downturn in retail securities trading volumes  the company might conclude  in the future  that all or a portion of such goodwill is impaired and must be written off 
the company may be required to recognize in its earnings other than temporary impairment charges on its investments in fixed maturity and equity securities  as well as mark to market losses on certain of its venture capital investments management s assessment of whether an investment in a debt or equity security is other than temporarily impaired is based primarily on the following factors management s analysis of the issuer s financial condition and trends therein  the value of any collateral or guaranty  the investment s position in the issuer s capital structure  management s analysis of industry fundamentals  management s assessment of the macro economic outlook  and the consideration of other factors  including any actions by rating agencies affecting the issuer  the period of time the fair value of a security has been at less than its cost  the company s expectations regarding the period of time required for a recovery of any current unrealized loss  and other relevant facts regarding the issuer 
changes in the factors discussed above particularly  a sustained or continuing decline in the prices of securities or a deterioration in the credit quality of issuers or a deterioration in industry or issuer fundamentals or in the macro economic outlook may significantly affect the company s determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired  which may require the company to recognize an other than temporary impairment charge that could be material to its financial position and results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments other than temporary impairment charges on investments in fixed maturity securities and common stocks 
the company makes investments in partnerships specializing in venture capital investing 
the company s investments are in the form of limited partnership interests 
the company generally limits these investments to no more than to of its total invested assets 
in accordance with gaap  certain of the company s investments in these partnerships are accounted for under the equity method of accounting  while the balance of the portfolio is accounted for at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income 
generally  substantially all the company s partnership investments acquired before may are accounted for at fair value  while those acquired after may are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
because the underlying partnerships are required under gaap to mark their investment portfolios to market and report changes in such market value through their earnings  the company s earnings will reflect the pro rata share of such mark to market adjustment if the company accounts for the partnership investment under the equity method 
with respect to partnerships accounted for at fair value  there will be no impact on the company s earnings until i the underlying investments held by the partnership are distributed to the company by the partnership  or ii the underlying investments held by the partnership are sold by the partnership and the proceeds distributed to the company  or iii an 
table of contents impairment of the company s investment in the partnership is determined to exist 
historically  venture capital investments have had a significant impact on the company s earnings 
the company s future earnings from venture capital investments could be adversely affected when market valuations deteriorate  which could materially affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
at december   the carrying value of the company s venture capital investments was million  of which million is accounted for under the equity method and million is accounted for at fair value 
further declines in securities market prices could increase the company s liabilities and expenses certain of the company s annuity products have contractual provisions which guarantee minimum death benefits 
these provisions require the company to pay the beneficiary any excess of the guaranteed minimum benefit over the fund value of the annuity contract in addition to the payment of the fund value 
it is the company s practice to establish reserves for the payment of any guaranteed minimum death benefit claims on the basis of its outlook for mortality experience and the amount at risk on the annuity contracts 
at december   the company s net amount at risk or the aggregate amount by which the guaranteed values exceeded the cash values of the company s in force annuity contracts totaled approximately million 
at december   the company carried a reserve of approximately million with respect to such claims 
however  additional reserves for such claims may need to be established  particularly if there is a sustained or continuing deterioration in the securities markets 
in addition  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa is deliberating the issuance of guidance concerning the establishment of such reserves 
this guidance may require the company to change its methodology for determining the amount of reserves that should be established for such claims 
accordingly  upon the adoption of any new guidance issued by the aicpa  the company might then have to establish additional reserves 
further declines in securities market prices could decrease our revenues as discussed above under the caption general discussion of factors affecting profitability  revenues from the company s separate account and mutual fund products depend  in large part  upon the amount of assets it has under management 
accordingly  a continuing or sustained deterioration in the securities markets can adversely affect the company s revenues which could be material to its results of operations and financial position 
continuing weakness in the securities markets could result in increased pension costs as required under gaap  both the rate of return assumption for on assets funding the company s pension liabilities and the discount rate used to determine those liabilities were established at the end of december  the company made these assumptions on the basis of historical returns on such assets  its outlook for future returns  the long term outlook for such returns in the marketplace  and yields available on high quality corporate bonds 
however  due to deteriorating economic conditions  the decline in securities market valuations and interest rates  the company lowered both its assumed rate of return assumption from to and the discount rate assumption from to  which will cause an increase in the company s net periodic pension expense in and thereafter 
in addition  the deterioration of the securities markets during has resulted in a decline in the fair value of the assets funding the company s pension obligations 
as a result  the company s net periodic pension expense will increase in and thereafter due to the requirement under gaap to amortize unrealized gains and losses through net periodic pension costs over a period of time 
the company expects that the effect of changing the assumed rate of return on assets funding the company s pension liabilities and the decline in the fair value of such assets  as well as changing the discount rate  will result in lower earnings in of approximately million before tax  as compared to those reported in in addition  a continuing deterioration in the securities markets may require further changes in the assumed rate of return on assets funding the company s pension liabilities and the discount rate  which may have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
while the market value of assets exceeded the company s pension liabilities at december   any unfunded liability at december  will either cause the company to contribute assets to the pension plan in an amount sufficient to eliminate any unfunded position or  as required by gaap  the company will be required to charge to comprehensive income the full amount of any prepaid benefit cost at such date 
at december   prepaid benefit costs aggregated million 
while management expects that  in the event of an underfunded position  it would make a contribution to the company s pension to avoid such a charge to comprehensive income  this will ultimately depend upon the total amount of any such underfunding  which largely is dependent upon the market values of assets backing the pension plan  and the amount of pension plan liabilities  at december  it should be noted that  in the event a company is required to charge its prepaid benefit cost asset to comprehensive income due to an underfunded position  in accordance with gaap  a company may reestablish that asset if the market value of assets supporting the pension plan increase  the plan liabilities decrease  and or subsequent contributions to the pension plan cause the plan be in a funded position 
the company s expenses may increase if it chooses or becomes required to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
and recognize expense for the issuance of certain employee stock based compensation presently there is a significant debate within industry  the accounting profession and among securities analysts and regulators as to the propriety of the current generally accepted accounting practice provided in accounting principles board opinion 
table of contents no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees opinion no 
 which provides for the application of the intrinsic value based method of accounting 
for certain stock based compensation plans including certain stock option plans  the guidance provided in opinion no 
does not require companies to recognize compensation expense 
recently  certain companies  in response to this debate  have announced their intention to adopt the generally accepted accounting guidance prescribed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which provides for the application of the fair value based method of accounting 
in accordance with this method  all forms of employee stock based compensation are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed over the requisite service or vesting period 
if the company chooses to adopt these provisions of sfas no 
or if it becomes required to adopt such provisions as a result of action by the financial accounting standards board  the adoption will result in additional expense recognition in an amount that may be material to the company s results of operations 
segments the company s business is organized in three principal reportable segments the protection products segment  the accumulation products segment  and the retail brokerage and investment banking segment 
substantially all of the company s other business activities are combined and reported in the other products segment 
certain amounts  which are not allocated to the segments  are reported as reconciling items 
reconciling items are principally comprised of i revenues and expenses associated with contracts issued by mony life relating to its employee benefit plans  ii revenues and expenses of the mony group  iii revenues and expenses of mony holdings  since its formation and commencement of operations in see note to the consolidated financial statements  and iv certain charges associated with the company s reorganization activities in and see reorganization and other charges for further details 
the company formed the retail brokerage and investment banking segment in in connection with its acquisitions of advest and matrix 
in addition to these companies  this segment includes the revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities of msc 
in prior years msc was reported in the company s other products segment 
accordingly  segment disclosures for years prior to have been restated to conform to the current period presentation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s reportable segments 
critical accounting policies preparation of the company s financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve significant use of judgment 
differences between estimated and actual results and changes in facts and circumstances that cause management to revise its estimates may materially affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
the following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies that  in the company s view  require significant use of judgment 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a complete description of the company s significant accounting policies 
investments the company records investments in fixed maturity securities and equity securities available for sale  trading account securities and certain investments in venture capital partnerships at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet 
in most cases  the company determines fair values using quoted market prices 
however  the valuation of certain investments  such as private placement fixed maturity securities  requires the use of assumptions and estimates related to interest rates  default rates  and the timing of cash flows because quoted market prices are not available 
at december   the carrying value of private placement fixed maturity securities was  million 
the company records changes in the fair values of investments in fixed maturity securities and equity securities available for sale that are not considered to be other than temporarily impaired in other comprehensive income 
the company reports changes in the value of venture capital investments accounted for using the equity method and trading securities in the consolidated statement of operations 
for investments the company considers to be other than temporarily impaired  the company records an impairment loss  which is reflected in realized gains losses on investments see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments other than temporary impairment charges on investments in fixed maturity securities and common stocks 
determining whether a security is other than temporarily impaired requires the use of estimates and significant judgment 
the company s financial position and results of operations are therefore affected by changes in circumstances that affect the value of these investments and the company s determination as to whether the investments are other than temporarily impaired 
the company records mortgage loans on real estate at their unpaid principal balances  net of valuation allowances 
valuation allowances are established for the excess of the carrying value of a mortgage loan over its estimated fair value when the loan is considered to be impaired 
mortgage loans are considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
estimated fair value is based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  or the loan s observable market price if considered to be a practical expedient  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent and if foreclosure of the loan is considered probable 
in addition  the company records an estimate for incurred but not reported defaults 
the company bases its estimate for incurred but not reported defaults on historical default rates and the current mortgage portfolio composition 
the company s financial position and operating results are therefore sensitive to i changes in the estimated cash flows from mortgages  ii the value of the collateral  and iii changes in the economic environment in general 
at december  and  the valuation allowance on these mortgage loans was million and million  respectively 

table of contents deferred policy acquisition costs and insurance reserves the company values dpac and insurance reserves in accordance with the relevant gaap pronouncements generally statement of financial accounting standard sfas for term and whole life insurance products  sfas for universal life and investment type contracts  and sfas for traditional participating life insurance contracts 
the valuation of dpac and insurance reserves requires management to assume future investment yields  mortality rates  lapse rates  expense levels  policyholder dividends and policy duration 
for many of the company s products  amortization of dpac varies with profit margins of the policies and contracts supporting the dpac balances 
the company must periodically evaluate the recoverability of dpac and the adequacy of its reserves based on historical and projected future results 
changes in management s assumptions or actual results that differ significantly from management s estimates may materially affect the company s financial position and results of operations see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations potential forward looking risks affecting profitability 
goodwill and intangible assets the company s assets include goodwill and intangible assets  which are primarily related to its acquisition of advest 
in accordance with sfas  the company must reevaluate the valuation of the goodwill and intangible assets at least annually by comparing the fair value and carrying value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill and intangible assets relate 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company must recognize an impairment loss for the excess of carrying value over fair value 
the estimate of a reporting unit s fair value considers various valuation methodologies and in certain cases  requires the use of assumptions and estimates regarding the reporting unit s future cash flows and discount rates 
changes in the business supporting the goodwill and intangible assets may affect management s assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations potential forward looking risks affecting profitability 
litigation  contingencies and restructuring charges accounting for litigation  contingencies and restructuring charges requires the company to estimate the expected costs of events which have already occurred but which the company has not completely resolved 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is party to various legal actions and proceedings in connection with its businesses 
to the extent the losses are probable and reasonably estimable  the company records liabilities related to these matters in accordance with the provisions of sfas and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation judgments or settlements exceeding established loss reserves or changes in the circumstances requiring management to update its loss estimate may materially affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in both and the company established reserves related to the reorganization of certain of its businesses 
these reserves are primarily related to the estimated costs of employee terminations and benefits  lease abandonments and other costs directly related to the company s reorganization plans and incremental to the company s normal operating costs 
although management does not expect significant changes to its reorganization plans  the actual costs related to these plans may differ from management s estimates 
other significant estimates in addition to the items discussed above  the application of gaap requires management to make other estimates and assumptions 
for example  accounting for pension and other post retirement and post employment benefits requires estimates of future returns on plan assets  expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations potential forward looking risks affecting profitability 
also see note to the consolidated financial statements 
another example is the recognition of deferred tax assets  which depends upon management s assumptions with respect to the company s ability to realize the deferred tax benefit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements

the restructure charge consisted of severance and related benefits of million resulting from headcount reductions of and in the company s home office and career agency system  respectively  and million of other miscellaneous items 
the balance of the charge in  million  was unrelated to the company s restructure activities and consisted of i impairments of certain invested assets and valuation related write downs of private equity securities held in the company s equity method venture capital portfolio  ii the write off of deferred sales charges in the company s mutual fund business to reflect revised estimates of recoverability which are principally due to the decline in the value of the company s internet funds  iii write downs of certain information technology assets  and iv other miscellaneous items

for the year ended december  in millions protection products segment single premiums new premiums renewal premiums premiums ceded total premiums  excluding usfl and other usfl other total protection products segment premium revenue in the protection products segment  excluding usfl  decreased million  primarily due to a reduction in single and renewal premiums on individual life of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in premiums is primarily attributable to a reduction of the in force block 
usfl s premiums were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in usfl s premiums is primarily due to higher new premiums on special risk insurance products attributable to the increased penetration of the broker market into more states and an increase in renewal premiums 
the increase premiums in the accumulation products segment from million to million was primarily due to an increase in life contingent immediate annuity sales while the increase in the other products segment from million to million was primarily attributable to an increase in assumed premiums from the us servicemen s group life insurance pool segli 
universal life and investment type product policy fees universal life and investment type product policy fees were million for  a decrease of million  or  from million reported for the decrease was primarily a result of lower fees in the accumulation products segment of million  partially offset by higher fees in the protection products and other products segments of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the accumulation products segment is primarily due to lower flexible premium variable annuity fpva mortality and expense charges of million due to lower separate account fund balances

no other individual non government issuer represents more than of invested assets 
the company held approximately  million and  million of mortgage backed and asset backed securities as of december  and  respectively 
of such amounts  million and million or and  respectively  represented agency issued pass through and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos secured by the federal national mortgage association  federal home loan mortgage corporation  government national mortgage association and canadian housing authority collateral 
the balance of such amounts was comprised of other types of mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the company believes that its active monitoring of its portfolio of mortgage backed securities and the limited extent of its holdings of more volatile types of mortgage backed securities mitigate the company s exposure to losses from prepayment risk associated with interest rate fluctuations for this portfolio 
at december  and   and  respectively  of the company s mortgage backed and asset backed securities were assigned an naic designation 
table of contents the following table presents the types of mortgage backed securities mbss  as well as other asset backed securities  held by the company as of the dates indicated 
mortgage and asset backed securities as of december  in millions cmos pass through securities commercial mbss asset backed securities total mbss and asset backed securities cmos are purchased to diversify the portfolio risk characteristics from primarily corporate credit risk to a mix of credit and cash flow risk 
the majority of the cmos in the company s investment portfolio have relatively low cash flow variability 
in addition  approximately of the cmos in the portfolio have low credit risk because the underlying collateral is backed by the federal national mortgage association  the federal home loan mortgage corporation  or the government national mortgage association 
these cmos offer greater liquidity and higher yields than corporate debt securities of similar credit quality and expected average lives 
the principal risks inherent in holding cmos as well as pass through securities are prepayment and extension risks arising from changes in market interest rates 
in declining interest rate environments  the mortgages underlying the cmos are prepaid more rapidly than anticipated  causing early repayment of the cmos 
in rising interest rate environments  the underlying mortgages are prepaid at a slower rate than anticipated  causing cmo principal repayments to be extended 
although early cmo repayments may result in acceleration of income from recognition of any unamortized discount  the proceeds typically are reinvested at lower current yields  resulting in a net reduction of future investment income 
the company manages this prepayment and extension risk by investing in cmo tranches that provide for greater stability of cash flows 
the following table presents the mix of cmo tranches as of the dates indicated 
collateralized mortgage obligations by tranche as of december  in millions planned amortization class sequential target amortization class other total cmos the planned amortization class pac tranche is structured to provide more certain cash flows to the investor and therefore is subject to less prepayment and extension risk than other cmo tranches 
in general  the company s pacs are structured to provide average life stability for increases and decreases in interest rates of to basis points 
pacs derive their stability from two factors i early repayments are applied first to other tranches to preserve the pacs originally scheduled cash flows as much as possible and ii cash flows applicable to other tranches are applied first to the pac if the pacs actual cash flows are received later than originally anticipated 
the prepayment and extension risk associated with a sequential tranche can vary as interest rates fluctuate  since this tranche is not supported by other tranches 
the target amortization class tranche has protection similar to pacs in decreasing interest rate environments  but has minimal protection in increasing rate environments 
the majority of the securities contained in the company s cmo portfolio are traded in the open market 
as such  the company obtains market prices from outside vendors 
any security price not received from such vendors is obtained from the originating broker or internally calculated 
asset backed securities abs are purchased both to diversify the overall credit risks of the fixed maturity security portfolio and to provide attractive returns 
the abs portfolio is diversified both by type of asset and by issuer 
the largest asset class exposure in the abs portfolio is to credit card receivables  representing and of the total at december  and  respectively 
these are comprised of pools of both general purpose credit card receivables such as visa and mastercard and private label credit card receivable pools 
other significant asset class exposures in the abs portfolio as of december  and included public utilities rate reduction receivables and  respectively and manufactured housing receivables

mortgage loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when the company determines that a loan is impaired  a valuation allowance for loss is established for the excess of the carrying value of the mortgage loan over its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is based on the fair value of the collateral 
the provision for loss is reported as a realized loss on investment 

table of contents the company reviews its mortgage loan portfolio and analyzes the need for a valuation allowance for any loan which is delinquent for days or more  in process of foreclosure  restructured  on watchlist  or which currently has a valuation allowance

other than temporary impairment charges on investments in fixed maturity securities and common stocks management s assessment of whether an investment by the company in a debt or equity security is other than temporarily impaired is primarily based on the following factors management s analysis of the issuer s financial condition and trends therein  the value of any collateral or guaranty  the investment s position in the issuer s capital structure  management s analysis of industry fundamentals  management s assessment of the macro economic outlook  and the consideration of other factors  including any actions by rating agencies affecting the issuer  the period of time the fair value of a security has been at less than its cost  management s expectations regarding the period of time required for a recovery of any current unrealized loss  and other relevant facts regarding the issuer 
the company s accounting policy provides that the company  at the end of each reporting period  review all securities where the fair value thereof has declined below of its current cost basis to determine whether such securities are other than temporarily impaired 
in addition  pursuant to this policy  management reviews securities that have experienced lesser percentage declines in value on a more selective basis using many of the previously discussed factors that the company considers in making a determination that a security is other than temporarily impaired 
once management determines that a security is other than temporarily impaired the impairment charge is measured based on the difference between the carrying value of the security and its fair value at the date the determination of impairment is made 
the following table presents certain information with respect to realized investment losses from other than temporary impairment charges for the years ended december  and these impairment charges were determined based on the company s assessment of the factors referred to above  as they pertain to the individual securities determined to be other than temporarily impaired

the company s portfolio of common stocks is comprised of all public securities 
public securities are those that are registered with the securities and exchange commission sec 
private securities are issued under an exemption from registration under the securities act of it is generally recognized that publicly traded securities are more liquid than privately traded securities 
the company classifies all of its investments in fixed maturity securities and common stocks as available for sale 
accordingly  the carrying value of such securities reflects their fair value at the balance sheet date 
fair value for public securities is based on sales prices or bid and asked quotations currently available on a securities exchange registered with the commission or in the over the counter market  provided that those prices or quotations for the over the counter market are publicly reported by the national association of securities dealers automated quotations system nasdaq 
fair value for private securities is generally determined by discounting their prospective cash flows at a discount rate 
the discount rate for each issue is the sum of two rates 
the first component is the yield to maturity of a us treasury security with a maturity comparable to the average life of the issue being priced 
the second component is a credit spread assigned from a matrix based on credit rating and average life 
this matrix is created monthly based on data from two major broker dealers 
the quality ratings on the issues being priced are reviewed and updated quarterly

in determining that the securities giving rise to the aforementioned unrealized losses were not other than temporarily impaired  the company evaluated the factors cited above  which it considers when assessing whether a security is other than temporarily impaired 
in making these evaluations  the company must exercise considerable judgment 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from the company s judgments and that such differences may require the future recognition of other than temporary impairment charges that could have a material affect on its financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the value of  and the realization of any loss on  a fixed maturity security or common stock is subject to numerous risks  including interest rate risk  market risk  credit risk and liquidity risk 
the magnitude of any loss incurred by the company may be affected by the relative concentration of its investments in any one issuer or industry

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk set forth below is a discussion regarding the company s market risk  excluding advest  and how it is managed 
following this discussion is a separate discussion regarding advest s market risk and how it is managed 
company market risk excluding advest the company s results of operations significantly depend on profit margins between general account invested assets and interest credited on insurance and annuity products 
changes in interest rates can potentially impact the company s profitability 
management believes the company s liabilities should be supported by a portfolio principally composed of fixed rate investments that can generate predictable  steady rates of return 
although these assets are purchased for long term investment  the portfolio management strategy considers them available for sale in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in prepayment risk  changes in relative values of asset sectors and individual securities and loans  changes in credit quality outlook and other relevant factors 
the objective of portfolio management is to maximize returns  taking into consideration the aforementioned factors 
the company s asset liability management discipline includes strategies to minimize exposure to loss as interest rates and economic and market conditions change 
as a result  the company s fixed maturity portfolio has modest exposure to call and prepayment risk and the vast majority of mortgage loan investments are fixed rate mortgages that carry yield maintenance and prepayment provisions 

table of contents interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to its investments in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans outside the closed block  and in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans included in the assets transferred in the group pension transaction which ceased as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of the closed block see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the risk with respect to assets transferred in the group pension transaction is limited 
see policyholder liability characteristics 
the carrying value of investments in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans outside the closed block represent  at december   of the aggregate carrying value of the company s consolidated invested assets outside the closed block excluding the debt service coverage account sub account ob and sub account cbb 
substantially all of the company s fixed maturity securities are us dollar denominated securities 
as part of its asset liability management discipline  quantitative analyses are conducted that model the assets with interest rate risk assuming various changes in interest rates 
the table below shows the company s potential exposure  measured in terms of fair value  to an immediate basis point increase in interest rates from levels prevailing at december  a basis point fluctuation in interest rates is a hypothetical interest rate scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent management s view of future market changes 
while these fair value measurements provide a representation of interest rate sensitivity of the company s portfolio of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans  they are based on the company s portfolio exposures at a particular point in time and may not be representative of future market results 
these exposures will change as a result of ongoing portfolio activities in response to management s assessment of changing market conditions and available investment opportunities 
the table below shows the potential fair value exposure of assets to an immediate basis point change in interest rates from those prevailing at december  and change in fair value at december  basis point change at december  basis point change in millions assets with interest rate risk fair value fixed maturity securities mortgage loans total assets transferred in the group pension transaction fixed maturity securities mortgage loans total total fixed income securities fixed maturity securities mortgage loans total the group pension transaction ceased as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to its interest rate risk relating to fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans  the company has interest rate exposure relating to its issuance of long term debt obligations 
the table below shows the potential fair value exposure of long term debt with interest rate risk to an immediate basis point change in interest rates from those prevailing at december  and long term debt with interest rate risk fair value at december  basis point change at december  basis point change in millions fixed rate debt equity price risk the company s investment portfolio contains investments in equity securities  which are comprised of investments in common stocks and limited partnership interests of investment partnerships 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments equity securities 
the aforementioned investment partnerships principally invest in technology companies and other types of investments whose market prices have experienced significant 
table of contents volatility 
a decrease in equity prices is a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent management s view of future market changes  nor does it reflect the volatility that has been experienced by some of the sectors in which the company has common stock investments 
in addition  the fair value measurements shown are based on the equity securities portfolio exposures at a particular point in time and these exposures will change as a result of ongoing portfolio activities in response to management s assessment of changing market conditions and available investment opportunities 
also  since a significant portion of the company s investments in limited partnerships are accounted for under the equity method  changes in the value of such partnership investments will directly affect the earnings reported by the company 
the table below shows the potential fair value exposure of assets with equity price risk to an immediate  drop in equity prices from those prevailing at december  and assets with equity price risk fair value at december  basis point change at december  basis point change in millions equity securities policyholders liability characteristics due to the manner in which the closed block was funded and the ability of management to adjust dividends paid on closed block policies  as more fully explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  management believes that the company s exposure to market risk with respect to liabilities and assets allocated to the closed block is minimal 
policyholders liabilities outside the closed block at december  consisted of future policy benefits  policyholders account balances  and other policyholder liabilities of  million   million  and million  respectively 
these liabilities were backed  at such date  by approximately billion of assets which represented all general account assets of the insurance subsidiaries of the mony group  including invested assets of approximately billion 
ensuring that the expected cash flows generated by the assets are sufficient  given the policyholder obligations  is an explicit objective of the company s asset liability management strategy 
following is a discussion of the company s policyholders policy and annuity liabilities at december  future policy benefits 
products in the future policy benefits category contain significant actuarial including mortality and morbidity pricing and cash flow risks 
the cash flows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing and amount of benefit payments 
the primary risks associated with these products are that the benefits will exceed expected actuarial pricing and or that the actual timing of the cash flows will differ from those anticipated  resulting in an investment return lower than that assumed in pricing 
products comprising this category include single premium whole life  yearly renewable term  level term policies  group pensions  group life and health insurance  supplementary contracts with life contingencies  and immediate annuities 
future policy benefit liabilities on such business outside the closed block aggregated approximately billion at december  the guaranteed rate on single premium whole life business  which represents policyholder liabilities of approximately billion at december   is 
also included in this category are disability income future policy benefit liabilities of approximately billion at december  all such business was reinsured effective december  policyholders account balances and other policyholders liabilities 
products in the policyholders account balances and other policyholders liabilities categories credit interest to policyholders  subject to market conditions and minimum guarantees 
interest crediting on the products in this category may be reset periodically 
policyholders may surrender at book value  but under the terms of certain of the products in this category they may be subject to surrender charges for an initial period 
product examples include single premium deferred annuities  universal life contracts  and the general account portion of the company s variable annuity products 
in general  the company s investment strategy is designed to manage a portfolio of assets with appropriate duration and convexity consistent with the characteristics and risk elements of the products comprising the policyholders account balances liabilities 
liability durations are short to intermediate term for annuities and intermediate term for life insurance products 
asset and liability management techniques asset and liability management is integrated into many aspects of the company s operations  including investment decisions  product development and determination of interest crediting rates 
as part of the risk management process  numerous scenarios are modeled  including cash flow testing required for insurance regulatory purposes  to determine if existing assets would be sufficient to meet projected liability cash flows 
key variables include policy terms and policyholder behavior  such as persistency  under differing crediting rate strategies 
on the basis of these analyses  management believes there is no material solvency risk to the company with respect to interest rate movements up or down basis points from rate levels at december  or with respect to a percent drop in equity prices from december  
table of contents advest market risk risk management advest s risk management strategies include the use of derivatives  principally exchange traded futures contracts 
its risk management activities also include inventory and hedging policies 
inventory policies reflect the level of aggregate short and long positions that may be held for trading and are specified by product line 
during its normal course of business  advest engages in the trading of securities  primarily fixed income  in both a proprietary and market making capacity  and holds securities for trading  rather than investment  purposes 
advest makes a market in certain investment grade corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities  municipal bonds and over the counter equities in order to facilitate order flow and accommodate its retail and institutional customers 
market risk market risk represents the potential change in the value of financial instruments due to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  equity and commodity prices 
in the course of its trading and hedging activities  advest is exposed to interest rate and equity price risk 
advest is exposed to market risk arising from changes in interest rates 
advest s management seeks to reduce the risk of its trading portfolio on an aggregate basis 
advest s management activities include inventory policies that reflect the level of aggregate short and long positions that may be held for trading and are specified by product line 
risk management strategies also include the use of derivatives  principally exchange traded futures contracts 
equity price risk advest is exposed to equity price risk as a result of making a market in over the counter equity securities 
equity price risk arises from changes in the price and volatility of equity securities 
in april  a comprehensive review of advest s nasdaq trading activities was completed and the decision was made to reduce overnight inventory and more aggressively manage the number of stocks in which it made a market 
trading accounts value at risk analysis for purposes of the commission s market risk disclosure requirements  advest has performed a value at risk analysis of its trading financial instruments and derivatives 
the value at risk calculation uses standard statistical techniques to measure the potential loss in fair value based upon a one day holding period and a confidence level 
even though these filings are annual  total firm  institutional plus retail position computations are performed monthly in order to achieve a better understanding of advest s risk return profile
