critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to the accuracy of the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and investments 
revenue recognition the company derives revenue from advertising services  including media buying  and from marketing and communication services  including market research  public relations  direct marketing  sales promotion and event marketing activities 
the company s advertising services revenue is derived from commissions that are earned when the media is placed  from fees earned as advertising services are performed and from production services rendered 
in addition  incentive amounts may be earned based on qualitative and or quantitative criteria 
in the case of commissions  revenue is recognized as the media placements appear 
in the case of fee and production arrangements  the revenue is recognized as the services are performed which is generally ratably over the period of the client contract 
the company s marketing service revenues are generally earned on a fee basis  and in certain cases incentive amounts may also be earned 
as with fee arrangements in advertising  such revenue is recognized as the work is performed 
incentive amounts for advertising and marketing services are recognized upon satisfaction of the qualitative and or quantitative criteria  as set out in the relevant client contract 
the interpublic group of companies  inc 
and its subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share amounts in many cases  the amount the company bills to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenues that is earned due to the existence of various pass through charges such as the cost of media 
in compliance with eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  the company generally records revenue net of pass through charges as it is not the primary obligor with respect to the cost of pass through charges 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company assesses the required amount of allowance for doubtful accounts based on past experience and reviews of aging and analysis of specific accounts 
while the expense for bad debts has historically fluctuated in line with revenue  in the company recorded a higher amount of bad debt expense reflective of general economic conditions 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes payable in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it is determined that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the amount of valuation allowance that would be required 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establis h an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact the company s financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and investments the company has a significant amount of long lived assets  including fixed assets  investments  goodwill and other intangibles 
the company periodically evaluates the realizability of all of its long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with a given operation have become impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
other matters argentina and brazil as a result of the devaluation of the currencies in argentina and brazil  the company s cumulative translation adjustment balance reflected a reduction in stockholders equity of approximately at december  the company expects to maintain its strategic investment in argentina and brazil for the long term 
recent accounting standards standards adopted effective january  property and equipment property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
when such events or circumstances arise  an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows produced by the asset  or the appropriate grouping of assets  is compared to the asset s carrying value to determine if an impairment exists pursuant to the requirements of sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
if the asset is determined to be impaired  the impairment loss is measured based on the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of its carrying value or net realizable value 
effective january   the company adopted sfas the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the interpublic group of companies  inc 
and its subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share amounts intangible assets goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
effective january   with the adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized 
prior to january   goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis  over periods not exceeding years 
beginning january   goodwill is tested for impairment annually  and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level 
reporting units are one level below the business segment level  but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics 
the vast majority of goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit 
an impairment loss would generally be recognized when the car rying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the company completed its assessment of any potential impairment upon adoption of this standard and upon its annual assessment the company determined that  other than the impairment charges discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  no impairments existed 
prior to january   goodwill was tested for impairment in a manner consistent with the method used to test property and equipment and intangible assets with a definite life 
during the first quarter of  the company performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and determined that there was no impairment required to be recognized upon adoption 
the following analysis shows the impact on the company s statement of operations of discontinuing goodwill amortization had sfas been effective for all periods presented year ended december  reported net income loss add back goodwill amortization tax benefit on goodwill amortization adjusted net income loss basic earnings loss per share reported earnings loss add back goodwill amortization  net of tax adjusted earnings loss diluted earnings loss per share reported earnings loss add back goodwill amortization  net of tax adjusted earnings loss other intangible assets include  principally  customer lists  trade names  customer relationships and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party 
effective january   with the adoption of sfas  intangible assets with an indefinite life  namely certain trade names  are not amortized 
intangible assets with a definite life are amortized on a straight line basis with estimated useful lives generally ranging from to years 
indefinite lived intangible assets will be tested for impairment annually  and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 
intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair val ue of the asset 
the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value 
fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
as of december   the company s remaining unamortized goodwill balance and intangible assets were  and  respectively 
the company estimates that  based on its current intangible assets  amortization expense will be approximately in each of the next five years

the company has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas standards to be adopted in june  sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas was issued 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs that result from the acquisition  construction  or development and normal operation of a long lived asset 
upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation  sfas requires an increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the asset s useful life 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas was issued

the interpublic group of companies  inc 
and its subsidiaries dollars in millions  except per share amounts item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to interest rates and foreign currencies 
interest rates at december   a significant portion of the company s debt obligations were at fixed interest rates 
accordingly  assuming the fixed rate debt is not refinanced  there would be no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a increase or decrease in market rates of interest 
the fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by if market rates were to increase by and would increase by if market rates were to decrease by 
for that portion of the debt that is either maintained at variable rates  based on amounts and rates outstanding at december   the change in interest expense and cash flow from a change in rates would be approximately foreign currencies the company faces two risks related to foreign currency exchange translation risk and transaction risk 
amounts invested in the company s foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
the company s foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the us dollar 
since the functional currency of the company s foreign operations is generally the local currency  foreign currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a component of stockholders equity and does not impact operating results 
revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into varying amounts of us dollars depending upon whether the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
therefore  changes in exchange rates may negatively affect the compa ny s consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations 
currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations and were not significant in  and the company has not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
