item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the financial statements  including the related notes  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
see forward looking statements 
overview our business is organized into three segments timber  paper and paperboard  and converted products 
we benefit from significant integration between our business segments 
during fiscal year  our paper and paperboard segment obtained approximately of its wood chips from logs that were harvested from our timberlands and chipped by our chipping operations 
in the same period  our converted products segment obtained approximately of its paper and paperboard requirements from our longview mill  representing approximately of total mill production 
in addition  our business segments share centralized corporate management  accounting  human resources and information systems support 
our fiscal year ends on october net sales for individual segments are reported net of intercompany transfers 
segment operating profits reflect allocations of selling  general and administrative expenses on the basis of the relative cost to produce products in each segment 
in the case of intercompany transfers of products between segments  cost of products sold is based upon transfer pricing policies that we believe assist us in managing and optimizing the consolidated financial performance of our business as a whole 
for example  paperboard acquired from our paper mill and used in our converting operations is assigned a transfer price equal to the paper mill s cost 
depending on market conditions  our transfer pricing practices may understate or overstate the actual price at which we could have sold those products into the open market or the actual price in the open market at which we could have purchased the raw materials used to produce those products 
as a consequence  these allocations and transfer pricing policies sometimes result in individual segment results that do not reflect the financial performance that would have resulted for a segment operating as a stand alone business 
our timber segment owns and operates timberlands in oregon and washington and produces logs for sale in the domestic and export markets 
during fiscal year  our domestic customers consisted of approximately independent sawmills and plywood plants 
results of operations for our timber segment also include our sawmill 
net sales of our timber segment are primarily affected by housing starts and other construction activity in the domestic and japanese markets 
construction activity is influenced by mortgage interest rates and general economic conditions in those markets 
net sales in this segment are also affected by supply side factors such as government regulation restricting the harvest of timber from public and certain private lands and competition from logs supplied by foreign producers  especially canadian producers 
the strength of the japanese export market can significantly influence the results of our timber segment since our sales into that market tend to be at higher prices than sales into the domestic market 
because all of our sales are us dollar denominated  our export sales are also significantly influenced by the relative strength of the us dollar 
cost of products sold in the timber segment primarily include contract logging expense  the cost of operating our sawmill  and depletion  which is based on the historical cost of timber that is harvested 
our paper and paperboard segment produces a wide variety of paper and paperboard at our longview mill 
we sell our paper and paperboard products to a number of domestic and export customers 
in fiscal year  our converted products segment used approximately of our paper and paperboard output 
net sales in the paper and paperboard segment are primarily affected by general economic activity in the united states and southeast asia and the relative strength of the us dollar 
average prices in this segment have also been favorably affected by industry capacity rationalization over the page last several years 
the demand for certain specialty products manufactured by our paper and paperboard segment tends to be less dependent on the economic cycles affecting the commodity paper market 
the major component of cost of products sold for the paper and paperboard segment is fiber  which consists primarily of wood chips  but also includes sawdust and recycled materials 
we have invested in processes that allow us to use an increased amount of less expensive sawdust and recycled materials in making our paper and paperboard products 
cost of products sold also includes labor  energy and chemicals used in processing 
our converted products segment produces corrugated containers  solid fiber boxes  creative point of purchase displays  handle shopping bags and merchandise bags 
nearly all of our converted products are sold domestically for end uses that include packaging for consumables such as fresh and frozen produce and beverages  as well as for toys  furniture and electronics 
net sales in the converted products segment are primarily affected by general economic activity in the united states 
the primary constituent materials for converted products are paper and paperboard 
our converted products segment obtained approximately of its paper and paperboard requirements from our longview mill 
cost of products sold also includes energy  labor  ink and glue 
our longview mill contains six steam driven generators and one natural gas fired co generation facility  all of which are capable of producing electrical power 
during fiscal year  we elected  based on the relationship between rates we could obtain for third party sales of electricity and the cost to us of purchasing electricity and natural gas  to sell a significant percentage of the electricity that we generated into the market 
as a result  we realized million from net sales of electrical power during that period and allocated the operating profit from those sales to the paper and paperboard and converted products segments based on the relative cost to produce products in each segment 
the primary contracts pursuant to which we purchased and sold power in fiscal year expired and  under new terms  we have significantly less flexibility in selling and using power generated by our facilities 
however  during the first fiscal quarter of  we elected to sell electrical power 
due to poor margins  we discontinued the sale of electrical power in january we also sold a minor amount of electrical power in the fourth quarter of fiscal year electrical power sales for fiscal year were million producing an operating loss of million 
we allocated the operating loss to our manufacturing segments with a loss of million to the paper and paperboard segment and a loss of million to our converted products segment 
operating profit from the sale of power totaled million for fiscal year  of which million was allocated to the paper and paperboard segment and million was allocated to the converted products segment 
our future decisions concerning electrical power generation  including the extent to which we operate our co generation facility for sales into the market  will change from period to period based on market conditions 
we do not expect sales of power to meaningfully contribute to our results in the coming year 
we can curtail the operation of certain of our equipment and facilities from time to time to provide us with flexibility in managing our operations and cost structure 
in order to meet market conditions and to maximize the efficient use of our paper machines  we curtailed three of our twelve paper machines for substantially all of fiscal year and for part of fiscal year in addition  we may curtail the operation of certain of our converting facilities if we believe it is advantageous to do so 
impairment is reviewed annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recovered 
impairment evaluates whether or not the undiscounted future cash flows generated by an asset will exceed its carrying value 
if estimated future cash flows indicate the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable  impairment exists  and the asset s book value is written down to its estimated realizable value

fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated results net sales 
fiscal year net sales were million compared with million for fiscal year net sales decreased as a result of a million decrease in net sales of internally generated power to third parties  a decrease in net sales in our paper and paperboard segment of million  or  and in our converted products segment of million  or  offset in part by an increase in net sales in our timber segment of million  or 
see selected segment results below 
cost of products sold 
fiscal year cost of products sold was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales for fiscal year this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of a increase in natural gas costs per unit  a increase in cost of electrical power purchased from third parties per unit  a increase in old corrugated containers occ costs and losses on third party power sales 
these cost increases were partially offset by an approximate decrease in average wood chip costs 
our cost of products sold also includes depreciation  depletion and amortization costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization consist primarily of depreciation of our plant and equipment  the depletion cost of timber harvested and  to a lesser degree  amortization of logging roads 
this expense was million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in net sales  costs associated with our business process improvement plan and increased health and welfare costs

selected segment results timber fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease timber net sales  millions timber operating profit  millions logs  thousands of board feet   lumber  thousands of board feet   logs  thousand board feet lumber  thousand board feet fiscal year timber net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to an increase in log volume sold and improved lumber prices  partially offset by a decrease in log prices of and a decrease in lumber volume of 
due to the relatively strong demand in the domestic log market  the company was able to temporarily increase harvest levels to improve operating results and cash flow 
the overall log price decline was in part due to a soft japanese housing market and adverse us dollar to japanese yen exchange rates 
however  as a consequence of midyear improvement in the exchange rate  export prices improved modestly in the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year export sales in the timber segment were million  or  of timber net sales compared with million  or  for fiscal year this decline was a result of decreases in export log prices and less lumber sold in the export market 
fiscal year timber operating profit was million  compared with million for fiscal year the primary reason for this improvement was an increase in log volume sold  partially offset by a decrease in average log prices 
paper and paperboard fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease paper and paperboard net sales  millions paper and paperboard operating profit  millions paper  tons   paperboard  tons   paper  ton fob mill equivalent paperboard  ton fob mill equivalent page fiscal year paper and paperboard net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal this decrease is primarily due to a and decrease in paperboard volume and price and a and decrease in paper volume and price  respectively 
paperboard volume decreased primarily as a result of our decision not to sell into the asian market at prices that were depressed 
paperboard prices were negatively affected by increased competition in the export market and the strength of the us dollar 
paper volume and prices decreased primarily as a result of the general economic slowdown in the us market 
however  the weaker us dollar in the second half of decreased imports of kraft paper to the united states and increased export pricing and demand 
combined with machine shutdowns and consolidation of converters  both demand and product pricing for most grades improved in the fourth quarter  both domestically and for our export sales 
demand and pricing has especially improved in the fourth quarter for light weight kraft paper with high occ content and tea kraft semi extensible paper for use in multiwall bags 
fiscal year export sales in the paper and paperboard segment were million  or of paper and paperboard net sales  compared with million  or  for fiscal year fiscal year paper and paperboard operating loss was million  compared with an operating profit of million for fiscal year operating results were negatively affected by losses from the sale of electrical power allocated to the paper and paperboard segment 
we allocated losses of million to the segment as a result of power sales in fiscal year  compared with allocated operating profits of million in fiscal year operating results were also negatively affected by a increase in the cost of electrical power per unit  increase in natural gas costs per unit  a increase in the cost of occ and lower sales prices 
as a result of operating losses incurred early in the year  the mill operating schedule and crew levels were changed to run and staff nine of our twelve paper machines creating a more steady operation and allowing us to better manage raw material purchases 
due to the new schedule and the availability of lower cost residual wood chips  we used a lower proportion of more expensive chips produced from whole log chipping operations 
operating results were favorably impacted by an reduction in average wood chip costs and improved labor productivity 
the mill operated at of capacity during fiscal year compared with during fiscal year converted products fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease converted products sales  millions converted products operating profit  millions converted products  tons   converted products  ton fiscal year converted products net sales were million compared with million for fiscal year converted products volume decreased and average price decreased 
this deterioration was primarily the result of the general slowdown in the domestic economy 
fiscal year converted products operating loss was million  compared with an operating profit of million for fiscal year operating results were negatively affected primarily by allocated operating losses from the sale of electrical power of million for fiscal year  compared with allocated operating profits of million in fiscal year operating results were also negatively affected by volume and price declines and the increased cost of paper and paperboard supplied to us by the longview mill 
the average mill cost of paper and paperboard supplied to our converting plants increased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year labor productivity improved for the year resulting from changing our operating schedules and crew levels to match customer demand 
substantial progress has been made in reducing rollstock and finished goods inventories and controllable waste 
page fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated results net sales 
fiscal year net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year net sales remained relatively unchanged as a result of an incremental million of opportunistic net sales of internally generated power to third parties on economically favorable terms  offset by a decrease in net sales in our paper and paperboard segments of million  or  and in our converted products segment of million  or 
see selected segment results below 
cost of products sold 
fiscal year cost of products sold was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a increase in average wood chip costs and a increase in average natural gas costs at the longview mill  which were partially due to increased power sales discussed above 
these were partially offset by an approximately decrease in average occ costs and high margins on power sales 
our cost of products sold includes depreciation  depletion and amortization costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization consist primarily of depreciation of our plant and equipment  the cost of timber harvested and  to a lesser degree  amortization of logging roads 
this expense was million for fiscal year  compared with million for fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal year this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to salary increases including market adjustments  the opening of our new bowling green  kentucky converting plant and costs associated with our business process improvement plan

the price decline was in part due to a soft japanese housing market and adverse us dollar to japanese yen exchange rates 
weak export market prices significantly influence our average prices as export prices tend to be significantly higher than domestic prices 
the volume increases were largely due to relatively strong demand in the domestic market  where prices  although lower overall in fiscal year  improved from levels in the first half of the year  as well as to greater timber harvesting in as a result of improved logging conditions over those experienced in fiscal year export sales in the timber segment were million  or  of timber net sales compared with million  or  for fiscal year this decrease was a result of export price and volume declines 
fiscal year timber operating profit was million  compared with million for fiscal year the primary reason for this decline was a decrease in average log and lumber prices  partially offset by an increase in log and lumber volume due to relatively strong demand in the domestic market and less curtailment of harvesting in fiscal year  which resulted in some shifting of export sales to domestic sales 
paper and paperboard fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease paper and paperboard net sales  millions paper and paperboard operating profit  millions paper  tons   paperboard  tons   paper  ton fob mill equivalent paperboard  ton fob mill equivalent fiscal year paper and paperboard net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in paper and paperboard volume  along with a decrease in paperboard pricing  partially offset by an increase in paper pricing 
paperboard volume decreased by primarily as a result of our decision not to sell into the asian market at prices that were depressed due to a general worsening of business conditions in asia and the strength of the us dollar 
in addition  chinese and other asian producers added kraft top recycled linerboard capacity that tended to reduce export kraft linerboard prices 
as a result of our decision  we have fully curtailed our least efficient paperboard machine in addition to curtailing two other machines to match production with incoming orders 
fiscal year export sales in the paper and paperboard segment were million  or  of paper and paperboard net sales  compared with million  or  for fiscal year paper volume decreased as a result of a general economic slowdown in the us market and increased competition from european producers in the export market due to  among other things  strength in the us dollar 
however  paper prices increased due to a change in our product mix as we continued to increase sales of tea kraft paper in the domestic market and other value added products 
fiscal year paper and paperboard operating profit was million  compared with million for fiscal year operating profits were negatively impacted by a increase in the average cost of wood chips 
in fiscal year  residual wood chip costs increased and we used a greater proportion of more expensive wood chips from whole log chipping operations 
we have since reduced our use of whole log chips and are taking advantage of page lower cost residual chips 
operating profits were also negatively affected by increased costs caused by low machine utilization rates in the first half of fiscal year and higher energy prices 
operating profits were favorably impacted by the profits from the sale of electrical power allocated to the paper and paperboard segment 
we allocated million to the segment operating profit as a result of power sales in fiscal year  compared with million in fiscal year the basis for this allocation was consistent with the method used to allocate identifiable assets and other costs between segments 
these sales had the effect of significantly increasing our energy costs for operation of the paper and paperboard segment as well as increasing our requirements for natural gas used to fuel the co generation facility 
due to the increased sale of power in fiscal year  plus the increased cost of natural gas  energy costs increased from to of paper and paperboard and converted products net sales including allocated power sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
however  energy prices have decreased in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and we expect decreased sales of energy into the market in fiscal year the longview mill operated at of capacity during fiscal year compared with during fiscal year converted products fiscal years ended october percentage increase decrease converted products sales  millions converted products operating profit  millions converted products  tons   converted products  ton fiscal year converted products net sales were million  compared with million for fiscal year converted products volume decreased due to general softening of the economy 
converted product pricing was favorably impacted by increased sales of value added products such as point of purchase displays and higher quality print orders 
our specialty products  which we identify as print jobs with four colors or more  jobs with a high percentage of die cuts and other enumerated converted products  represented of our converted products net sales for fiscal year  compared with for fiscal year fiscal year converted products operating profit was million  compared with million for the fiscal year operating profits were negatively impacted by the increased cost of paper and paperboard supplied to us by the longview mill and increased converting costs  including labor and converting supplies  offset by the favorable impact of the profits from the sale of electrical power allocated to the converted products segment 
the increase in paper and paperboard cost was due to the longview mill s increased cost of wood chips and natural gas and power related costs described above and the increased costs due to a lower operating rate at the mill 
the average mill cost of paper and paperboard supplied to our converting plants increased by for fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year the increased cost was also partially attributable to the increased use of high quality paperboard used in manufacturing value added products 
we allocated million to the segment operating profit as a result of power sales in fiscal year  compared with million in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the decreases in fiscal years and were primarily due to decreases in page operating profits during each of those fiscal years 
for the fiscal year  net cash provided by operations was negatively impacted by a million operating loss attributable to power sales compared to million of operating profit attributable to power sales in fiscal year we do not expect power sales to meaningfully contribute to cash provided by operations for fiscal year net cash used for investing was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year our capital expenditures  including timberland acquisitions  plant and equipment maintenance and improvements and environmental compliance  were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year in fiscal year  we started a capital program to enable us to increase our domestic converted products business in an effort to reduce our reliance on selling into the competitive export paperboard market 
this program has been substantially completed 
significant capital expenditures in included the construction of our new bowling green  kentucky converting plant  purchasing of flexo folder gluers  expansion of the material handling system and other equipment upgrades at our spanish fork  utah converting plant  upgrading our amsterdam  new york converting facility by expanding the building  increasing the corrugator s capacity and purchasing a flexo folder gluer  and the completion of the replacement of the press section of a paper machine which began in significant capital expenditures in fiscal year included the purchase of a corrugator for our spanish fork converting plant  the construction of our seward  nebraska converting plant  the rebuilding of a paper machine  and the commencement of work to replace the press section on a paper machine 
as a result of these substantial capital investments  we substantially reduced our capital expenditures for fiscal capital expenditures are expected to total approximately million for fiscal year  and between to million for fiscal year  including expenditures for timber purchases  plant and equipment maintenance and improvements and environmental compliance 
net cash used for financing was million in fiscal year  while net cash provided by financing was million in fiscal year and net cash used for financing was million in fiscal year the change for primarily reflects a million decrease in borrowings resulting from reduced capital expenditures and dividends 
the change in fiscal year primarily reflects a million increase in borrowings during fiscal year to fund capital expenditures such as the construction of our bowling green  kentucky converting plant and the purchase of founders stock for million 
debt increased by million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we did not purchase shares of our stock 
during fiscal years and  we purchased an aggregate of  and  shares of our stock for approximately million and million  respectively 
each quarter we determine the amount of our dividend based on operating results  current market conditions and debt levels 
cash dividends of per share were declared and paid in the first fiscal quarter of in the aggregate amount of million 
there were no additional dividends declared or paid in the remainder of fiscal year the first fiscal quarter dividend reduction from prior levels was based on fourth fiscal quarter earnings 
the suspension of the dividend for the remainder of fiscal year was due primarily to the net loss incurred in the first six months of and economic conditions that were negatively affecting our business 
during fiscal year  we declared and paid total dividends of per share  for an aggregate amount of million 
dividends of per share were paid in fiscal year in the aggregate amount of million 
our primary financing arrangements restrict the amount of dividends we may declare based on certain financial performance tests 
however  the suspension of our dividend is not a result of those restrictions 
page during the first fiscal quarter  we closed an offering of million senior subordinated notes due the notes and entered into a new three year million senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
the proceeds of the notes and the initial borrowing under the new revolving credit facility were used to repay and cancel our million revolving credit facility  prepay million of series b senior notes due april   pay transaction costs relating to the notes and the new revolving credit facility and irrevocably place into an escrow account million  the amount that  together with interest accrued in the escrow account  was sufficient to repay our million senior notes due august   at their maturity 
in the second fiscal quarter  we entered into two fixed to floating interest rate swaps  for a total of million of the million of senior subordinated notes  at an initial basis points above libor 
the purpose of the swaps is to manage our exposure to fixed rate debt by converting a portion of our outstanding debt from a fixed to a lower variable interest rate 
in october  due to lower interest rates and changes in the yield curve  we monetized the gain on the fixed to floating swaps of million by terminating the swap agreements and simultaneously entering into two new fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
the proceeds of the million gain were used to repay debt and will be recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt  which matures in under the new swaps  fixed interest payments on million of notes was swapped for variable rate payments at an initial basis points above libor  and million of notes at basis points above libor 
at october   our financial position for borrowed debt included long term debt of million  including current installments of long term debt of million 
additionally  short term borrowings at october  were million 
at october   we had million outstanding under our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
in addition  we had million of notes outstanding 
also outstanding at october   were other various senior notes totaling million  million under an unsecured and uncommitted bank line of credit  and revenue bonds of million 
our financing arrangements require us to be in compliance with certain financial covenants  including minimum net worth  short and long term borrowing ratio  current ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio requirements and restrict our payment of dividends 
the company was in compliance with such covenants at october  for the quarter ended july   we obtained amendments from the holders of certain senior notes with respect to compliance with covenants that require us to maintain a specified ratio of net income available for fixed charges to fixed charges 
the amendments reducing the coverage requirements are effective for the quarters ended july  through april  in connection with the grant of amendments we agreed to pay certain fees 
as a result of amendments to certain senior notes obtained in  we continue to pay an additional per annum over the original note coupon rates until an investment grade credit rating is obtained for our unsecured debt 
during fiscal year  our outstanding debt generally exceeded historical levels due to borrowings made in connection with substantial expenditures related to the capital improvement program that we have engaged in since fiscal year  plus some timberland acquisitions  as well as the payment of dividends and stock repurchases in and decreased operating profit in fiscal years and as compared to fiscal year we have substantially completed the capital investment program initiated in and reduced our debt to million at the end of fiscal year from million at the end of fiscal year and million at january  we expect to continue to reduce debt to more moderate levels by continuing substantial reduction of capital expenditures over the next few years and improving operating results by reducing our raw material costs  lowering our page cost of procurement and balancing our staffing levels consistent with current orders 
in addition  we have suspended our dividend until operating profits and cash flow return to more acceptable levels 
as of october   our aggregate annual debt principal repayments are as follows principal fiscal year amount a  a includes million drawn on our million revolving credit facility 
we believe that our cash flow generated from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our uncommitted line of credit provide sufficient resources to fund operations and to meet our debt payment obligations and foreseeable capital expenditure requirements 
other we continually review any known environmental exposures including the cost of remediation 
at the present time  we are not aware of any environmental liabilities that would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with federal  state and local laws regarding environmental quality  the environmental protection agency epa has issued a final air and water quality rule referred to as the cluster rule 
we estimate that over the next to years required pollution control capital expenditures could range from million to million 
we have included these estimated expenditures in our capital expenditure budget discussed above 
although future pollution control expenditures cannot be predicted with any certainty and could continue to escalate because of continuing changes in laws and regulations and uncertainty as to how they will be interpreted and applied  we believe that compliance with these regulations will not have a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
as part of an industry supported effort  forestry regulations have been developed in oregon and washington to protect salmon 
these regulations restrict the harvest of timber near streams and other environmentally sensitive areas  thereby reducing the timber that can be harvested and increasing costs 
our exposure to market risks on our financial instruments is limited to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  including debt under our revolving credit facilities and interest rate swaps 
the interest rates applied to our variable rate borrowings and swaps are adjusted often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates 
interest expense incurred annually related to our variable rate debt is dependent upon the amount outstanding during the year and the extent to which interest rates rise and fall 
we do not engage in commodity  currency or interest rate hedging arrangements or engage in transactions involving derivatives  other than our entering into two interest rate swaps to page obtain a lower effective interest rate on our borrowings 
see note to our financial statements included in item for a more detailed discussion of our interest rate swaps 
if the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt increased by per annum  our annual interest expense would increase by million based on our outstanding debt as of october  forward looking statements this annual report contains forward looking statements  including statements concerning anticipated improvement of operating results and earnings and expected cost reductions  anticipated reductions in working capital needs  including reducing inventory and raw materials  anticipated pricing and market conditions for the company s products  energy and certain raw materials  including log  paper  paperboard and converted products pricing and demand  costs of power  anticipated reductions in the amount of natural gas purchased from third parties and the cost of wood chips  expected log harvest levels and customer and product focus  improvement of reliability and uptime of equipment  creating a more steady operation and better management of raw material purchases  anticipated savings and improvements to financial results from various business improvement projects and programs  including from procurement teams and processes and other reductions in spending  expected capital expenditures and the completion and results of capital expenditure projects  expected reductions of debt  possible effects of changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and currencies of important export markets  anticipated contribution to results from sales of energy  anticipated competitive conditions  anticipated cost of compliance with certain environmental regulations  and effects of environmental contingencies and litigation on financial conditions and results of operations 
forward looking statements are based on the company s estimates and projections on the date they are made  and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties 
actual events could differ materially from those anticipated by the company due to a variety of factors  including those factors outlined in the following factors that may affect our future operating results and  among others developments in the world  national  or regional economy or involving the company s customers or competitors affecting supply of or demand for the company s products  energy or raw materials  changes in product  energy or raw material prices  delays in the implementation of cost savings initiatives or the failure to obtain expected benefits from cost savings initiatives  page capital project delay  cost overruns or unforeseen maintenance on capital assets  unforeseen developments in the company s business  adverse changes in the capital markets or interest rates affecting the cost or availability of financing  or other unforeseen events 
we do not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements should circumstances or our estimates or projections change 
factors that may affect our future operating results you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this report 
they are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock and other securities could decline 
cyclical industry conditions and commodity pricing have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results reflect the general cyclical pattern of the forest  paper and packaging products industries 
most of our products are commodity products and are subject to competition from other timber companies and paper and paperboard products manufacturers worldwide 
historically  prices for our products have been volatile  and we  like other participants in the forest  paper and packaging products industries  have limited influence over the timing and extent of price changes for our products 
product pricing is significantly affected by the relationship between supply and demand in the forest  paper and packaging products industries 
product supply is influenced primarily by fluctuations in available manufacturing capacity 
demand is affected by the state of the economy in general and a variety of other factors 
the demand for our timber is primarily affected by the level of new residential construction activity and home repair and remodeling activity 
demand for our paper and packaging products is primarily affected by the state of the global economy in general and the economies in north america and east asia in particular 
due to generally weak worldwide economic conditions  global demand for our paper and paperboard products has generally declined 
for instance  the average price per thousand board feet we realized from the sale of logs declined to in fiscal year from in fiscal year  and over the same period  the average price per ton we realized from the sale of paper declined to from  the average price per ton we realized from the sale of paperboard declined to from  and the average price per ton we realized from the sale of converted products declined to from see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a prolonged and severe weakness in the markets for one or more of our principal products could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our cash requirements  including the payment of interest and principal on our debt 
our industries are highly competitive and subject to wide price fluctuations that could adversely affect our results of operations 
the forest  paper and packaging products industries are highly competitive globally  and no single company is dominant 
these industries have suffered  and continue to suffer  from excess capacity 
during fiscal year  our longview mill operated at of capacity 
these industries are also capital page intensive  which leads to high fixed costs and generally results in continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover marginal costs 
our competitors include large  vertically integrated forest  paper and packaging products companies and numerous smaller companies 
larger companies that compete with us in each of our markets may be better able to withstand the adverse nature of the business cycle because they may have greater financial resources than we do 
in the past  we have seen significant competition in the japanese timber market as european competitors have benefited from the strength of the us dollar relative to the euro 
these conditions have contributed substantial price competition and volatility within our industry  especially during periods of reduced demand 
during the latter half of fiscal  the us dollar has gradually weakened which has had a positive effect on european competition in the japanese lumber market and in turn gave the japanese buyer an advantage to purchase us wood products 
if this trend reverses  future decreases in prices for our products would adversely affect our operating results 
these factors  coupled with our substantial leveraged position  may harm our ability to respond to competition and other market conditions 
price fluctuations in raw materials could adversely affect our ability to obtain the materials needed to manufacture our products 
the most significant raw material used in our operations is fiber  including wood  recycled and other fiber  which during fiscal year accounted for of our costs of products produced in our paper and paperboard segment  not including shipping  warehousing and outward freight 
we obtained approximately of our wood fiber requirements at open market prices during fiscal year we also obtained almost all of our recycled fiber on the open market 
wood and recycled fiber are both subject to commodity pricing  which fluctuates on the basis of market factors over which we have no control 
in addition  the cost of fiber that we purchase in the market has at times fluctuated greatly because of economic or industry conditions  particularly the conditions in the pacific northwest  where we purchase most of our fiber 
further  our access to wood fiber could be adversely affected by consolidation of sawmills in the pacific northwest that supply wood fiber to our longview mill  mill closures due to oversupplied domestic lumber markets  as well as more stringent environmental or other regulations affecting the supply or cost of timber to those sawmills 
we may not be able to pass any future raw material cost increases through to our customers through product price increases 
our inability to pass increased costs through to our customers could harm our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
our operations require substantial capital and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 
our operations require substantial capital 
capital requirements for expansion  replacement and maintenance of existing facilities or equipment or to comply with existing and future changes in environmental laws and regulations may be substantial 
although we maintain our equipment with regular periodic and scheduled maintenance  we cannot assure you that key pieces of equipment will not need to be repaired or replaced or that we will not incur significant additional costs associated with environmental compliance 
the costs of repairing or replacing equipment and the associated downtime of an affected production line could harm our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
if our future capital resources are inadequate to provide for our operating needs  capital expenditures and other cash requirements on economic terms  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be harmed 
we are subject to significant environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures and liabilities 
our businesses are subject to many federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  particularly with respect to the page restoration and reforestation of timberlands  harvesting timber near waterways  discharges of pollutants and emissions  and the management  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances or other contaminants 
compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business and we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  significant expenditures to remain in compliance 
we expect that the environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject will become more stringent and more stringently enforced in the future 
our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions  including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures  installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions 
some environmental laws and regulations impose liability and responsibility on present and former owners  operators or users of facilities and sites for contamination at such facilities and sites without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination 
investigations may lead to discoveries of contamination that must be remediated  and closures of facilities may trigger compliance requirements that are not applicable to operating facilities 
consequently  we cannot assure you that existing or future circumstances or developments with respect to contamination  including unanticipated discovery of contamination or discharges of hazardous substances  will not require significant expenditures by us or that internally generated funds or other sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures 
some environmental laws permit individuals  citizens groups and other third parties to file claims against us based upon alleged violations of laws or damages to property stemming from contamination  or upon alleged injury to persons stemming from exposure to hazardous substances used or otherwise controlled by us 
we may be required to expend significant sums to defend and or settle existing or future claims 
high energy costs could adversely affect our results of operations 
energy costs are a significant variable operating expense for us and are susceptible to rapid and substantial price increases 
our average cost of electricity increased from per mkwh  or thousand kilowatt hours  to per mkwh from fiscal year to fiscal year  and our average cost of natural gas increased from per mmbtu  or million british thermal units  to per mmbtu during the same periods 
we have not been able  and in the future may not be able  to pass all increased energy costs through to our customers 
in addition  the primary contracts pursuant to which we advantageously purchased and sold power in the past have expired and  under current terms  we have less flexibility in our ability to mitigate the costs of energy used by our facilities 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in fluctuations in demand for our products 
while all of our revenues are earned in us dollars  a large portion of our sales are made to customers operating in markets that use currencies other than us dollars 
for the fiscal year  exports accounted for over of our total sales 
of this amount  of our total sales came from timber export sales  primarily to japan  and of our total sales came from export sales of paper and paperboard  primarily to hong kong  canada and southeast asia 
strength in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies of these countries could make it more expensive for our customers operating in foreign markets to purchase our products  could make our products less price competitive with our foreign competitors  and could consequently reduce the demand for our products 
the value of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen had increased from jpy per us dollar on april  to jpy per us dollar on april   but has subsequently weakened to page jpy per us dollar as of december  a reduction in demand for our products as a result of strengthening the us dollar could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  adverse currency valuations could make paper and paperboard from foreign competitors more price competitive in the us market 
this situation has caused  and from time to time in the future may cause  excess supply of paper and paperboard in the united states  which  in turn  will likely result in a decrease in us paper and paperboard prices 
our substantial debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from responding to economic  industry or competitive conditions and fund operational requirements 
we have a significant amount of debt 
at our october  fiscal year end  we had million of borrowed debt 
our substantial amount of debt could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt  thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future capital expenditures  working capital and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the forest  paper and packaging products industries  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds  even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity 
natural disasters or other events may cause losses to our timber holdings or limit our ability to harvest our timber 
the volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our lands may be limited by natural disasters and other events such as fire  insect infestation  disease  ice storms  wind storms  flooding  other weather conditions and other causes 
the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  as is typical in the industry  we do not maintain insurance for any loss of our standing timber from natural disasters or other causes 
in addition  fire and other natural disasters in adjacent or nearby timberlands may limit our access to  or impede our ability to harvest  our timber 
in periods of poor logging conditions  we may harvest less timber than expected  thus impacting our net sales of timber during that period 
our business and financial performance may be harmed by future labor disruptions 
approximately  of our employees  or over of our workforce  are parties to collective bargaining agreements 
as a result  there is a risk of work stoppage due to strikes or walkouts 
we have collective bargaining agreements expiring at various times through calendar year  including one agreement covering approximately employees that will expire during calendar year any significant work stoppage as a result of the failure to successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
page our pulp and paper mill and all of our paper machines are located at a single complex in longview  washington 
our pulp and paper mill and all of our paper machines are located at a single acre complex in longview  washington 
since we do not have pulp and paper production elsewhere  a material disruption at our mill could result in a material disruption of our paper making operations 
such disruptions could be caused by prolonged power failures  a breakdown of our continuous pulp digesters or recovery furnaces  chemical spill or release  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure including railroad tracks  bridges  tunnels and roads  or fires  floods  earthquakes or other disasters 
although we currently have certain business insurance and replacement value insurance  we cannot assure you that we are adequately insured to cover the total amount of any losses caused by any of the above events 
in addition  we are not insured against any losses due to interruptions in our business due to damage to or destruction of our longview pulp and paper making complex caused by earthquakes or to major transportation infrastructure disruptions or other events that do not occur on our premises 
a disruption in our pulp and paper operations would also adversely affect our converting plants  which in fiscal year obtained approximately of their paper and paperboard requirements from our mill 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we generally do not engage in commodity  currency or interest rate hedging arrangements or engage in transactions involving derivatives  but we have entered into two interest rate swaps to obtain a lower effective interest rate on our borrowings 
see note to our financial statements included in item for a more detailed discussion of our interest rate swaps 
our exposure to market risks on our financial instruments is limited to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  including debt under our revolving credit facilities 
the interest rates applied to our variable rate borrowings are adjusted often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates 
interest expense incurred annually related to our variable rate debt is dependent upon the amount outstanding during the year and the extent to which interest rates rise and fall 
if the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt increased by per annum  our annual interest expense would increase by million based on our outstanding debt as of october  page
