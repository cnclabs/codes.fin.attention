general we are a diversified industrial manufacturer operating in three segments tools  water  and enclosures 
our tools segment manufactures and markets a wide range of power tools under several brand names generating approximately percent of total revenues 
our water segment manufactures and markets essential products for 
table of contents the transport  storage  and treatment of water and wastewater and generates approximately percent of total revenues 
our enclosures segment accounts for approximately percent of total revenues  and designs  manufactures  and markets standard  modified and custom enclosures that protect sensitive controls and components for markets that include industrial machinery  data communications  networking  telecommunications  test and measurement  automotive  medical  security  defense  and general electronics 
in our management s discussion and analysis  we make reference to certain non gaap generally accepted accounting principles financial measures  including gross profit  operating income  selling  general and administrative sg a  income from continuing operations before income taxes  and provision for income taxes  in each case excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring charges or excluding restructuring charge 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they provide investors with another measure to consider  in conjunction with the gaap results  that may be helpful to meaningfully compare our operating performance between periods 
we also use these non gaap financial measures when assessing our own operating performance 
a description of the accounting standards applicable to the elimination of the amortization of goodwill is included below under new accounting standards 
a description of the restructuring charges that we exclude from gaap results is included below under results of operations restructuring charges 
in each case below when we make reference to a non gaap financial measure  we also provide a reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure

volume price currency total net sales in totaled  million  compared with  million in  and  million in in  volume increased by approximately percent primarily due to increased demand and acquisitions in both our tools and water segments 
these increases were mostly offset by the continued weak demand for our enclosures segment products 
price declined by approximately percent primarily due to the introduction of lower price point products and promotional discounting for our tools segment products 
in addition  the continued weakening of the us dollar in favorably impacted the dollar value of sales by about percent 
the percent or million decline in net sales in compared to reflected volume declines in each of our businesses resulting from a weak global economy and a stronger us dollar  which reduced the dollar value of foreign sales by about percent

vs 
in thousands change change change change tools water enclosures total 
table of contents tools the percent increase in tools segment sales in was primarily due to higher sales volume in our devilbiss air power company dapc business  particularly for pressure washers  higher sales volume in our delta business as a result of our new sub branding strategy through the creation of delta shopmaster and delta industrial brands 
the delta shopmaster brand is targeted toward the entry level do it yourselfer and the delta industrial brand is targeted toward the professional craftsman  and the fourth quarter acquisition of oldham saw co  inc oldham saw 
these increases were partially offset by declines in average selling prices due to the introduction of lower price point products for the delta shopmaster brand and heavy second half promotional discounting in a more competitive marketplace 
the percent decline in tools segment sales in was primarily due to lower sales volume due to the weak economy  and lower average selling prices stemming from the mid price discounting activities 
water the percent increase in water segment sales in was primarily due to higher pump sales  with most of the growth coming from the residential retail and municipal markets  the fourth quarter acquisition of plymouth products  inc plymouth products  and higher sales volume in our pool and spa equipment business 
the percent decline in water segment sales in was primarily due to lower sales volume for our industrial pumps and components for large water filtration systems as a weaker economy slowed demand  and unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales volume in our pool and spa equipment business as we increased market share 
enclosures the percent decline in enclosures segment sales in was primarily due to lower sales volume reflecting severely reduced capital spending in the industrial market and over capacity and weak demand in the datacom and telecom markets  partially offset by favorable foreign currency effects 
the percent decline in enclosures segment sales in was primarily due to lower sales volume attributable to sharp declines in all enclosures markets and unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation  somewhat offset by increased sales due to the expansion in the number of hoffman distributors

these increases were partially offset by volume declines in our enclosures segment  and unfavorable selling prices due to increased promotional discounting in our tools segment 
the percentage point decline in gross profit as a percent of sales in from was primarily the result of sharply lower sales volume and unfavorable product mix in our enclosures segment  partially offset by improved gross margins in our tools segment due to material price savings and other cost reduction programs and the establishment of additional inventory valuation reserves in of million

funding of future payments will be paid from cash generated from operating activities 
as a result of our restructuring charge program  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
workforce reductions related to the restructuring charge are for approximately employees  of whom were terminated in and employee termination benefits consist primarily of severance and outplacement counseling fees 
employee termination benefits for the restructuring charge includes a million non cash charge for the intrinsic value of stock options modified as part of a severance agreement 
non cash asset disposals for the and restructuring charges were for the write down of equipment  leasehold improvements  and inventory only as a direct result of our decisions to exit certain facilities and the abandonment of internal use software under development

investing activities capital expenditures in   and were million including million for the acquisition of a previously leased facility or percent of sales  million or percent of sales  and million or percent of sales  respectively 
we anticipate capital expenditures in to be approximately primarily in the areas of new product development and general maintenance capital 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired plymouth products and oldham saw for million cash  net of cash acquired plus debt assumed of million 
the acquisitions are subject to final purchase price adjustments 
we have invested approximately million to acquire a percent interest in certain joint venture operations of an asian supplier for bench top tools  of which million was paid for in the year ended december  and an additional million was paid in we hold options to increase our ownership interest in these joint ventures to percent 
in the first quarter of  we acquired taunus  a brazilian enclosures manufacturer  for million 
the acquisition was financed through borrowings under our credit facilities 
in the second quarter of  we received million for the settlement of a purchase price dispute related to a acquisition 
the amount received was accounted for as a reduction of goodwill 
we periodically review our array of businesses in comparison to our overall strategic and performance objectives 
as part of this review  we may routinely acquire or divest certain businesses 
financing activities at december   our capital structure consisted of million in total indebtedness and  million in shareholders equity 
the ratio of debt to total capital was percent  compared with percent at december  our targeted debt to total capital ratio range is approximately percent 
we will exceed this target from time to time as needed for operational purposes and or acquisitions

table of contents long term debt and lines of credit are explained in detail in item  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating leases are explained in detail in item  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had million in committed revolving credit facilities the facilities with various banks consisting of a million day facility that expires on august   and million of multi currency facilities  of which million expires on august  and million expires on september  interest rates and fees on the facilities vary based on our credit ratings 
we believe we will be able to pay or refinance debt coming due in the near term through cash generated from operations combined with our ability to borrow as necessary in the financial markets 
our current credit ratings are as follows rating agency long term debt rating standard poor s bbb moody s baa the weighted average interest rate for borrowings under the facilities during and was percent and percent  respectively 
credit available under existing facilities  as limited by our most restrictive financial covenant  was approximately million and is based on a ratio of total debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
in addition  our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants that restrict the amount we pay for dividends and require us to maintain certain financial ratios and a minimum net worth 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december  in addition to the facilities  we have million of uncommitted credit facilities  under which we had million outstanding as of december  in  we issued financial stand by letters of credit to secure our performance to third parties under self insurance programs  certain legal matters  and other commitments in the ordinary course of business 
as of december   we had stand by letters of credit outstanding of million 
dividends paid in were million  compared with million in  and million in the year over year increases reflect an increase in our annual per share dividend of in  compared with in  and in we have paid dividends for the past years and anticipate paying future dividends 
we believe cash generated from operating activities  together with credit available under committed and uncommitted facilities and our current cash position  will provide adequate short term and long term liquidity 
other financial measures in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating  investing  and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows  we also measure our free cash flow 
we define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures  including both continuing and discontinued operations 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance and have a long term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds a percent conversion of net income 
we believe our ability to convert net income into free cash flow gives us opportunities to invest in new growth initiatives to create shareholder value 
in  we generated free cash flow of million  compared with million in  and million in 
table of contents off balance sheet financing at december   we were a party to a synthetic leasing arrangement for a distribution center and office building in our tools segment

at december   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
commitments and contingencies environmental we have been named as defendants  targets  or potentially responsible parties prps in a small number of environmental cleanups  in which our current or former business units have generally been given deminimis status 
to date  none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs  fines  penalties  or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations 
we have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases  such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in  as well as the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in  we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations 
we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities 
in addition  there are pending environmental issues concerning a limited number of sites  including one site in los angeles  california 
this was acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in and relates to operations no longer carried out at that site 
we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites 
we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 
we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future  for both divested and acquired businesses 
when it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites  provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
as of december   our reserve for such environmental liabilities was approximately million 
we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 
new accounting standards effective january   we adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
this new standard requires that certain payments to our customers for cooperative advertising and certain sales incentive offers that were historically classified as selling  general and administrative expense be reclassified and shown as a reduction in net sales 
eitf issue no 
also requires the reclassification of previously reported results of operations for periods prior to the adoption to conform to the current presentation 
accordingly  previously reported net sales for and were reduced by million and million with an offsetting reduction in selling expense  respectively 
the adoption of this new standard had no impact on previously reported operating income  net income  or earnings per share 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life not be amortized 
instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life  the statement requires a test for impairment to be performed annually  or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january   and as a result  no longer record goodwill amortization 
an initial assessment of the recoverability of goodwill recorded on the date of adoption was completed in the second 
table of contents quarter of additionally  we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of no impairment was present upon performing either of the impairment tests 
the fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated by an independent third party using a combination of the discounted cash flow  market comparable  and market capitalization approaches 
had we accounted for goodwill under sfas no 
for all prior periods presented  our net income and earnings per share from continuing operations would have been as follows in thousands  except per share data reported net income continuing operations add back goodwill amortization less income taxes adjusted net income continuing operations reported earnings per share basic continuing operations goodwill amortization  net of taxes adjusted earnings per share basic continuing operations reported earnings per share diluted continuing operations goodwill amortization  net of taxes adjusted earnings per share diluted continuing operations weighted average common shares outstanding basic diluted in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this new standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt sfas no 
on january  and have determined that the adoption of this new standard will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  however  it retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations 
it also expands on the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
this new standard will require gains and losses on the extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under sfas no 
extraordinary treatment will be required for certain extinguishments as provided in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
sfas no 
also amends 
table of contents sfas no 
to require certain modifications to capital leases to be treated as a sale leaseback and modifies the accounting for sub leases when the original lessee remains a secondary obligor or guarantor 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued after may   and with respect to the impact of the reporting requirements of changes made to sfas no 
 for fiscal years beginning after may  the adoption of these provisions did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
pentair will adopt the remaining provisions of sfas no

in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this new standard nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit activity that does not involve an entity newly acquired in a business combination or with a disposal activity covered by sfas no 
 be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with earlier application encouraged 
we will adopt sfas no 
on january  we do not expect that sfas no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
pentair will continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with apb opinion no 
as such  we do not expect this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
at december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
interpretation no 
elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees 
it also clarifies that at the time an entity issues a guarantee  the issuing entity must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee 
however  the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply to product warranties  guarantees accounted for as derivatives  or other guarantees of an entity s own future performance 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation as of december  the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we have not yet determined the effect of adopting the initial recognition and measurement provisions on pentair s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities vie  an interpretation of arb no 
 which requires all vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the vie 
in addition  the interpretation expands disclosure requirements for both vies that are consolidated as well as vies from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of the beneficial interests  but not the majority 
the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for all financial statements issued after january  the consolidation requirements of this interpretation are effective for all periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this new standard to have any effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our critical accounting estimates include the following impairment of goodwill in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting rules for goodwill effective january   we performed our initial assessment test  and also completed our annual impairment test of goodwill  and found no impairment 
the fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated by an independent third party using a combination of the discounted cash flow  market comparable  and market capitalization approaches 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about projected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
if these estimates change  we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
impairment of long lived assets including cost and equity method investments we review the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used  such as property  plant and equipment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
impairment losses on long lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets 
the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long lived assets 
at the end of  we have million invested in certain privately held companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods 
we write down or write off an investment and recognize a loss when events or circumstances indicate there is impairment in the investment that is other than temporary 
this requires significant judgment  including assessment of the investees financial condition  and in certain cases the possibility of subsequent rounds of financing  as well as the investees historical results of operations  and projected results and cash flows 
if the actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different from projections  we may incur future charges for the impairment of these investments 
pension during  asset returns for our us domestic defined benefit pension plans were adversely affected by continued deterioration in the equity markets 
in addition  interest rates have declined  which resulted in a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure these plans from percent in to percent in the lower asset returns and discount rates have unfavorably impacted the year end funded status and increased our pension expense and plan contributions 

table of contents the decrease in the discount rate caused an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation  and the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair market value of plan assets at december  this unfunded accumulated benefit obligation  plus the existing prepaid asset  was the primary cause of a million net of tax charge to shareholders equity for this charge did not impact earnings 
total net periodic pension benefits cost was million in  million in  and million in total net periodic pension benefits cost is expected to be approximately million in the expected increase in net periodic pension cost in from is primarily due to a decrease in asset returns and a decrease in the discount rate 
the net periodic pension benefit cost for has been estimated assuming a discount rate of percent and an expected return on plan assets of percent 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of net periodic pension cost ultimately recognized 
for purposes of determining the expected return on assets component of net periodic pension cost  the market related value of assets is calculated by amortizing over a five year period any differences between actual and expected return on assets 
other differences between assumed and actual experience are deferred as unrecognized gains and losses 
unrecognized gains and losses in excess of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  minimum threshold requirements are amortized over a ten to fifteen year period 
pension contributions in totaled million  including million of contributions to domestic defined benefit plans 
the million contribution exceeded the minimum funding requirement 
our pension contributions are expected to be in the range of million to million
