item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discussion of results of operations shipments  orders backlog net orders    percentage increase decrease net sales shipments    percentage increase decrease backlog at december    percentage increase decrease a large contract  approximately  in anticipated revenue  for a custom engineered hydraulic power unit with electronic controls used to power and control a forty thousand ton open die forging press being installed in central france was the primary cause for net orders to increase by in compared to without this contract net orders would have decreased by in we will use the percentage of completion method of accounting for this order 
all of the net sales from this contract should be recognized in and the continued low level of customer spending for capital goods in in the domestic and international geographic segments was the primary cause for an approximately decrease in net sales from engineered construction contracts 
this low level of spending caused the domestic and the international segment s net sales to decrease approximately and  respectively  from the weaker dollar against the british pound sterling and the euro helped the european segment s net sales to increase by approximately from a decrease in net orders in led to a decrease in net sales  million of net sales in when compared to the million of net sales in the company uses the percentage of completion method of accounting to recognize net sales from its engineered construction contracts 
a large order of this type  approximately  was recognized in december  most of the revenue for this order was recognized in  causing net sales from engineered construction contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting to increase by in when compared to net sales of product for which the company does not use the percentage of completion method of accounting decreased by in from the soft demand in the world economy for fluid power products in had a negative effect on the performance of all three of the company s geographic segments 
the domestic  european and international segments net sales decreased by  and  respectively in the strong dollar also accounted for some of the decrease in the european and international segments 
the percent change in the average of the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the results of the european and international segments to us dollars was approximately negative and negative  respectively 
gross profit gross profit    gross profit margin percentage increase decrease the large decrease in net sales previously discussed  together with relatively high aggregate sales of products with lower profit margins  were the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit margin to in from in to offset the decrease in net sales  the company reduced its labor force by approximately in total  including an approximately decrease in the domestic segment  reduced pay to salaried workers  kept overtime pay to a minimum  plant shutdowns  outsourced items made in our factories to lower cost vendors  installed lean manufacturing techniques in our factories  negotiated a more favorable three year union contract  and in late  closed our factory in longview  texas 
these cost decreases were partially offset by cost increases in healthcare benefits  insurance  energy  pension benefits and unfavorable utilization variances created by the lower utilization of our production facilities 
gross profit margin decreased to in compared to in gross profit margin was down in primarily for five reasons 
first  the strong us dollar increased pricing pressure due to stronger competition from foreign producers when selling products made in the united states to foreign markets 
second  the recession in the fluid power industry increased competitive pressures because firms competed for a smaller amount of potential orders 
third  we added costs related to the learning curve on new products and applications for those products 
fourth  the approximate  of special costs in decreased the margin by approximately 
fifth  lower utilization of production facilities created inefficiencies and unfavorable utilization variances 
selling  general and administrative expenses research and development    special costs   selling  general and administrative less research and development    percentage increase decrease percent of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses  less research and development and special costs  increased by in compared to the programs to decrease expenses included downsizing the labor force  reducing pay to salaried workers  keeping overtime pay to a minimum  and decreasing employee benefits 
these cost decreases were partially offset by cost increases in healthcare benefits  insurance  and pension benefits 
translating stronger foreign currencies into us dollars  the euro up  the british pound sterling up and the average of all the other foreign currencies in our international segment up slightly increased operating expenses when compared to and also offset the decreases made to operating expenses in selling  general and administrative expenses  less research and development decreased by in compared to during we aggressively reduced expenses including reducing our workforce by approximately through a combination of early retirements and layoffs 
we also reduced the hours and salaries for the remaining employees 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses are startup expenses and net losses of approximately  for and approximately  for from osl offshore machinery and deck systems osl 
osl is a company we invested in during to expand our oil and gas industry presence 
on december  we acquired the remaining interest in this company after absorbing of the net loss generated by osl in accordingly  we have consolidated osl s financials into the oilgear company s financial statements from the date we gained majority ownership 
the company s research and development expense decreased to  in compared to  in each of and cost cutting programs in were the primary reason for the change 
the company continues its commitment to the design and manufacture of new and more efficient hydraulic products to gain new customers and to new applications for the company s products 
interest expense decreased by approximately  in  primarily due to the decrease in interest rates 
an increase in interest expense by approximately  in was the result of an increase in interest bearing debt  partially offset by lower rates 
income tax effective rates were  and in  and  respectively 
changes in the valuation allowance was the principal reason for the fluctuation in effective tax rates 
also see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional reconciliation of the rates 
the net loss of  for was the result of decreased net sales  a higher proportion of products with lower profit margins  special costs of approximately  increased health care costs  increased pension costs  increased insurance costs   of losses and startup charges for osl  and increased competitive pressure due to a decrease in global capital expenditures 
the net loss of  for was the result of lower margins caused by the global weak demand for fluid power products  approximately  pre tax of special charges and approximately  pre tax of startup charges for osl to increase sales in the oil and gas industry 
outlook entering  the fourth quarter total of net orders was the lowest quarter of net orders since the third quarter of and the lowest level of backlog since  excluding the order for the  forging machine contract in france 
however  in the first two months of we have seen an improvement 
net orders increased by approximately compared to the first two months of and we are encouraged that the net orders in all three geographic segments have increased in the same two month period 
it is also encouraging that our quoting activity has increased in the past few months and our list of completed proposals for engineered construction contracts has increased as evidenced by increased communication between our engineers and our customers engineers 
however  with all of the uncertainties in the world today  we can t determine at this time whether a recovery has begun  but we hope that we have seen the worst of the current manufacturing recession 
a weaker us dollar has continued into the first two months of which should have a positive effect on net sales and gross margins in the european and international segments 
we have achieved substantial savings from cost cutting programs we have initiated during the past three years  ie reducing employment  cutting salaries  reducing benefits and hours  closing facilities in longview  tx  novi  mi and bedford  england  and lower cost outsourcing 
however  increasing costs for healthcare  pension  insurance  energy and consulting fees will offset a material part of the savings 
as part of our cost reduction and efficiency improvement efforts  we are evaluating downsizing our facility in leeds  england and moving these operations to a smaller  more efficient facility 
we have received a letter of intent to acquire our existing facility for  british pound sterling 
the offer is contingent upon receiving government authorization to convert the property to residential use and upon our ability to find a suitable site to relocate 
it is unlikely that this transaction could be consummated before the property is on our books at zero value so the transaction may provide a significant capital gain 
the large increase in backlog resulting from the  forging machine contract in france and continued pressure to reduce costs should improve the company s operating income 
however  to bring the company back to profitability in we need net orders to increase 
if there is increased world demand for capital equipment projects that require fluid power technology  then the company is ready to supply a superior level of technology required to meet those demands 
inflation and changing prices oilgear uses the lifo method of accounting for of its inventories and has reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
approximately of the total assets of the company reside in the united states and western europe 
these assets are in operation and have been maintained in good condition through the years 
management believes that inflation has not significantly distorted the net earnings loss reported by the company 
however  because of inflation and the extent to which these assets have been depreciated  management believes that the book value of the company  stated in historical dollars at per share  significantly understates the current or replacement value of the company s assets

discussion of financial position the consolidated balance sheets present the company s financial position at year end compared with the previous year end 
this financial presentation provides information intended to assist in assessing factors such as the company s liquidity and financial resources 
working capital current assets   current liabilities   working capital   current ratio working capital decreased slightly in current assets decreased by approximately  and current liabilities decreased by approximately  in causing the current ratio to increase to at december  from at december  the decrease in the dollar level of business in was the primary reason for the decrease in current assets 
the changes in current assets in came from the decrease in trade receivables  inventory  other current assets  and cash and cash equivalents 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  and prepaid expenses the changes in current liabilities in came from a decrease in short term borrowings  resulting from the negotiation of a new bank agreement with an april  expiration date  a decrease in billing in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts  and a decrease in current installments of long term debt 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in customer deposits  from cash received as a down payment on the large forging press contract  other accrued expenses  accounts payable  and accrued compensation and employee benefits 
capitalization interest bearing debt   shareholders equity   debt and equity   ratio the increase in the minimum pension liability adjustment decreased shareholders equity by  in the defined benefit pension plans in the united states contributed  to the increase in the minimum pension liability 
the continued weakness in the financial equity markets in resulted in a net investment loss of approximately  on pension plan assets 
the actuarial assumption was to earn approximately  additionally  on pension plan assets the further reduction in long term interest rates in from the rates in resulted in a reduction in the discount rate  which was the primary reason for the increase in pension benefit obligations by approximately  the remaining  of the  pension liability adjustment to shareholders equity relates to our european operations 
it resulted from the same reasons the us pension plans minimum liabilities increased investment losses and reductions in long term interest rates 
the company s milwaukee union defined benefit plan pension benefits were frozen on december  and the non union defined benefit plan pension benefits in the united states were frozen at december  the defined benefit plan pension service in the united kingdom was frozen december  also see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other reasons for the change in shareholders equity were the consolidated net loss in of approximately  partially offset by the effect of foreign currency rate changes during causing a  increase in shareholders equity

the company s common stock is traded under the symbol olgr

financial condition and liquidity the company did not comply with all of its bank covenants at september  we negotiated a new agreement in february and amended and restated it in march the amended bank agreement extended the revolving loan termination date to april  it has two term loans and a revolving line of credit facility 
the first is a term loan with a  balance as of december  and an annual interest rate of with  monthly payments with the final payment due in april of the second term loan is a new  loan with an annual interest rate equal to the greater of or libor plus to basis points with equal monthly payments totaling  in and equal monthly payments in totaling  the basis points added to libor is determined by the ratio of funded debt to ebitda  as defined 
the revolving line of credit has a bank commitment of  at an annual interest rate equal to the greater of or libor plus to basis points 
the amount available under the  bank commitment is limited by a formula which is calculated on a weekly basis 
the formula includes only domestic segment assets 
these assets include of qualifying trade receivables and of inventory  including inventory subject to percentage of completion contracts  limited to 
the variable interest rate at december  was 
these loans are secured by substantially all of the company s domestic assets 
the loan agreement contains various covenants that adjust over the term of the agreement 
the new bank loan agreement s covenants include the following the covenant for capital expenditures limits them to not greater than  for  the covenant for ebitda  as defined  sets a minimum amount of ebitda for each quarter in  and the covenant for consolidated net income or loss sets monthly minimums for the company is in compliance with all such covenants 
at december   the company had approximately  of unused borrowings availability under short term and long term credit facilities 
interest bearing debt decreased by  at december  compared with year end total debt increased by approximately  in the cash was used to fund the operating activities and additions to property  plant and equipment 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in and  in despite a net loss of  and a  use of cash in the change from contracts using percentage of completion  net cash was provided by operating activities in the net change from contracts using percentage of completion at december  compared to december  was the result of the total decrease of the dollar amount of contracts where billings are greater than costs and profits at december  and the total increase of the dollar amount of contracts where costs and profits are greater than billings at december  the primary reasons for the cash provided in were depreciation and amortizations of  the decreases in inventory by  and trade accounts receivable by  and the increase in customer deposits by  the primary reason for the cash provided by operating activities in came from the decrease in the amount of contracts on the percentage of completion method of accounting and the increase in the billings under those contracts compared to the end of the aggregate change resulting from these contracts provided  of cash flow in compared to using  of cash in net property  plant and equipment was  at december  compared to  at december  capital expenditures in were  compared to depreciation and amortization of  capital expenditures in were  compared to depreciation and amortization of  the company entered into operating lease agreements for approximately  and  in and  respectively  primarily for capital equipment most of which were machines and tools for the fremont and milwaukee manufacturing facilities

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those amounts 
a more complete description of our accounting policies is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and which require management to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
the company believes that critical accounting policies include accounting for percentage of completion contracts  accounting for allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  accounting for pensions and accounting for inventory obsolescence 
accounting for contracts using percentage of completion requires estimates of costs to complete each contract 
revenue earned is recorded based on accumulated incurred costs to total estimated costs to perform each contract 
management reviews these estimated costs on a monthly basis and revises costs and income recognized when changes in estimates occur 
to the extent the estimate of costs to complete varies  so does the timing of recording profits or losses on contracts 
management is required to make judgments  based on historical experience and future expectations  as to the collectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible 
these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value 
the company records these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances ii amounts based upon an aging schedule and iii an estimated amount  based on the company s historical experience  for issues not yet identified 
our accounting for pension benefits is primarily affected by our assumptions about the discount rate  expected and actual return on plan assets and other assumptions made by management  and is impacted by outside factors such as equity and fixed income market performance 
pension liability is principally the estimated present value of future benefits  net of plan assets 
pension expense is principally the sum of interest and service cost of the plan  less the expected return on plan assets and the amortization of the difference between our assumptions and actual experience 
the expected return on plan assets is calculated by applying an assumed rate of return to the fair value of plan assets 
if plan assets decline due to poor performance by the equity markets and or long term interest rates decline  as was experienced in and  our pension liability increases  ultimately increasing future pension expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of our employee benefit plans 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials  work in progress or finished goods 
inventory reserves are recorded for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
management uses estimates to record these reserves 
slow moving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory

subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management the company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
the company has significant foreign operations  for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in the euro and british pound sterling 
as the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the company has operations increase or decrease relative to the us dollar  the sales  expenses  profits  assets and liabilities of the company s foreign operations  as reported in the company s consolidated financial statements  increase or decrease accordingly 
if foreign exchange rates would have been collectively weaker against the us dollar in  the net loss would have increased by approximately  the company s debt structure and interest rate risk are managed through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
the company s primary exposure is to united states interest rates see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
a basis point movement in interest rates on floating rate debt outstanding at december  would result in a change in earnings loss before income taxes of approximately  the company occasionally uses forward contracts to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party material purchases  intercompany product shipments and intercompany loans
