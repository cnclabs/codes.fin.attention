item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition review of consolidated operations consolidated net sales during fiscal reached  a decline from the prior year s record sales level of  sales through fiscal had increased for eleven consecutive years 
like many other consumer product companies  our sales for fiscal were impacted by unsettled domestic economic conditions 
we also experienced heightened competitive influences  particularly in non food markets 
the relative proportion of sales and operating income contributed by each of our business segments can impact a year to year comparison of the consolidated statements of income 
the following table summarizes the sales mix and related operating income percentages achieved by the business segments over each of the last three years segment sales mix specialty foods glassware and candles automotive segment operating income specialty foods glassware and candles automotive expressed as a percentage of consolidated net sales expressed as a percentage of the related segment s net sales our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in compared with in and in over the last two years  gross margins have been particularly affected by lower margins occurring within the glassware and candles segment 
this segment has experienced significant price competition  lower fixed cost absorption on reduced production levels and  in fiscal  the impact of consolidating certain glass manufacturing operations 
in conjunction with the latter action  a restructuring charge of approximately million million after taxes was recorded 
this charge consisted of employee separation costs  pension curtailment costs  closure and cleanup costs  and the writedown of property  plant and equipment having no future utility as a result of the restructuring decision 
the plant consolidation  which affected approximately jobs  was substantially completed by june and is expected to improve capacity utilization over time 
an analysis of our restructuring activity and related liability is as follows employee separation asset other dollars in thousands costs write offs charges total restructuring provision employee separation costs   property and equipment impairment   pension curtailment closing and cleanup costs total provision    cash paid  non cash charges   accrual balance at june  included in accrued liabilities we anticipate that the remaining cash related charges will be paid by the end of the third quarter of fiscal although pressed glassware manufacturing commenced during the third quarter of fiscal at the sapulpa facility  we incurred some amount of transitional start up costs over the balance of fiscal accordingly  the benefits of this restructuring will not become fully evident until the fiscal year beginning july  gross margin as a percentage of sales of the specialty foods segment was also somewhat lower in fiscal due to higher ingredient costs 
fiscal margins were influenced by sales mix and higher levels of trade promotions  which are reflected as reductions to net sales 
gross margin as a percentage of sales within the automotive segment remained relatively flat in fiscal after having increased in fiscal as a result of the benefits of higher production efficiencies  somewhat lower material costs and the decision to exit certain lower margin floor mat business 
selling  general and administrative expenses for totaled  and decreased from the total of  the fiscal total included a second quarter provision for bad debts within the glassware and candles segment of approximately million million after taxes related to our accounts receivable exposure to kmart corporation  which filed for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in january this provision led to the increase in such costs over the fiscal levels 
improved operating income in each of the three operating segments led to consolidated operating income for fiscal totaling  a increase over fiscal income of  the fiscal total had declined by from fiscal operating income totaling  overall  compared to fiscal  fiscal results reflected strong improvement in the specialty foods and automotive segments exceeded by weaker results from the glassware and candles segment 
in january and february  we received approximately million and million  respectively  under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of cdsoa 
these amounts were recorded within the accompanying financial statements as other income 
cdsoa  which applies to our candle operations  is intended to redress the unfair dumping of imported products through annual cash payments to eligible affected companies 
certain litigation has arisen regarding cdsoa  generally  and we are also aware that other candle manufacturers have initiated certain legal proceedings against the us customs service claiming a right to share in the total proceeds paid to candle manufacturers pursuant to the provisions of cdsoa 
to date  one such case was decided by the trial court in favor of the customs service in april the trial court ruling has since been appealed by the plaintiff to the applicable federal appeals court 
if the customs service is ultimately unable to prevail in these matters  it might become asserted that the payments that we have received should be reduced by an undetermined amount through either smaller future distributions or as refunds to the customs service 
also influencing other income and expense were the impact of lower interest rates upon interest income and in fiscal a recorded gain of approximately million from insurance proceeds related to a casualty loss that occurred during january as affected by the increased cdsoa payment  our income before income taxes for fiscal of  increased over the fiscal total of  in fiscal  as similarly influenced by the initial million receipt under cdsoa  income before income taxes had increased from the level of as influenced by the cessation of nondeductible goodwill amortization as discussed below  our effective tax rate during fiscal declined to compared to and in fiscals and  respectively 
fiscal diluted earnings per share totaled  a increase from the prior year s total of 
the latter amount was more than fiscal diluted earnings per share of before the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
the fiscal accounting change related to adopting the guidance of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
as adjusted for the  or per share  after tax effect of the sab accounting change  diluted earnings per share in totaled 
earnings per share in each of the last three years has been beneficially affected by share repurchases which have totaled in excess of million over the three year period ended june  effective july   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to no longer be amortized but reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal or other means will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
amortization of other intangibles for was  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles for and was  and  respectively 
of the million in goodwill at june   approximately million relates to the specialty foods segment and approximately million relates to the automotive segment 
segment review specialty foods record levels of both net sales and earnings were again achieved by the specialty foods segment during fiscal net sales during fiscal totaled  a increase over the prior year s total of  fiscal sales had increased over the fiscal total of  the percentage of sales to retail customers for this segment was approximately during fiscal compared to and in fiscals and  respectively 
sales growth to retail customers over the last two years has been influenced by the continued strength of the frozen bread product lines 
further  although fiscal lacked the benefit of sales growth attributable to business acquisitions  the two acquisitions made during fiscal did contribute to fiscal growth 
these acquisitions provided approximately million in incremental sales volume during their first year of operations within the segment  including million in fiscal foodservice sales also increased through this period as a result of well received product development efforts for existing national account customers as well as sales to new national account customers 
however  this channel saw only modest growth in the latter half of fiscal due to generally soft consumer demand and a decrease in significant new account activity 
the specialty foods segment s operating income in fiscal totaled  a increase over the fiscal total of  the level was  or  above the fiscal level of  the increase in fiscal s operating income was principally driven by the benefits of higher sales volumes  changes in sales mix and lower trade promotional activities 
these influences were partially offset by higher ingredient costs  especially for soybean oil 
the impact of soybean oil costs is estimated to have exceeded million  and higher soybean oil costs are currently anticipated to continue to adversely affect comparative results through at least the first half of fiscal the impact of year over year variations in ingredient costs between fiscal and was not significant 
the higher income level in fiscal compared to fiscal largely resulted from the higher sales volumes partially offset by higher trade promotional costs and the presence of competitive foodservice pricing pressures 
segment review glassware and candles net sales of the glassware and candles segment are comprised primarily of candles and related accessories 
the segment s sales during fiscal totaled  and declined compared to fiscal net sales of  similarly  compared to net sales in fiscal totaling  fiscal sales declined by 
the sales decline in each year was primarily attributable to a year over year decline in candle sales made to mass merchants 
factors contributing to the decline in the sales of the segment s candles were an apparent overall softening in the consumer demand of candles within the mass market  heightened competition from imported product and a continuation of competitive market pricing conditions 
sales of glassware products also declined in the segment s industrial and floral channels 
the segment s operating income totaled  during fiscal  an increase over the prior year s total of  compared to fiscal operating income of  fiscal income declined by 
over the last two years  in addition to the effects of the lower volume and competitive pricing conditions  income was adversely affected by a less favorable sales mix and lower production levels leading to greater amounts of unabsorbed overhead in both candle and glassware manufacturing operations 
somewhat offsetting this impact has been the income associated with the liquidations of lifo glassware inventory acquired at substantially lower costs in prior years 
such liquidations reduced cost of sales by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal as discussed above  the million restructuring charge related to the consolidation of glass manufacturing operations also impacted fiscal results 
the january bankruptcy filing of kmart corporation affected the fiscal results 
in addition to recording a related bad debt provision of million during fiscal  the segment s sales to this customer were adversely affected by the impact of the reorganization process on kmart corporation s sales 
other issues negatively impacting fiscal results were expenses associated with a prolonged labor strike at a consumer glassware facility and unabsorbed costs associated with a scheduled rebuild of a glass melting tank 
many of the effects of the decline in sales volume will persist into fiscal  and we continue to assess how to most optimally utilize the capacity of this segment s manufacturing facilities 
segment review automotive net sales of the automotive segment during fiscal totaled  a increase over the prior year s sales level of  fiscal sales declined from the sales level of  achieved in fiscal consistent with the trend experienced in fiscal  the overall sales of aluminum truck accessories in fiscal increased as a result of new product lines being sold to original equipment manufacturers oems 
however  the unsettled economic conditions that began in fiscal continued to adversely impact the sales of many of the segment s other products  especially in the aftermarket 
additionally  certain floor mat product lines have been discontinued based on our analysis that an adequate contribution margin would not be provided in the future 
operating income of the automotive segment totaled  for fiscal  a increase over the prior year s total of  this increase was influenced by the greater sales level  the sales mix and better overhead absorption 
material costs  however  were trending up in the latter half of fiscal the substantial improvement in fiscal results above fiscal s operating income of  was primarily attributable to greater production efficiencies achieved within the floor mat operations  generally lower material costs  less need for inventory obsolescence provisions and higher capacity utilization occurring within the aluminum accessory operations 
price reductions occurred among certain oem programs and mitigated the extent to which operating income increased 
this segment s sales to oems are made both directly to the oems and indirectly through third party tier suppliers 
such sales are sensitive to the overall rate of new vehicle sales  the availability of competitive alternatives and the tier suppliers ongoing ability to maintain their relationship with the oems 
additionally  the extent of pricing flexibility associated with these sales continues to be particularly limited with certain products subject to annual price reductions 
during  sales to oems comprised of this segment s sales compared to and in and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the higher level of net income achieved in the year ended june  allowed us to further strengthen our already strong financial position  including again ending the year without debt 
we believe that this financial position provides us with substantial flexibility to acquire businesses complementary in function to that of our existing operations  evaluate share repurchase levels and otherwise meet ongoing liquidity requirements 
we maintain a revolving credit arrangement with several commercial banks totaling  terms of the related agreement allow for borrowings to occur at or below the us prime rate of interest 
we did not have any borrowings under this arrangement in fiscal and thus did not pay any interest in we believe that internally generated funds  the existing credit facilities and an ability to obtain additional financing  if desired  will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund future foreseeable capital needs 
our cash flows for the fiscal years through are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash flow generated from operations remains the primary source of financing for our internal growth 
cash provided from operating activities in fiscal totaled  a decrease from the prior year s total of  and increase over the fiscal total of  cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal benefited from the extent to which inventories declined 
among the components of working capital  accounts receivable at june  of  declined from year ago levels as affected by the lower fourth quarter sales 
the rising proportion of specialty food sales has also contributed to a lower level of consolidated accounts receivable  as such sales typically have shorter payment terms than do sales of our other two segments 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal included capital expenditures totaling  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal capital spending allocations during fiscal by segment were to specialty foods  to glassware and candles and to automotive 
expenditures in fiscal included an expansion to a frozen roll manufacturing facility of the specialty foods segment 
fiscal expenditures are currently expected to exceed that of fiscal due to construction starting on a new salad dressing facility that is not anticipated to be completed until fiscal during fiscals and  no business acquisitions were consummated although payments totaling  and  respectively  were made as required under the terms of a contingent payment arrangement associated with a business acquired in fiscal the single largest purpose of cash flows used in investing activities during fiscal was for business acquisitions 
two such acquisitions  both in the specialty foods segment  were made that required an initial fiscal aggregate expenditure of  net of cash acquired 
financing activities used net cash totaling   and  in fiscals  and respectively 
cash utilized for share repurchases totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
in may  our board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization of  shares of which approximately  remained authorized for future purchase as of june  total dividend payments for were  which was nearly greater than the total of  this increase reflects the higher dividend payout rate of 
present during as compared to 
during and 
in fiscal fiscal marks the th consecutive year in which our dividend rate was increased 
the future levels of share repurchases and declared dividends are subject to the periodic review of our board of directors and are generally determined after an assessment is made of such factors as anticipated earnings levels  cash flow requirements and general business conditions 
our ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws  rules and regulations as may be issued and enforced by various federal  state and local agencies 
with respect to environmental matters  costs are incurred pertaining to regulatory compliance and  upon occasion  remediation 
such costs have not been  and are not anticipated to become  material 
we are contingently liable with respect to lawsuits  taxes and various other matters that routinely arise in the normal course of business 
we do not have any related party transactions that materially affect our results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operation  liquidity or capital expenditures 
impact of inflation raw material costs during fiscal were above fiscal levels  particularly in the latter half of fiscal among commodities most affecting this increase were soybean oil in the specialty foods segment and certain petroleum derived materials used in the automotive segment 
energy costs in fiscal were also above year ago levels after having abated from record high levels incurred in fiscal we generally attempt to adjust our selling prices to offset the effects of increased raw material costs 
however  these adjustments have historically been difficult to implement 
if implemented  such adjustments tend to lag the increase in costs incurred 
minimizing the exposure to such increased costs is our diversity of operations and our ongoing efforts to achieve greater manufacturing and distribution efficiencies through the improvement of work processes 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  marketing and distribution costs  asset impairments and self insurance reserves 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  the aggregate differences  if any  between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
while a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in part ii  item of this form k  we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition customer sales are recognized when revenue is realized and earned 
we recognize revenue when the risk and title passes to the customer  generally at the time of shipment 
customer sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated returns  trade promotions and other discounts  which are recognized as a deduction from sales at the time of sale 
receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts receivable balances and historical write off experience and on going reviews of our trade receivables 
measurement of potential losses requires credit review of existing customer relationships  consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the economic health of customers 
in addition to credit concerns  we also evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for customer deductions considering several factors including historical losses and existing customer relationships 
valuation of inventory when necessary  we provide allowances to adjust the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value  including any costs to sell or dispose 
the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving  obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates about the future demand for our products 
the estimates as to future demand used in the valuation of inventory are subject to the ongoing success of our products 
in addition  our allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the number of stock keeping units 
a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes  consumer buying patterns or loss of shelf space to competitors could significantly impact our evaluation of our excess and obsolete inventories 
the valuation during interim periods of inventories determined under the lifo method of accounting requires estimations regarding the year end mix of inventory quantities and costs of product 
such estimates may differ from the actual due to such factors as changes in customer demand and production schedules 
accrued marketing and distribution various marketing programs are offered to customers to reimburse them for a portion or all of their promotional activities related to our products 
additionally  we often incur various costs associated with shipping products to the customer 
we provide accruals for the costs of marketing and distribution based on historical information as may be modified by estimates of actual costs incurred 
actual costs may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the customers programs  changes in customer utilization practices  or other conditions differ from expectations 
accruals for self insurance self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with employee health care  workers compensation and general liability insurance 
these accruals include estimates that may be based on historical loss development factors 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
accounting for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to determine our ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans  we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works 
to record the related net assets and obligation of such benefit plans  we use assumptions related to inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
these assumptions follow the guidance provided in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
we  along with third party actuaries  review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on pension expense and related funding requirements

 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  to expand upon and strengthen existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity
