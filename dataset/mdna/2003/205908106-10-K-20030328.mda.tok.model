additional oral or written forward looking statements may be made by the company from time to time  and such statements may be included in documents that are filed with the securities and exchange commission sec

among the important factors on which such statements are based are assumptions concerning the anticipated growth of the information technology industry  the continued need of current and prospective customers for the company s services  the availability of qualified professional staff  and price and wage inflation 
revenue generating activities and critical accounting policies revenue generating activities the majority of the company s revenues are derived from professional services rendered in the information technology sector

the company operates its business in three basic segments  it services  the solutions group and chimes  inc the distinctions between the it services and solutions group segments primarily relate to the management and supervision of services performed and related gross margins 
chimes  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of chc  provides workforce procurement and management services to global companies 
the it services business consists of providing technology consultants to large organizations on a temporary hire basis 
the consultant work is supervised and managed by the customer 
for the most recent year  this segment represented approximately of total revenues 
the it services business tends to be a lower risk  lower gross margin business with very competitive pricing 
the solutions group  tends to be a higher margin  higher risk business  due to the fact that the company is responsible for project deliverables and other conditions contained in statements of work and or contracts with customers 
virtually all projects performed by the solutions group are it related and consist of practices such as application development  outsourcing arrangements  governments services  health insurance portability and accountability act  or hipaa  services  technology training and managed services 
for the year  the solutions group accounted for of consolidated revenue 
chimes  inc is a human capital management solution that  through the use of proprietary software and processes  manages the temporary workforce of large organizations 
during  chimes accounted for approximately of total revenues 
critical accounting policies the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements are related to revenue recognition  the evaluation of long lived assets for impairment and the evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
revenue recognition the revenue for the it services group is recognized as services are rendered 
hourly or daily rates are determined in advance and agreed to with the customer 
time worked is documented in various forms using the applicable timekeeping process ie the client s or the company s timekeeping systems 
revenues in the solutions group are also recognized as services are performed  however  adjustments are sometimes needed to reflect progress against milestones or deliverables 
on fixed fee engagements  revenue and gross profit adjustments are made to reflect revisions in estimated costs and contract values 
approximately and of total revenue in and  respectively  was generated under fixed fee contracts 
the company s chimes subsidiary recognizes revenue on a net transaction fee basis 
chimes recognizes only their fee for the service  not the aggregate billing to the customer 
the chimes solution aggregates the temporary workforce supply chain to the customer and renders one invoice to the customer 
chimes is paid for this service by the supply chain in the form of a fee 
the gross amount of the customer invoicing is not considered revenue to chimes because there is no earnings process for the gross amount and by contract terms  chimes is not obligated to pay the supply chain until paid by the customer 
princeton recognized revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and aicpa statement of position sop 
under sop  the company recognized software license revenue when a noncancelable license agreement had been executed  fees were fixed and determinable  the software had been delivered  and collection was considered probable 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of up to and including the year ended december   the company evaluated its long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of such assets or intangibles may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used was measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such an asset was considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized was measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeded the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of were reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less costs to sell 
at the end of  the company made certain strategic decisions to realign businesses and declared certain assets for sale or disposition 
these decisions resulted in the application of the above mentioned policy and the recording of million of non cash charges in for related write offs 
as of december   all assets previously declared for sale were disposed of 
effective on january   the company adopted financial accounting standard no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
this supercedes sfas  while retaining many of the requirements of such statement 
the effect of this statement is immaterial to the company 
goodwill and other intangible assets in june  the financial accounting standards board approved the issuance of sfas no 
 business combinations and in july  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the new standards require that all business combinations initiated after june  must be accounted for under the purchase method 
in addition  all intangible assets acquired that are obtained through contractual or legal right  or are capable of being separately sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged shall be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives will no longer be subject to amortization  but will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the company adopted sfas as of january  and in compliance with this new regulation has discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
during the quarter ended june   the company completed the initial valuation of the carrying value of goodwill existing at january  as a result  a non cash charge of million  or per share was retroactively recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the six months ended june  statement of operations 
for the year ended december  the company completed a second valuation of the carrying value of the remaining goodwill and it was determined that no further impairment had occurred 
the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended december   are as follows in s reporting units solutions it services education chimes consolidated balance as of december     addition to goodwill impairment losses   balance as of december    the reporting units are equal to  or one level below  reportable segments 
the company engaged independent valuation consultants to assist with the transitional goodwill impairment tests 
the fair value of each of the reporting units was calculated using the following approaches i market approach and ii income approach 
under the market approach  value is estimated by comparing the performance fundamentals relating to similar public companies stock prices 
multiples are then developed of the value of the publicly traded stock to various measures and are then applied to each reporting unit to estimate the value of its equity 
under the income approach  value was determined using the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit 
the fair value conclusion of the reporting units reflects an equally blended value of the market multiple approach and the income approach discussed above 
as a result of performing steps one and two of the goodwill impairment test  a loss of million was recognized and recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
there was no income tax effect on the impairment charge as approximately million of the charge related to goodwill in foreign tax jurisdictions where the company believes it is more likely than not that future taxable income in these jurisdictions will not be sufficient to realize the related income tax benefits associated with the charge 
the remaining million of the charge was related primarily to goodwill that was acquired prior to the ability to deduct goodwill for tax purposes
