item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations universal compression holdings  inc 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  and the notes thereto  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
see part i 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
general since holdings initial public offering in  we have completed several acquisitions 
our completed acquisitions include gas compression services  inc gcsi in september  weatherford global compression services  lp and certain related entities weatherford global in exchange for  shares of our stock and iss compression iew in february  compressor system international  inc csii in april  kci  inc kci and louisiana compressor maintenance lcm in july  and technical compression service  inc tcsi in october gcsi added approximately  horsepower to our fleet and provided us with an increased customer base  additional market segments and additional fabrication capabilities 
weatherford global added approximately  horsepower  which expanded both our domestic and international presence and more than doubled our size at the time 
iew added approximately  horsepower to our fleet  as well as important offshore gulf of mexico service capabilities 
csii added approximately  horsepower in the aggregate to our fleet in mexico and argentina 
kci added approximately  horsepower to our domestic fleet as well as significant fabrication expertise and capabilities  and expertise in the pipeline compression and related natural gas markets 
lcm added to our ability to be a supplier of maintenance  repair  and overhaul and upgrade services to natural gas pipeline and related markets 
tcsi added to our compression parts and service capabilities for the natural gas producing industry as well as the refinery and petrochemical industries 
we are a holding company and  as such  derive all of our operating income from our operating subsidiary  universal 
we do not have any significant assets other than the stock of our operating subsidiaries 
consequently  we are dependent on the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that are not legally obligated to make funds available to us  and in some cases may be contractually restricted from doing so 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepare these financial statements in conformity with gaap 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the accounting policies we believe require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position are as follows allowances and reserves our customers are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of credit 
we maintain an allowance for bad debts based on specific customer collection issues and historical experience 
on an ongoing basis  we conduct an evaluation of the financial strength of our customers based on payment history and make adjustments to the allowance as necessary 
since most of our customers are in the energy industry  their ability to pay balances due could be affected by dramatic changes in the price and demand for their products 
we record a reserve against our inventory balance for estimated obsolescence 
this reserve is based on specific identification and historical experience 
depreciation property  plant and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation for financial reporting purposes is computed on the straight line basis using estimated useful lives 
for compression equipment  depreciation begins with the first compression service using a salvage value 
the estimated useful lives prior to january  for compression equipment was years and for other properties and equipment from to years 
the company evaluated the estimated useful life used for book depreciation purposes for its compressor fleet with the assistance of an independent equipment valuation firm 
this equipment study evaluated the compressor units based upon equipment type  key components and industry experience of the actual useful life in the field 
the study was finalized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based upon the findings of the study  the estimated useful lives of the majority of the existing compressor units were extended to years from years 
in addition  a portion of the units remained at years or less and a portion of the units were extended to years 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for all our business segments using the following criteria a persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the buyer s price is fixed or determinable and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from contract compression is recorded when earned over the period of the contract  which generally ranges from one month to several years 
fabrication revenue is recognized using the completed contract method  specifically when all terms of the contract have been completed and title to the product has been transferred 
aftermarket services revenue is recorded as products are delivered and services are rendered 
business combinations and goodwill goodwill and intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations represent the excess of consideration over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as in determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill 
we perform an impairment test for goodwill assets annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
our goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units with their carrying value 
the fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and other market related valuation models 
certain estimates and judgments are required in the application of the fair value models 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we performed an impairment analysis in accordance with sfas no 
and determined that no impairment had occurred  however  if for any reason the fair value of our goodwill or that of any of our reporting units declines below the carrying value in the future  we may incur charges for the impairment 
long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment  definite lived intangibles and other assets comprise a significant amount of our total assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used by us are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets to be held and used  we base our evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  we determine whether an impairment has occurred through the use of undiscounted cash flows analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
if an impairment has occurred  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  is based on an estimate of discounted cash flows 
self insurance we are self insured up to certain levels for general liability  vehicle liability  group medical and for workers compensation claims for certain of our employees 
we record self insurance accruals based on claims filed and an estimate for significant claims incurred but not reported 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through insurance reserves 
although we believe adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  it is reasonably possible our estimates of these liabilities will change over the near term as circumstances develop 
income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events are considered other than enactments of changes in the tax law or rates 
we provide contract compression services to a global market 
as such  we are subject to taxation not only in the united states but also in numerous foreign jurisdictions 
having to consider these different jurisdictions complicates the estimate of future taxable income  which in turn determines the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including assumptions on future operating conditions and asset utilization 
the judgments and assumptions used to determine future taxable income are consistent with those used for other financial statement purposes 
additionally  we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would minimize the amount of deferred tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets 
the principal tax planning strategy available to us relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
the assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the foreign earnings are analyzed and reviewed annually for changes in our international and domestic business outlook

depreciation and amortization increased by million to million during the fiscal year ended march   compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  depreciation expense increased due to a full twelve months of depreciation of fiscal capital additions and capitalized overhauls 
in addition  depreciation expense increased due to the three months of depreciation of gas compressor units that were not previously recorded on our balance sheet until december   when the lessors under the operating lease facilities became fully consolidated entities 
depreciation expense related to these assets began january  and increased depreciation expense for the fiscal year ended march  by approximately million

ebitda  as adjusted  is defined and reconciled to net income in item of this report  selected financial data  under the caption selected historical financial data universal compression holdings  inc non recurring charges 
during the fiscal year ended march   we incurred non recurring charges of million related to the early termination of a management agreement and a consulting agreement and other related fees in connection with our initial public offering and concurrent financing transactions as well as costs related to facilities and workforce reductions associated with our weatherford global acquisition 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million during the fiscal year ended march   compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase was primarily due to capital additions of million  which primarily resulted from expansion of our contract compression fleet  through our fabrication operations and the purchase of approximately million and million of contract compression equipment from the acquisitions of kci and csii  respectively 
the increase in depreciation and amortization was partially offset by the net sales and leasebacks of compressor equipment  with a book value of approximately million  between april and october under our operating lease facilities 
operating lease expense 
operating lease expense increased to million during the fiscal year ended march  resulting from the increase in compression equipment leased under our operating lease facilities 
the outstanding balance under the operating lease facilities at march  was million 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  remained fairly constant at million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily as a result of the repayment of the million revenue bonds  offset partially by increased accretion of universal s senior discount notes

during the fiscal year ended march   we incurred extraordinary losses of million million net of income tax related to debt restructurings that occurred concurrently with our initial public offering and the weatherford global acquisition 
net income loss 
we had net income of million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to a net loss of million including extraordinary loss of million net of income taxes for the fiscal year ended march   for the reasons noted above 
effects of inflation in recent years  inflation has been modest and has not had a material impact upon the results of our operations 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance at march  was million  compared to million at march  our principal sources of cash were operating activities which provided million and sales of property  plant and equipment which provided million 
principal uses of cash during the fiscal year ended were capital expenditures of million  repayments of debt of approximately million and debt issuance costs of million 
working capital  net of cash  was million at march  and decreased from million at march  primarily due to our continual focus on cash management and on the acceleration of collections of accounts receivable 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended march  were million consisting of million for growth projects  million for compressor overhauls  million for a new office facility and million for vehicles and information technology equipment 
on december   we purchased all of the equity in the lessor under our seven year term senior secured notes operating lease facility the high yield operating lease facility 
due to this equity investment  the lessor became our fully consolidated entity as of december  and the debt related to the high yield lease facility has been included in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  as of march   the aggregate principal amounts outstanding under the high yield operating lease facility were million of senior secured notes due february  and million under a term loan due february  also on december   and concurrently with the obtaining of credit ratings by standard poor s and moody s investors service on our million asset backed securitization operating lease facility the abs operating lease facility  the equity of the lessor under this facility was reduced 
as a result of the reduction  the lessor became our fully consolidated entity as of december  and the debt related to the abs operating lease facility was included in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  as of march   the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the abs operating lease facility was million 
as a result of the changes in the high yield and abs operating lease facilities and consistent with the purchase accounting rules set forth in sfas no 
 business combinations  we recorded in our consolidated balance sheet approximately million of contract compression equipment  approximately million in long term debt and a noncurrent liability of approximately million related to interest rate swaps pertaining to the abs operating lease facility 
additionally  upon consolidation of the lessors of these operating lease facilities  the previously recorded deferred gain of million was eliminated 
due to the changes in the high yield and abs operating lease facilities discussed above  which resulted in the related party s debt being included in the consolidated balance sheet  the future minimum lease payments under the operating lease facilities were eliminated 
we hold interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates related to the million abs operating lease facility 
at march   the fair market value of these interest rate swaps was a liability of approximately million  which was recorded as a noncurrent liability 
the interest rate swaps terminate in february the weighted average fixed rate of these swaps is 
on may   universal commenced a tender offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding million aggregate principal amount of its senior discount notes due at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus a premium of for notes tendered prior to the early expiration date for the tender offer  which was may  of the million aggregate principal amount of senior discount notes outstanding  million principal amount was tendered prior to the early expiration date 
on may   universal completed a private offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due universal used the net proceeds of the new senior notes offering  together with cash on hand  to pay the purchase price  including the premium  plus accrued and unpaid interest  for the senior discount notes purchased pursuant to the tender offer 
on may   pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the senior discount notes  universal called for redemption the remaining million principal amount of senior discount notes outstanding 
the redemption price will be equal to of the principal amount of the senior discount notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to  but not including  the redemption date 
the closing of the redemption is scheduled for june  and will be funded with available cash and additional borrowings under universal s revolving credit facility 
as a result of the tender offer and the redemption  universal expects to retire all of the outstanding senior discount notes 
as of june   after giving effect to the closing of the redemption expected to occur on june   and to the covenants in our financing instruments  we expect to have unused credit availability under our existing financial instruments of approximately million 
our ability to repatriate cash may be limited from time to time by certain statutory banking restrictions that can be imposed by various international regulatory agencies 
we believe that funds generated from our operations  together with our existing cash and the additional capacity available under our revolving credit facility and the abs operating lease facility  are sufficient to finance our current operations  planned capital expenditures and internal growth for fiscal year if we were to make significant additional acquisitions for cash  we might need to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of and also broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented

seasonal fluctuations our results of operations have not historically reflected any material seasonal tendencies 
risk factors as described in part i 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements  this report contains forward looking statements regarding us  our business and our industry 
the risk factors described below  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
additional risks not currently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect us 
our international operations subject us to risks that are difficult to predict 
for the year ended march   we derived approximately of our revenues from international operations 
we intend to continue to expand our business in latin america  and asia pacific and  ultimately  other international markets 
this may make it more difficult for us to manage our business 
reasons for this include  but are not limited to  the following political and economic instability in foreign markets  foreign governments restrictive trade policies  inconsistent product regulation or sudden policy changes by foreign agencies or governments  the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws  the imposition of duties  taxes or government royalties  foreign exchange rate risks  difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable  potentially longer payment cycles  increased costs in maintaining international manufacturing and marketing efforts  the introduction of non tariff barriers and higher duty rates  difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations  restrictions on repatriation of earnings or expropriation of property  and the geographic  time zone  language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world 
any of these factors could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
historically  our foreign operations  including assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  have been denominated in various currencies other than the us dollar  and we expect that our foreign operations will continue to be so denominated 
as a result  the us dollar value of our foreign operations has varied  and will continue to vary  with exchange rate fluctuations 
in this respect  historically we have been primarily exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the argentine peso  brazilian real  thai baht  mexican peso  australian dollar and canadian dollar against the us dollar 
a decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the us dollar could reduce our profits from foreign operations and the value of the net assets of our foreign operations when reported in us dollars in our financial statements 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations as reported in us dollars 
in addition  fluctuations in exchange rates relative to currencies in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period to period comparisons of our reported results of operations 
for purposes of accounting  the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations  where the local currency is the functional currency  are translated using period end exchange rates  and the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated using average exchange rates during each period 
although we attempt to match costs and revenues in local currencies  we anticipate that there may be instances in which costs and revenues will not be matched with respect to currency denomination 
as a result  to the extent we continue our expansion on a global basis  we expect that increasing portions of our revenues  costs  assets and liabilities will be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency valuations 
we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
further  the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local or foreign currency  resulting in our inability to hedge against these risks 
weatherford s voting power may give it the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
currently  weatherford international ltd 
weatherford owns  shares  or approximately  of our outstanding common stock 
in addition to its voting power  weatherford and its affiliates are entitled to designate three persons to serve on our board of directors for so long as they own at least of our outstanding common stock 
if weatherford s ownership falls below  weatherford may designate only two directors 
if weatherford s ownership falls below  it will no longer have the right to designate directors to our board 
this significant stock ownership and board representation gives weatherford the ability to exercise substantial influence over our ownership  policies  management and affairs and significant control over actions requiring approval of our stockholders 
weatherford s interests could conflict with our other stockholders 
see item certain relationships and related transactions for further information regarding our relationship with weatherford 
sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock  particularly as our common stock is thinly traded 
the shares owned by weatherford are subject to registration rights and may be resold at any time 
the sale of a substantial number of shares within a short period of time could cause our stock price to decrease  making it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our common stock and to acquire businesses using our stock as consideration 
we are dependent on particular suppliers and are vulnerable to product shortages and price increases 
as a consequence of having a highly standardized contract compression fleet  some of the components used in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on these suppliers involves several risks  including price increases  inferior component quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner 
the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have at least a temporary material adverse effect on our results of operations and could damage our customer relationships 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our ability to manage our business effectively will be weakened if we lose key personnel 
we depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
the departure of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we do not maintain key man life insurance coverage with respect to our executive officers or key management personnel 
we are not aware of the upcoming retirement of any of our executive officers or senior management personnel 
in addition  we believe that our success depends on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
if we fail to recruit other skilled personnel  we could be unable to compete effectively 
we may not be successful in implementing our business strategy  which may adversely affect our ability to finance our future growth 
our ability to implement our business strategy successfully depends upon a number of factors including competition  availability of working capital and general economic conditions 
significant elements of our business strategy include growth of our market share and broader participation in the international market for compression services 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in implementing our strategy or be able to obtain financing for this strategy on acceptable terms 
the indenture governing our senior notes  our revolving credit facility and our lease facilities substantially limit our ability to incur additional debt to finance our growth strategy 
see business growth strategy 
we do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities 
natural gas service operations are subject to inherent risks such as equipment defects  malfunction and failures  and natural disasters that can result in uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids  fires and explosions 
these risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury  death  property damage  pollution and other environmental damages 
although we have obtained insurance against many of these risks  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to cover our liabilities 
further  insurance covering the risks we face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or  if available  the premiums may not be commercially justifiable 
if we were to incur substantial liability and the damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits  or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we intend to continue to make substantial capital investments to implement our business strategy  which may reduce funds available for other operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to make substantial capital investments to expand and maintain our contract compression fleet 
for the year ended march   we invested approximately million in capital investments  excluding acquisitions 
we expect to spend between and million on capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  during fiscal year  approximately million of which would be used for maintenance capital expenditures 
historically  we have financed these investments through internally generated funds  debt offerings  our revolving credit facility and our lease facilities 
these significant capital investments require cash that we could otherwise apply to other business needs 
however  if we do not incur these expenditures while our competitors make substantial fleet investments  our market share may decline and our business may be adversely affected 
in addition  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash internally or obtain alternative sources of capital to fund our proposed capital expenditures  it could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and growth 
we are subject to substantial environmental regulation  and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities 
we are subject to stringent and complex foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulatory standards  including laws and regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment  emission controls and other environmental protection and occupational health and safety concerns 
see business environmental and other regulations 
environmental laws and regulations may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering us liable for remediation costs  natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of  or conditions caused by  prior owners or operators or other third parties 
in addition  where contamination may be present  it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury  property damage and recovery of response costs 
remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations  and costs associated with new information  changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
we routinely deal with natural gas  oil and other petroleum products 
as a result of our fabrication and aftermarket services operations  we generate  manage and dispose of or recycle hazardous wastes and substances such as solvents  thinner  waste paint  waste oil  washdown wastes and sandblast material 
although it is our policy to use generally accepted operating and disposal practices in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on  under or from properties owned  leased or operated by us or on or under other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal 
these properties may be subject to investigatory  remediation and monitoring requirements under foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
nevertheless  the modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations  the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations  or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us and other similarly situated service companies 
we face significant competition that may cause us to lose market share and harm our financial performance 
the contract compression  fabrication and aftermarket services businesses are highly competitive 
some of our competitors also offer a wide range of compressors for sale or lease  and there are low barriers to entry for individual projects 
in addition  we compete with several large national and multinational companies  most of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
if our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive products and services  we may not be able to compete effectively 
most of our domestic compressor leases have short initial terms  and we may not recoup the costs of our investment if we are unable to subsequently re lease the compressors 
in most cases  the initial terms of our contract compression leases with customers are short  with the most common initial term being six months and continuing on a month to month basis thereafter 
the initial terms of our leases are generally too short to enable us to recoup the average cost of acquiring or fabricating compressors for contract compression customers under prevailing contract compression and lease rates 
as a result  we assume substantial risk of not recovering our entire investment in the equipment we acquire or fabricate for contract compression customers 
although we historically have been successful in subsequently re leasing our compressors  we may not be able to continue to do so and a substantial number of our contract compression customers could terminate their leases at approximately the same time 
if such an event were to occur  even if we are successful in re leasing our compressors as we have been in the past  we may not be able to obtain favorable contract compression rates 
this would have an adverse effect on our revenues and cash flow 
we depend on strong demand for natural gas and a prolonged  substantial reduction in this demand could adversely affect the demand for our services and products 
gas contract compression operations are significantly dependent upon the demand for natural gas 
demand may be affected by  among other factors  natural gas prices  weather  demand for energy and availability of alternative energy sources 
any prolonged  substantial reduction in the demand for natural gas would  in all likelihood  depress the level of production  exploration and development activity and result in a decline in the demand for our contract compression services and products 
similarly  a decrease in capital spending by our customers could result in reduced demand for our fabrication and aftermarket services businesses 
these events could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
future terrorist attacks or responses thereto could adversely affect us 
the impact that future events arising as a result of the terrorist attacks on the united states on september   or any terrorist attacks that may occur in the future  including military or police activities in the united states  iraq or other foreign countries  future terrorist activities or threats of such activities  political unrest and instability  riots and protests  could have on the united states economy  the global economy  global financial markets and our business cannot currently be determined with any accuracy 
we are highly leveraged  a significant portion of our cash flow must be used to service our obligations and we are vulnerable to interest rate increases 
we have now and will continue to have a significant amount of debt 
as of march   we had approximately million in outstanding obligations  of which approximately million was outstanding under our abs lease facility  approximately million was outstanding under our brl lease facility and million was outstanding under our senior discount notes 
this amount excludes approximately million of letters of credit issued under our million senior secured revolving credit facility  which we refer to as our revolving credit facility 
our high level of debt could have important consequences to you  including the following require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay our debt and lease payments  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  operations  expansion of our fleet and other business activities  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our senior notes  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit  along with financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments  our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities  limit our ability to make capital expenditures to maintain our facilities and compressor fleet in good working order and repair  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
approximately million of our outstanding debt bears interest at floating rates 
changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates  thereby increasing our interest expense and reducing our funds available to make payments of interest and principal on the notes and for capital investment  operations or other purposes 
our significant leverage increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
we will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt  including our credit facilities  lease facilities  or the senior notes  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition to our current indebtedness  we may incur substantially more debt 
this could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial debt 
we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the substantial risks described above would intensify 
our credit facilities and lease facilities impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
our credit facilities and lease facilities include certain covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to borrow money  create liens  other than a lien securing the revolving credit facility  the brl lease facility or the abs lease facility  sell or transfer any of our material property  merge into or consolidate with any third party or sell or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  and make capital expenditures 
we and our subsidiaries are also required by our credit facilities to maintain debt coverage ratios  interest coverage ratios and a specified tangible net worth 
all of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies 
our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the indentures and the credit facilities may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance  changes in business conditions or results of operation  adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our debt  which could cause those obligations to become due and payable 
if any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that we would be able to repay it 
any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations  we may be forced to sell assets  seek additional equity or debt capital  or restructure our debt 
our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient for payment of interest on and principal of our debt in the future and any alternative measures may be unsuccessful or may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations  which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity 
the market price of our common stock is volatile 
historically  the market price of common stock of companies engaged in the natural gas industry has been highly volatile 
similarly  the market price of our common stock has varied significantly since our initial public offering in may in particular  changes in natural gas prices or in the demand for natural gas could affect the price of our common stock 
we are a holding company and rely on our subsidiaries for operating income 
we are a holding company and  as such  derive all of our operating income from our operating subsidiary  universal  and its subsidiaries 
we do not have any significant assets other than the stock of our operating subsidiary 
consequently  we are dependent on the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that are not legally obligated to make funds available to us  and in some cases may be contractually restricted from doing so 
we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be able to  or be permitted to  pay to us amounts necessary to meet our obligations 
a third party could be prevented from acquiring control of us because of the anti takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws 
there are provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change in control would result in the purchase of your shares at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to you 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock  it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  such as a staggered board of directors and limitations on the removal of directors  no stockholder action by written consent and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
delaware corporation law may also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by our board of directors 
we do not expect to pay dividends 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the ability of universal to pay dividends is restricted by the revolving credit facility  the lease facilities  the indentures governing our senior notes and other financing arrangements

depreciation and amortization increased by million to million during the fiscal year ended march   compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  depreciation expense increased due to a full twelve months of depreciation of fiscal capital additions and capitalized overhauls 
in addition  depreciation expense increased due to the three months of depreciation of gas compressor units that were not previously recorded on universal s balance sheet until december   when the lessors under the operating lease facilities became fully consolidated entities 
depreciation expense related to these assets began january  and increased depreciation expense for the fiscal year ended march  by approximately million 
in fiscal  universal evaluated the estimated useful lives used for book depreciation purposes for its compressor fleet with the assistance of an independent equipment valuation firm 
this equipment study evaluated the compressor units based upon equipment type  key components and industry experience of the actual useful life in the field 
the study was finalized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based upon the findings of the study  the estimated useful lives of the majority of the existing compressor units were extended to years from years 
in addition  a portion of the units remained at the previous years or less and a portion of the units were extended to years 
the change in useful lives was effective january  the impact from extending the estimated useful lives of the equipment that was recorded on universal s balance sheet on december  excluding the gas compression equipment related to the operating lease facilities reduced depreciation expense by approximately million for the year ended march  the combined impact as a result of the consolidation of the compressor equipment in the operating lease facilities and the extension of the estimated useful lives was an increase to depreciation expense of approximately million and a decrease to net income of million for the year ended march  operating lease expense 
operating lease expense decreased to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  operating lease expense related to the operating lease facilities has been recognized as interest expense subsequent to the consolidation of the lease facilities on december  as a result  universal recognized no operating lease expense for the quarter ended march  interest expense  net

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to some market risk due to the floating or variable interest rates under our financing arrangements 
a portion of the interest and lease payments under our financing arrangements are based on a floating rate a base rate or libor  at our option  in the case of our revolving credit facility  and libor  in the case of our operating lease facilities plus a variable amount based on our operating results 
the one month libor rate at june  was 
a increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  annual increase in our interest expense 
as of march   approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness and other obligations outstanding bears interest at floating rates 
we hold interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates related to the million abs operating lease facility 
at march   the fair market value of these interest rate swaps was a liability of approximately million  which was recorded as a noncurrent liability 
the interest rate swaps terminate in february the weighted average fixed rate of these swaps is 
to minimize any significant foreign currency credit risk  we generally contractually require that payment by our customers be made in us dollars 
if payment is not made in us dollars  we generally utilize the exchange rate into us dollars on the payment date or balance payments in local currency against local expenses
