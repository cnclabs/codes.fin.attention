item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
statements in the following discussion may be forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s financial results are most directly affected by changing prices for its production 
changing prices can influence not only current results of operations but the determination of the company s proved reserves and available sources of financing  including the determination of the borrowing base under its bank credit facility 
the company s results depend not only on hydrocarbon prices generally  but on its ability to market its production on favorable terms in the areas in which it is produced  including foreign areas such as thailand where the company s operations may be subject to local constraints on demand  currency restrictions  exchange rate fluctuations  the possibility of increases in taxes or other charges and non renewal or other adverse action relating to concessions or contracts  and other political risks 
on a longer term basis the company s financial condition and results of operations are affected by its ability to replace reserves as they are produced through successful exploration  development and acquisition activity 
the company s results could also be adversely affected by adverse regulatory developments and operational risks associated with oil and gas operations 
some of the other risks and uncertainties that may affect the company s results are mentioned in the discussion that follows 
on march   the merger of pogo producing company the company and noric corporation noric was consummated 
as a result of the merger  the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of north central oil corporation north central  an independent domestic oil and gas exploration and production company  which was the principal asset of noric 
the merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
commencing march   the results of north central s operations are consolidated with the company s 
pursuant to the merger agreement among the company  noric and certain noric shareholders dated as of november   former shareholders of noric received  shares of the company s common stock and approximately  in cash 
in addition  at closing the company repaid all  principal amount of north central s existing bank debt 
the sources of funds used in connection with the merger included cash on hand at the company and noric and borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
pogo trust i  a subsidiary of the company  called its cumulative quarterly income convertible preferred securities due the trust preferred securities for redemption on june  prior to their redemption  holders of  of the  outstanding trust preferred securities converted their trust preferred securities  representing over  face value of trust preferred securities  into  shares of the company s common stock 
in connection with the redemption  pogo trust i paid a total of  to former holders of the trust preferred securities 
subsequent to june   there were no trust preferred securities outstanding 
application of critical accounting policies and management s estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this form k 
we have identified below policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes  derivatives  contingencies and litigation  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements successful efforts method of accounting the company accounts for its oil and gas exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
interest costs related to financing major oil and gas projects in progress are capitalized until the projects are evaluated or until the projects are substantially complete and ready for their intended use if the projects are evaluated as successful 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but such costs are charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
in most cases  a gain or loss is recognized for sales of producing properties 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires management s judgment to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory  which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze  and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and application of industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
on occasion  wells are drilled which have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature  and in such instances an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
delineation seismic costs incurred to select development locations within a productive oil and gas field are typically treated as development costs and capitalized  but often these seismic programs extend beyond the proved reserve areas and therefore management must estimate the portion of seismic costs to expense as exploratory 
the evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires management s judgment to estimate the fair value of exploratory costs related to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when the company enters a new exploratory area in hopes of finding oil and gas reserves 
seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and the associated costs will be expensed as dry hole costs 
reserve estimates the company s estimates of oil and gas reserves are  by necessity  projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of expected oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
impairment of oil and gas properties the company reviews its proved oil and gas properties for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events and circumstances indicate a potential decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
the company estimates the expected future cash flows from its proved oil and gas properties and compares these future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to its fair value in the current period 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if there has been impairment of the carrying value  with any such impairment charged to expense in the period 
the company recognized significant impairment expense due to poor reservoir performance at one of its gulf of mexico properties in the first quarter of  and has recognized other less significant impairment expenses related to other properties in subsequent periods 
given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets  events may arise that will require the company to record an impairment of its oil and gas properties and there can be no assurance that such impairments will not be required in the future 
fair values of derivative instruments the estimated fair values of the company s derivative instruments are recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
historically  substantially all of the company s derivative instruments represent cash flow hedges of the price of future oil and natural gas production 
therefore  while fair values of such hedging instruments must be estimated at the end of each reporting period  the related changes in such fair values are not included in the company s consolidated results of operations  to the extent they are expected to offset the future cash flows from oil and natural gas production 
instead  the changes in fair value of hedging instruments are recorded directly to shareholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
the estimation of fair values for the company s hedging derivatives requires substantial judgment 
the company estimates the fair values of its derivatives on a monthly basis using an option pricing model 
to utilize the option pricing model  the company uses various factors that include closing exchange prices on the nymex  over the counter quotations  volatility and the time value of options 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements  and the resulting estimated future cash inflows outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted using the company s current borrowing rates under its revolving credit facility 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts  regional price differentials and interest rates 
currently  all of the company s derivative instruments are hedges of the price of crude oil and natural gas production 
the company is not involved in any derivative trading activities 
business combinations acquisitions the company grew substantially in through the acquisition of north central 
as stated earlier  this acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and subsequent accounting pronouncements require that all future acquisitions be accounted for using the purchase method 
under the purchase method  the acquiring company adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired company s assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
as of january   the accounting for goodwill has changed 
in prior years  goodwill was amortized 
effective january   goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite useful life are no longer amortized  but instead are assessed for impairment at least annually 
the company has never recorded any goodwill in connection with the acquisition of any assets 
however  there can be no assurance that the company may not do so in the future 
there are various assumptions made by the company in determining the fair values of an acquired company s assets and liabilities 
the most significant assumptions  and the ones requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired 
to determine the fair values of these properties  the company prepares estimates of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquid ngl reserves 
these estimates are based on work performed by the company s engineers and outside petroleum reservoir consultants 
the judgments associated with the estimation of reserves are described earlier in this section 
the fair value of the estimated reserves acquired in a business combination is then calculated based on the company s estimates of future oil  natural gas and ngl prices 
the company s estimates of future prices are based on its own analysis of pricing trends 
these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics  such as economic growth forecasts 
they are also based on industry data regarding natural gas storage availability  drilling rig activity  changes in delivery capacity and trends in regional pricing differentials 
future price forecasts from independent third parties are also taken into account in arriving at the company s own pricing estimates 
the company s estimates of future prices are applied to the estimated reserve quantities acquired to arrive at estimated future net revenues 
for estimated proved reserves  the future net revenues are then discounted to derive a fair value for such reserves 
the company also applies these same general principles in arriving at the fair value of unproved reserves acquired in a business combination 
these unproved reserves are generally classified as either probable or possible reserves 
because of their very nature  probable and possible reserve estimates are less precise than those of proved reserves 
generally  in the company s business combinations  the determination of the fair values of oil and gas properties requires more judgment than the estimates of fair values for other acquired assets and liabilities 
future development and abandonment costs future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves  including drilling costs and the installation of production equipment 
future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  fpsos  fsos  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
the accounting for future development and abandonment costs changed on january   with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
see liquidity and capital resources recent accounting pronouncements for a further discussion of this accounting standard 
pension and other post retirement benefits accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves several assumptions including the expected rates of return on plan assets  determination of discount rates for remeasuring plan obligations  determination of inflation rates regarding compensation levels and health care cost projections 
the company develops its demographics and utilizes the work of actuaries to assist with the measurement of employee related obligations 
the assumptions used vary from year to year  which will affect future results of operations 
any differences among these assumptions and the results actually experienced will also impact future results of operations 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  the company generally provides taxes at the rate applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdiction 
where the company s present intention is to reinvest in foreign ventures the unremitted earnings of certain of its foreign operations  the company does not provide for us income taxes on such unremitted earnings of those foreign subsidiaries 
management periodically assesses the need to utilize these unremitted earnings to finance the foreign operations of the company 
this assessment is based on cash flow projections that are the result of estimates of future production  commodity pricing and expenditures by tax jurisdiction for the company s operations 
such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the cash flow projections are subject to revision in the future 
management also periodically assesses  by tax jurisdiction  the probability of recovery of recorded deferred tax assets based on its assessment of future earnings outlooks 
such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the assessments are subject to revision in the future 
results of operations net income the company reported net income for of  or per share  or per share on a diluted basis  compared to net income for of  or per share  or per share on a diluted basis  and net income for of  or per share  or per share on a diluted basis 
among other items affecting net income for  and were pre tax gains of   and  respectively  related to the company s sale of certain non strategic properties as part of its asset rationalization process 
the  recorded in reflects gains of  on the sale of the company s sea robin gas plant  which was partially offset by losses on the sale of various other non strategic offshore properties 
the company has announced that it will continue to examine its non strategic assets and will sell them if it believes that it can obtain a fair price  but that it does not currently believe that such sales will have a material impact on the company s ongoing business activities 
earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for of   on a diluted basis  compared to   on a diluted basis for and   on a diluted basis for the increase in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for  compared to  resulted primarily from the conversion of  of the  outstanding trust preferred securities into  shares of the company s common stock on june  and to a much lesser extent  the issuance of shares upon the exercise of stock options pursuant to the company s stock option plans and stock issued as compensation 
the increase in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for  compared to  resulted primarily from the issuance of  shares of common stock to former shareholders of noric on march   the conversion of the trust preferred securities into the company s common stock and to a much lesser extent  the issuance of shares upon the exercise of stock options pursuant to the company s stock option plans and stock issued as compensation 
the earnings per share computations on a diluted basis in  and primarily reflect additional shares of common stock issuable upon the assumed conversion of the company s convertible subordinated notes due the notes and the trust preferred securities on a weighted average basis in and the elimination of related interest requirements  as adjusted for applicable federal income taxes and  to a lesser extent  the assumed exercise of options to purchase common shares 
in addition  the number of common shares outstanding in the diluted computation is adjusted to include dilutive shares that are assumed to have been issued by the company in connection with outstanding options  less treasury shares that are assumed to have been purchased by the company from the option proceeds 
total revenues the company s total revenues for were  an increase of approximately compared to total revenues of  for  and an increase of approximately compared to total revenues of  for the increase in the company s total revenues for  compared to and  resulted primarily from increased oil and gas revenues  partially offset by a decrease in pipeline sales which are included in other revenues 
oil and gas revenues the company s oil and gas revenues for were  an increase of approximately from oil and gas revenues of  for  and an increase of approximately from oil and gas revenues of  for the following table reflects an analysis of variances in the company s oil and gas revenues expressed in thousands between and the previous two years compared to increase decrease in oil and gas revenues resulting in variances in natural gas price production crude oil and condensate price production natural gas liquids increase in oil and gas revenues the increase in the company s oil and gas revenues in  compared to  is related to increases in the company s hydrocarbon production volumes which were only partially offset by a decrease in the average price that the company received for natural gas production volumes 
the increase in the company s oil and gas revenues in  compared to  is related to increases in the company s hydrocarbon production volumes which were only partially offset by decreases in the average prices that the company received for such production volumes

average prices are computed on production that is actually sold during the period and include the impact of the company s price hedging activity 
price hedging activity added to the average price of the company s north american crude oil and condensate production during and reduced the average price during for north american average prices  sales volumes equate to actual production 
however  in the gulf of thailand  crude oil and condensate sold may be more or less than actual production 
see footnote d 
d oil and condensate production in the gulf of thailand is produced and stored on the fpso and fso pending sale and is sold in tanker loads that typically average between  and  barrels per sale 
therefore  oil and condensate sales volumes for a given period in the gulf of thailand may not equate to actual production 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  reported revenues are based on sales volumes 
however  the company believes that actual production volumes also provide a meaningful measure of the company s operating results 
the company produced  barrels less than it sold in   barrels less than it sold in and  barrels more than it sold in natural gas thailand prices 
the price that the company receives under the gas sales agreement with ptt is based upon a formula that takes into account a number of factors including  among other items  changes in the thai us exchange rate and fuel oil prices in singapore 
the contract price is also subject to adjustments for quality 
an amendment to the gas sales agreement provided that for certain volumes the company produces in excess of the base contractual amount currently mmcf per day the price that the company receives from ptt will be equal to of the then current price calculated under its gas sales agreement 
the decrease in the average price that the company received for its natural gas production in the kingdom of thailand for compared to and  reflects a downward adjustment in the average price received under the gas sales agreement and  to a lesser extent  a reduced average price received on the excess production sold at lower prices 
see business international operations  contractual terms governing the thailand concession and related production 
production 
the increase in the company s natural gas production during  compared to and  was primarily related to production from properties acquired in the north central acquisition  successful development programs on the company s gulf of mexico properties  including its mississippi canyon blocks field  and increased thailand production  partially offset by natural production declines at other properties and weather related shut downs in the gulf of mexico 
crude oil and condensate thailand prices 
since the inception of production from the tantawan field  crude oil and condensate have been stored on the fpso until an economic quantity is accumulated for offloading and sale 
the first such sale of crude oil and condensate from the tantawan field occurred in july commencing in july when production began from the benchamas field  crude oil and condensate from that field has been stored on the fso and sold as economic quantities were accumulated 
a typical sale ranges from  to  barrels 
prices that the company receives for its crude oil and condensate production from thailand are based on world benchmark prices  typically as a differential to malaysian tapis crude  and are denominated in us dollars 
as discussed further under costs and expenses  lease operating expenses  the company records all crude oil held in the fpso and the fso at the end of an accounting period as inventory held at cost 
when such crude oil is sold  usually during the following month  the difference between the cost of the crude oil and the sales revenue is recognized in the income statement 
production 
the increase in the company s crude oil and condensate production during  compared to and  resulted primarily from the continuing success of the company s development program in the benchamas field in the kingdom of thailand  the commencement of production from the company s main pass blocks field  its mississippi canyon field and its ewing bank block field and  to a lesser extent  increased crude oil and condensate production in the kingdom of thailand 
these increases were partially offset by natural production declines at certain other properties and weather related shut downs in the gulf of mexico 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company records its oil production in the kingdom of thailand at the time of sale  rather than when produced 
at the end of each quarter  the crude oil and condensate stored on board the fso and fpso pending sale is accounted for as inventory at cost 
reported revenues are based on sales volumes 
when a tanker load of oil is sold in thailand  the entire amount will be accounted for as production sold  regardless of when it was produced 
as of december   the company had approximately  net barrels stored on board the fpso and fso 
ngl production 
the company s oil and gas revenues  and its total liquid hydrocarbon production  reflect the production and sale by the company of ngl  which are liquid products that are extracted from natural gas production 
the increase in ngl revenues for  compared with and  primarily related to ngl removed from the company s mississippi canyon blocks field gas production 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in the average prices that the company received for its ngl production during the comparative periods  from in to in and in costs and expenses comparison of increases decreases in change to change to lease operating expenses north america kingdom of thailand total lease operating expenses general and administrative expenses exploration expenses dry hole and impairment expenses depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expenses dd a rate mcfe sold a natural gas purchases and other interest charges interest income capitalized interest expense minority interest dividends and costs foreign currency transaction gain loss income tax expense a mcfe stands for thousands of cubic feet equivalent lease operating expenses the increase in north american lease operating expenses for  compared to  is related to higher production from the company s gulf of mexico properties  and to a lesser extent  increased maintenance costs during  partially offset by decreased severance taxes 
as a result of the increased production from its gulf of mexico properties  the company has also incurred increased product transportation and processing expenses and increased rental expenses for compressors and other equipment during in addition to the above factors  the increased lease operating expenses associated with properties acquired in the acquisition of north central completed on march  also impact the comparison of to the increase in north american lease operating expenses for  compared to  was primarily related to increased costs in associated with properties acquired in the north central acquisition  higher production from the company s gulf of mexico properties  increased product transportation and processing expenses and increased rental expenses for compressors and other equipment related to the higher production levels 
the increase in lease operating expenses in the kingdom of thailand for  compared to  primarily related to an increase in insurance expenses related to the construction of platforms and processing facilities for the benchamas field 
the increase in lease operating expenses in the kingdom of thailand for  compared to  primarily related to increased equipment rental expenses and increased insurance expenses related to construction of platforms for the benchamas field 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the portion of lifting costs that is attributable to crude oil and condensate stored on the fpso and fso is treated as an inventoried cost until that crude oil and condensate is sold 
at the time the crude oil and condensate is sold  those inventoried lifting costs are recognized as lease operating expenses 
variances in production  sales and operating costs will result in variances in the amount of lease operating expense that is currently recognized as expense and the amount recorded as product inventory to be recognized in subsequent periods 
a substantial portion of the company s lease operating expenses in the kingdom of thailand relates to the lease payments made in connection with the bareboat charter of the fpso for the tantawan field and the fso for the benchamas field 
collectively  these lease payments accounted for approximately   and  net to the company s interest of the company s thailand lease operating expenses for  and  respectively 
the company currently expects these lease payments to remain relatively constant at approximately  net to the company s interest for the next four years 
see liquidity and capital resources  capital requirements  other material long term commitments 
on a per unit of production basis  the company s total lease operating expenses have continued to decrease slightly from an average of per mcfe for and per mcfe for to per mcfe for general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses for  compared with and  primarily related to increased expenses associated with the company s acquisition of north central and its employees  as well as other increases in the size of the company s work force  normal increases in compensation and concomitant benefit expense and  to a lesser extent  increases in map purchases  office rent  insurance costs and audit fees 
on a per unit of production basis  the company s general and administrative expenses declined to per mcfe in  from per mcfe in and per mcfe in exploration expenses exploration expenses consist primarily of rental payments required under oil and gas leases to hold non producing properties delay rentals and exploratory geological and geophysical costs that are expensed as incurred 
the decrease in exploration expenses for  compared to and  resulted primarily from a decrease in d seismic acquisition activities during the and expense includes the cost of conducting d surveys in hungary  the cost of acquiring substantial new speculative d data sets in the gulf of mexico and seismic operations in canada 
the expense also includes the cost of transferring certain seismic licenses in connection with the north central acquisition 
there were no comparable expenses incurred in dry hole and impairment expenses dry hole and impairment expenses relate to costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells drilled and impairment of oil and gas properties 
during the company drilled gross unsuccessful exploratory wells net to the company s interest  in the company drilled gross unsuccessful exploratory wells net to the company s interest and in the company drilled gross unsuccessful exploratory wells net to the company s interest 
inclusive of development drilling  the company had an overall drilling success rate of in  in and in generally accepted accounting principles also require that if the expected future cash flow of the company s reserves on a property fall below the cost that is recorded on the company s books  these reserves must be impaired and written down to the property s fair value 
depending on market conditions  including the prices for oil and natural gas  and the results of operations  a similar test may be conducted at any time to determine whether impairments are appropriate 
depending on the results of this test  an impairment could be required on some of the company s properties and this impairment could have a material negative non cash impact on the company s earnings and balance sheet 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses the company s provision for dd a expense is based on its capitalized costs  plus future costs to abandon offshore wells and platforms  and is determined on a cost center by cost center basis using the units of production method 
the company generally creates cost centers on a field by field basis for oil and gas activities in the gulf of mexico and gulf of thailand 
generally  the company establishes cost centers on the basis of an oil or gas trend or play for its onshore oil and gas activities 
the increase in the company s dd a expenses for  compared to and  resulted primarily from an increase in the company s natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon production and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the company s composite dd a rate 
the increase in the composite dd a rate for all of the company s producing fields for  compared to and  resulted primarily from having a full year s production from fields acquired in the north central acquisition that  because they were valued at fair market value in connection with the acquisition  contribute a dd a rate higher than the company s historic average 
the increase was partially offset by an increased percentage of the company s production coming from certain of the company s fields that have dd a rates that are lower than the company s recent historical composite rate principally the benchamas field and certain gulf of mexico properties and a corresponding decrease in the percentage of the company s production coming from fields that have dd a rates that are higher than the company s recent historical composite dd a rate 
natural gas purchases and other revenue from the sale of natural gas purchased for resale is reported under revenues other 
the cost of purchasing natural gas  in addition to the costs of operating the company s pipeline carrying the natural gas  is recorded as an expense under natural gas purchases and other 
during and  primarily all of the natural gas purchased and resold by the company was transported on pogo onshore pipeline company s saginaw pipeline  which was sold during the fourth quarter of as part of the company s ongoing asset rationalization process 
during  substantially all of the gas purchased by the company is the result of purchases of natural gas volumes required to replace the reduction in heating content of the gas stream after the extraction of ngls 
these purchases were made to bring the gas stream to pipeline quality standards 
prior to  the company had been using its own natural gas production to replenish this extracted gas 
consequently  there is no meaningful comparison between the period and the and periods 
interest interest charges 
the increase in the company s interest charges for  compared to and  resulted primarily from an increase in the average amount of the company s outstanding debt largely related to the acquisition of north central in march  partially offset by a decline in the average interest rate on the outstanding debt 
interest income 
the decrease in the company s interest income for  compared to and  resulted primarily from a decrease in the interest rate received  partially offset by an increase in the amount of cash and cash equivalents temporarily invested 
the cash and cash equivalents on the company s balance sheet are primarily held by the company s international subsidiaries for future investment overseas  in part due to the negative tax effects that would result from the repatriation of these funds 
capitalized interest 
interest costs related to financing major oil and gas projects in progress are capitalized until the projects are substantially complete and ready for their intended use if projects are evaluated as successful 
the change in capitalized interest for  compared to and  resulted primarily from a decrease in the amount of capital expenditures subject to interest capitalization during approximately  compared to approximately  and an increase in the amount of capital expenditures subject to interest capitalization during compared to approximately 
these changes were also impacted by a decrease in the computed rate incurred by the company and applied to such capital expenditures to arrive at the total amount of capitalized interest 
a substantial percentage of the company s capitalized interest related to unevaluated properties acquired in the north central acquisition and capital expenditures for the development of the benchamas field in the gulf of thailand  as well as several development projects in the gulf of mexico 
minority interest dividends and costs associated with mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a subsidiary trust pogo trust i  a business trust in which the company owned all of the issued common securities  issued  of trust preferred securities on june  pogo trust i called the trust preferred securities for redemption on june  prior to their redemption  holders of  of the  outstanding trust preferred securities converted their trust preferred securities  representing over  face value of trust preferred securities  into  shares of the company s common stock 
in connection with the redemption  pogo trust i paid a total of  to former holders of the trust preferred securities 
subsequent to june   there were no trust preferred securities outstanding 
the amounts recorded under minority interest dividends and costs associated with preferred securities of a subsidiary trust principally reflect cumulative dividends and  to a lesser extent  the amortization of issuance expenses related to the offering and sale of the trust preferred securities 
foreign currency transaction gain loss the foreign currency transaction gain reported in and the losses reported for and resulted primarily from the fluctuation against the us dollar of cash and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in thai baht related to the company s thai operations 
during  the thai baht us dollar daily average exchange rate fluctuated between and baht to the us dollar 
the company cannot predict what the thai baht to us dollar exchange rate will be in the future 
as of february   the company was not a party to any financial instrument that was intended to constitute a foreign currency hedging arrangement 
income tax expense changes in the company s income tax expense are a function of the company s consolidated effective tax rate and its pre tax income 
the increase in the company s tax expense for  compared to and  resulted primarily from an increase in the company s effective tax rate during the comparative periods and from increased pre tax income during the company s consolidated effective tax rate for  and was  and  respectively 
the higher effective tax rate is the result of higher pre tax income derived from the company s thailand operations during the comparative periods  which is taxed at a rate higher than the us statutory rate  relative to its pre tax income from north american operations 
management currently expects that foreign income taxes will constitute a substantial portion of its overall tax burden for the foreseeable future

cash flow from operating activities in was more than adequate to fund  in cash expenditures for capital and exploration projects for the year 
the company also repaid approximately  of financing obligations during as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  including  in international subsidiaries which the company currently intends to reinvest in its foreign operations  positive working capital  excluding cash  of  and long term debt obligations of  excluding debt discount of  with no repayment obligations until in addition  the company had  of available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility

future capital and other expenditure requirements the company s capital and exploration budget for  which does not include any amounts that may be expended for the purchase of proved reserves or any interest which may be capitalized resulting from projects in progress  was established by the company s board of directors at  the company currently anticipates that its cash provided by operating activities  available cash and cash investments and funds available under its credit agreement and its banker s acceptance facility  will be sufficient to fund the company s ongoing operating  interest and general and administrative expenses  its authorized capital budget and dividend payments at current levels for the forseeable future 
the declaration and amount of future dividends on the company s common stock will depend upon  among other things  the company s future earnings and financial condition  liquidity and capital requirements  its ability to pay dividends and other payments under certain covenants contained in its debt instruments  the general economic and regulatory climate and other factors deemed relevant by the company s board of directors 
other material long term commitments contractual cash obligations 
the company s material contractual cash obligations include long term debt  operating leases  and other contracts 
material contractual cash obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable include derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and other factors 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
a summary of the company s known contractual cash obligations as of december  are set forth on the following table payments due by year in millions after total long term debt operating leases a drilling obligations b firm transportation agreements c total a operating leases principally include the lease of the fpso and fso in thailand  the company s office lease commitments and various other equipment rentals  including gas compressors 
where rented equipment  such as compressors  is considered essential to the operation of the oil and gas property  the company has assumed that such equipment will be leased for the estimated productive life of the reserves  even if the existing contract for such equipment terminates prior to such date 
b this represents the company s share of the contractual commitments for one rig drilling in the gulf of thailand and its license commitment to drill a well in the danish north sea 
no other drilling rigs working for the company are currently under contracts that have a term greater than six months or cannot be terminated at the end of the well that is currently being drilled 
due to their short term nature and our inability to quantify the remaining liabilities on rigs drilling on a well by well basis  such obligations have not been included in this table 
c firm transportation agreements represent ship or pay arrangements whereby the company has committed to ship certain volumes of gas for a fixed transportation fee principally from the madden field in wyoming 
the company entered into these arrangements to ensure its access to gas markets and currently expects to produce sufficient volumes to satisfy substantially all of its firm transportation obligations 
commitments under joint operating agreements 
the oil and gas industry operates in many instances through joint ventures under joint operating agreements and the company s operations are no exception 
typically  the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts  such as drilling contracts  for the benefit of all joint venture partners 
through the joint operating agreement  the non operators reimburse  and in some cases advance  the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator 
these obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis 
the joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator in the event that the non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations 
occasionally  the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses  frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses 
the contractual obligations set forth above represent the company s working interest share of the contractual commitments that it has entered into as operator and  to the extent that it is aware  the contractual commitments entered into by the operator of projects that the company does not operate 
surety bonds 
in the ordinary course of the company s business and operations  it is required to post surety bonds from time to time with third parties  including governmental agencies  primarily to cover self insurance  site restoration  equipment dismantlement  plugging and abandonment obligations 
as of december   the company had obtained surety bonds from a number of insurance and bonding institutions covering certain operations in the united states in the aggregate amount of approximately  that are not included in the prior table 
in connection with their administration of offshore leases in the gulf of mexico  the mms annually evaluates each lessee s plugging and abandonment liabilities 
the mms reviews this information and applies certain financial tests including  but not limited to  current asset and net worth tests 
the mms determines whether each lessee is financially capable of paying the estimated costs of such plugging and abandonment liabilities 
the company must annually provide the mms with financial information 
if the company does not satisfy the mms requirements  it could be required to post supplemental bonds 
in the past  the company has not been required to post supplemental bonds  however  there can be no assurance that the company will satisfy the financial tests and remain on the list of mms lessees exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements 
the company cannot predict or quantify the amount of any such supplemental bonds or the annual premiums related thereto and therefore has not included them in the prior table  but the amount could be substantial 
guarantee and letters of credit 
the company has also issued performance guarantees related to the operations of its subsidiaries in thailand  hungary  the united kingdom and denmark 
if its subsidiaries do not fulfill their contractual obligations or legal obligations under the relevant local laws  the company could be obligated to make payments to satisfy the subsidiaries obligations 
most of these obligations relate to work commitments  plugging  abandoment  site restoration and compliance with environmental laws 
the company also has guaranteed performance of its subsidiaries obligations under the fpso lease 
to the extent quantifiable  such subsidiaries contractual commitments have been included in the prior table 
however  the company s guarantee of these obligations has not been so included 
currently  a letter of credit in the amount of million has been issued on the company s behalf 
capital structure credit facility 
effective march   the company entered into a revolving credit facility the credit facility with a group of lenders 
the credit facility provides for a  revolving loan facility terminating on march  the amount that may be borrowed under the new facility may not exceed a borrowing base that is determined no less than semi annually and is calculated based upon substantially all of the company s proved oil and gas properties 
the borrowing base is currently set at  the next redetermination of the borrowing base is expected to occur by may  the borrowing base is determined by the lenders based on their own proprietary credit criteria  which appear to be strongly correlated to the quantity of the company s proven oil and gas reserves and the lenders expectations as to the future revenues that the company can expect to receive from the sale of these oil and gas reserves 
a significant decline in the prices that the company is expected to receive for its future oil and gas production could have a materially negative impact on the borrowing base under the credit facility which  in turn  could have a material negative impact on the company s liquidity 
the credit facility is governed by various financial and other covenants  including requirements to maintain positive working capital excluding current maturities of debt and a fixed charge coverage ratio  and limitations on creation of liens  commodity hedging above specified limits  the prepayment of subordinated debt  the payment of dividends  mergers and consolidations  investments and asset dispositions 
in addition  the company is prohibited from pledging borrowing base properties as security for other debt 
the company has pledged the stock of north central and its inter company receivables with north central as collateral for its obligations under the credit facility 
if at a redetermination of the borrowing base  the lenders reduce the borrowing base below the amount then outstanding under the credit agreement and other senior debt arrangements  the company must repay the excess to the lenders in no more than five substantially equal monthly installments  commencing not later than days after the company is notified of the new borrowing base 
the credit facility also permits short term swing line loans and the issuance of up to  in letters of credit as a part of the facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at the company s option  at a base prime rate plus a variable margin currently none or libor plus a variable margin currently 
the margin varies as a function of the percentage of the borrowing base being utilized and  with respect to the libor rate loans  the company s credit rating 
a commitment fee on the unborrowed amount that is currently available under the credit facility is also charged based upon the percentage of the borrowing base that is being utilized 
as of february   there was  outstanding under the credit facility 
banker s acceptances 
under a master banker s acceptance agreement  one of the company s lenders makes available to the company banker s drafts on an uncommitted basis up to  drafts drawn under this agreement are reflected as long term debt on the company s balance sheet because the company currently has the ability and intent to reborrow such amounts under the credit facility 
the company s notes  notes and its notes may restrict all or a portion of the amounts that may be borrowed under the master banker s acceptance agreement as senior debt

other matters inflation 
publicly held companies are asked to comment on the effects of inflation on their business 
currently annual inflation in terms of the decrease in the general purchasing power of the dollar is running much below the general annual inflation rates experienced in the past 
while the company  like other companies  continues to be affected by fluctuations in the purchasing power of the dollar due to inflation  such effect is not currently considered significant 
southeast asia economic issues 
a substantial portion of the company s oil and gas operations are conducted in southeast asia  and a substantial portion of its natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon production is sold there 
southeast asia in general  and the kingdom of thailand in particular  experienced severe economic difficulties in and which were characterized by sharply reduced economic activity  illiquidity  highly volatile foreign currency exchange rates and unstable stock markets 
since that time  the economic situation in the kingdom of thailand has generally stabilized 
however  as with most emerging market economies  the thai economy remains particularly sensitive to worldwide economic trends 
the economic health of the thai economy and its effect on the volatility of the thai baht against the dollar will continue to have a material impact on the company s operations in the kingdom of thailand  together with the prices that the company receives for its oil and natural gas production there 
see results of operations  oil and gas revenues and results of operations  foreign currency transaction gain loss 
all of the company s current natural gas production from the thailand concession is committed under a long term gas sales agreement to ptt at prices denominated in thai baht which are determined in accordance with a formula that is intended to ameliorate  at least in part  any decline in the purchasing power of the thai baht against the dollar 
see business international operations  contractual terms governing the thailand concession and business miscellaneous  sales 
although the company currently believes that ptt will honor its commitments under the gas sales agreement  a failure by ptt to honor such commitments could have a material adverse effect on the company 
during  the government of thailand partially privatized the petroleum authority of thailand  forming ptt and retaining an ownership interest of approximately 
ptt is a publicly traded entity that currently constitutes one of  if not the largest  public companies in the kingdom of thailand 
however  its contractual obligations are no longer backed by the full faith and credit of the thai government 
prices that the company receives for production from its thailand concession are based on world benchmark prices  which are denominated in dollars  and are typically paid in dollars

recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued several new pronouncements including  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas no 
sfas 
sfas sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
the company adopted this standard as required on january  and will reflect an after tax non cash charge to earnings of approximately million representing the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
sfas sfas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance set forth in eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
the company adopted this standard as required on january  implementation of the new standard had no impact upon adoption and is not expected to have a material financial statement impact on the company 
sfas sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for employee stock based compensation 
in addition  sfas requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for employee stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas  prospectively to all employee awards granted  modified or settled after january  the adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of sfas will result in compensation expense for stock option grants 
had the company followed the fair value recognition provisions of sfas during  net income and shareholders equity would have been reduced by approximately million 
however  since the company has elected a prospective transition method  the impact on net income will be limited to awards granted after january   and no compensation expense will be recognized on unvested awards outstanding at january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces  purchases and sells natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls 
as a result  the company s financial results can be significantly affected as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
in the past  the company has made limited use of a variety of derivative financial instruments only for non trading purposes as a hedging strategy to manage commodity prices associated with oil and gas sales and to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations 
see business competition and market conditions 
interest rate risk from time to time  the company has entered into various financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage the impact of changes in interest rates 
as of february   the company has no open interest rate swap or interest rate lock agreements 
therefore  the company s exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
the following table presents principal or notional amounts stated in thousands and related average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s debt obligations and their indicated fair market value at december  thereafter total fair value long term debt variable rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk in addition to the us dollar  the company and certain of its subsidiaries conduct their business in thai baht and hungarian forint and are therefore subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing and investing transactions 
the company conducts a substantial portion of its oil and gas production and sales in southeast asia 
southeast asia in general  and the kingdom of thailand in particular  have experienced severe economic difficulties in the recent past  including sharply reduced economic activity  illiquidity  highly volatile foreign currency exchange rates and unstable stock markets 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations  foreign currency transaction gain loss and liquidity and capital resources  other matters  southeast asia economic issues 
the economic situation in thailand and the volatility of the thai baht against the dollar could have a material impact on the company s thailand operations and prices that the company receives for its oil and gas production there 
although the company s sales to ptt under the gas sales agreement are denominated in baht  because predominantly all of the company s crude oil sales and its capital and most other expenditures in the kingdom of thailand are denominated in dollars  the dollar is the functional currency for the company s operations in the kingdom of thailand 
as of february   the company is not a party to any foreign currency exchange agreement 
exposure from market rate fluctuations related to activities in hungary  where the company s functional currency is the legal tender in hungary currently the forint  is not material at this time 
current hedging activity as of december   the company held various derivative instruments 
during  the company entered into natural gas and crude oil option agreements referred to as collars 
collars are designed to establish floor and ceiling prices on anticipated future natural gas and crude oil production 
the company has designated these contracts as cash flow hedges designed to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce its exposure to price volatility 
while the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
the use of derivatives also involves the risk that the counterparties to such instruments will be unable to meet the financial terms of such contracts 
currently  the company does not expect losses due to credit worthiness of its counterparties 
the gas hedging transactions are generally settled based upon the average of the reporting settlement prices on the nymex for the last three trading days of a particular contract month 
the oil hedging transactions are generally settled based on the average of the reporting settlement prices on the nymex for each trading day of a particular calendar month 
for any particular collar transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to the company if the settlement price for any settlement period is below the floor price for such transaction  and the company is required to make a payment to the counterparty if the settlement price for any settlement period is above the ceiling price of such transaction 
the estimated fair value of these transactions is based upon various factors that include closing exchange prices on the nymex  over the counter quotations  volatility and the time value of options
