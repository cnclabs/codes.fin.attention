results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  three months ended december  compared to three months ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  proceedings under chapter of bankruptcy code historical pro forma results of ongoing operations quarterly information year ended december  compared to the pro forma year ended december  use of non gaap financial measures summary of lease agreements operating strategies and forward looking information critical accounting policies recent accounting pronouncements risk factors results of operations the company emerged from chapter on may  and implemented fresh start accounting as of june  results of operations for the day period from may  through june  were not material 
in accordance with fresh start accounting  all assets and liabilities were restated to reflect their respective fair values 
the consolidated financial statements after that date are those of a new reporting entity and are not comparable to the periods prior to emergence 
however  for purposes of this discussion  the successor results for the seven months ended december  have been combined with the predecessor results for the five months ended june  and then compared to the successor results for the fiscal year ended december  and the predecessor results for the fiscal year ended december  differences between periods due to fresh start accounting are explained when necessary 
results for these periods are summarized in the following table national vision  inc consolidated statements of operations in thousands year ended year ended december  year ended december  a december  retail sales  net premium revenue total net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general administrative expense impairment of long lived assets restructuring expense operating income loss interest expense  net loss before reorganization items  taxes and extraordinary items reorganization expense gain earnings loss before taxes income taxes net earnings loss before extraordinary item extraordinary gain loss  net of taxes cumulative effect  net of taxes net earnings loss a represents the combined results of the successor for the seven months ended december  and the results of the predecessor for the five months ended june  the company s results of operations in any period are significantly affected by the number and mix of vision centers operating during such period 
at december   the company operated vision centers  versus vision centers at december  and vision centers at december  the freestanding stores open at year end were disposed of during the first half of the following table sets forth information about the number and type of vision centers owned and operated by the company as of the end of fiscal  and  respectively 
december  december  december  wal mart  domestic fred meyer military wal mart de mexico freestanding stores total year ended december  current year compared to year ended december  prior year net sales 
the company recorded net sales of million in the current year versus million in the prior year  a decrease of or million 
this decrease is mostly attributable to the sale or closure of the company s freestanding operations in the first half of these stores represented sales of million in the offsetting sales increase of million came from the following areas million of premium revenue from a managed care insurance product that the company began selling in the wal mart california vision centers during  and a domestic comparable store sales increase of and sales from new stores opened since the end of historically  the company s in store presentation of frame and lens options was based on a package price concept 
the package price included a pair of base lenses  a frame and certain lens options 
in july  the company changed its presentation strategy by unbundling the package price so that pricing for frames and lenses are separately presented in the store 
the new presentation is intended to be more clear  concise and customer friendly and is similar to product and price presentation at a majority of our competitors stores 
after an initial orientation phase  the company has experienced increases in the average spectacle transaction value and in spectacle unit count 
although we expect these positive trends to continue  we can provide no assurance regarding future average transaction value or spectacle unit count 
gross profit 
in the current year  gross profit dollars decreased by million over gross profit dollars in the prior year 
this decrease in gross profit dollars is primarily the result of the disposition of the company s freestanding operations in the first half of the retail and insurance components of sales and gross profit for the current and prior year are detailed below in thousands year ended year ended december  december  retail sales  net retail cost of goods sold retail gross profit premium revenue claims expense insurance gross profit total net sales total cost of goods sold total gross profit retail gross profit increased as a percent of sales in the current year 
the company experienced a shift in sales mix toward eyeglasses  coupled with an increase in eyeglass margins in the current year partially as a result of the company s unbundling of frame and lens pricing 
this margin improvement was offset by an increase in rent expense which is a component of gross profit for the wal mart division 
this was due to approximately vision centers entering the year option period of the wal mart lease 
the option period effectively increases each location s minimum rent requirement 
as of december   we have vision centers in the three year option period of the wal mart lease 
we expect this trend of increased rent to continue as additional wal mart locations enter the option period of their lease 
during  the company s effective rent percentage on the wal mart store revenues was approximately 
any significant shortfall in comparable store sales would have a negative impact on occupancy expense as a percent of sales 
the company cannot give any assurances that it will be able to continue to record comparable sales increases at these levels 
insurance gross profit represents premium revenue less claims expense for a managed care insurance product that the company began selling in the wal mart california vision centers in the second quarter of we do not expect a significant change in insurance gross profit as a percent of premium revenue in future periods 
the addition of the lower margin managed care insurance product increase total revenues and gross profit dollars  but decreases total gross profit as a percent of total net sales 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense 
sg a expense which includes both store operating expenses and home office overhead decreased to from the prior year amount of million 
this dollar decrease was primarily the result of lower payroll  depreciation and other expenses due to the above mentioned disposition of the company s freestanding operations in april also  sg a expense declined as a percentage of sales to in the current year compared to in the prior year 
the percentage decrease in sg a was the result of significant improvements in managed care processing which resulted in a decline in receivable write offs of approximately million in the current year  a prior year predecessor company charge of million for uncollectible managed care receivables million of which related to the ongoing host businesses  and a reduction in advertising spending of approximately million in the current year versus the prior year 
this decrease was partially offset by approximately  in incremental costs incurred for evaluating and implementing organizational changes 
these costs are expected to continue in the first half of as we proceed with this process  and increases in retail level payroll costs  which increased approximately million or of sales over the prior year 
this payroll increase was due to an increase in health and medical benefit costs and an increase in rates in certain markets  where growing competition resulted in upward pressure on rates for optical personnel 
operating income 
operating income increased from a loss of million in the prior year to income of million in the current year primarily due to the disposition of the freestanding operations in april operating income as a percentage of sales was in the current year  compared to in the prior year 
interest expense 
interest expense in the current year represents a full year s worth of interest incurred on an average subordinated debt balance of million 
as a result of the company s chapter proceedings  the company did not accrue interest on subordinated debt until it emerged from chapter in may reorganization gain 
the reorganization gain of million in is discussed in detail under year ended december  compared to year ended december  income taxes 
the company incurred tax operating losses in and resulting tax benefits have been offset by a valuation allowance as realization is considered unlikely 
extraordinary gain  net 
during the current year  the company repurchased notes with a face value of approximately million for million in cash  which included accrued interest of approximately  these transactions resulted in an extraordinary  non cash gain of million 
the extraordinary gain in the prior year represents the gain on extinguishment of debt as recorded in fresh start accounting 
net income loss 
the company posted a net loss of million in the current year versus net income of million in the prior year 
the current period variance is primarily the result of fresh start adjustments and the gain on extinguishments of debt recognized in may as the company emerged from chapter l 
ebitda 
ebitda is calculated as net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  extraordinary items  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and reorganization items

the following is a reconciliation of net earnings to ebitda net earnings loss addback interest expense  net reorganization expense gain income tax expense extraordinary gain loss  net cumulative effect  net depreciation and amortization ebitda three months ended december  current three months compared to the three months ended december  prior three months condensed consolidated results for the fourth quarter of and are included in the quarterly pro forma table on page both quarters shown are actual results 
we are presenting a discussion of fourth quarter results as we believe it is relevant to the reader in conjunction with consideration and review of the quarterly financial results filed with the sec for the first  second and third quarters of significant variances are discussed below 
net sales 
the company recorded net sales of million in the current three months versus million in the prior three months  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to november programs that gave rise to a quarterly domestic comparable store sales increase of 
premium revenue of approximately million in the current three months also contributed to the total net sales increase 
gross profit 
in the current three months  gross profit dollars increased by million over the prior three months 
gross profit percentages declined from in the prior three months to in the current three months as the product mix shifted towards contact lenses and accessories  which have lower margins than eyeglass sales 
also  premium revenues  which have a gross profit margin of approximately to  contributed to the decline in gross profit percentage in the current three months 
also  in connection with finalizing financial results for  the company recorded certain adjustments which had the effect of increasing cost of goods sold from levels preliminarily reported in a form k filed on april  selling  general and administrative expense sg a 
sg a expense which includes both store operating expenses and home office overhead increased from million in the prior three months to million in the current three months 
increases in compensation costs were a significant factor in the dollar increase in sg a expenses 
more specifically  fourth quarter includes payroll cost in excess of million related to a quarterly management incentive plan as well as approximately  of expenses related to its review of the company s retail and support organization 
expenses for this project will continue into the first half of  as we proceed with this process 
sg a expense decreased as a percent of sales from in the prior three months to in the current three months 
this decline is partially due to significant improvements in managed care processing which resulted in a decline in receivable write offs in the current three months  and a reduction in advertising spending in the current three months versus the prior three months 
the current year improvement in sg a expenses as a percent of sales was partially offset by increases in rent expense which is a component of gross profit as a percent of sales for the wal mart division 
this was due to approximately vision centers entering the three year option period of the wal mart lease since the end of the prior year 
the option period effectively increases each location s minimum rent requirement 
we expect this trend of increased rent to continue as additional wal mart locations enter the option period of their lease 
during  the company s effective rent percentage on the wal mart store revenues was approximately 
any significant shortfall in comparable store sales would have a negative impact on occupancy expense as a percent of sales 
the company cannot give any assurances that it will be able to continue to record comparable sales increases at historical levels 
operating income 
operating income for the current three months declined million to a loss of  from a loss of  in the prior three months primarily due to the shift in product mix as previously discussed 
interest expense 
interest expense declined by million in the current three months to million due to principal repayments and repurchases totaling million since the prior three months 
extraordinary gain 
the company repurchased notes with a face value of approximately million for million in cash  which included accrued interest of approximately  these transactions resulted in an extraordinary  non cash gain of million in the current three months 
net loss 
the company s net loss in the current three months was approximately million compared to a net loss of million in the prior three months 
this improvement of million over the prior three months is attributable to three factors strong operating performance in the current three months  as evidenced by domestic comparable store sales growth of  decreases in interest expense due to reductions in the total outstanding debt  and an extraordinary gain of approximately million as we repurchased a portion of our senior subordinated debt at a discount 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
the company recorded net sales of million in fiscal  a decrease of from sales of million in fiscal sales decreased due to the following reasons in april  the company disposed of the remainder of its freestanding stores 
these stores had sales of approximately million in versus sales of million in the company closed all of its sam s club operations in the third quarter of these locations had sales of approximately million in fiscal comparable store sales in the company s wal mart business declined from levels recorded in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was partially offset by sales from new stores opened in gross profit 
in the current year  gross profit decreased to million from million in the prior year 
this decrease in gross profit was primarily driven by a reduction in sales caused by the closure of the freestanding locations and the sam s club locations 
gross margin  as a percent of sales  increased to from in the prior year 
gross margin percentage was positively impacted by an increase in eyeglass margins  resulting from the introduction and repositioning of certain eyeglass lens items and additional price point options placed on the frame boards 
also  the company recorded a charge of approximately million and million to adjust inventory of the freestanding locations to its net realizable value in the current year and the prior year  respectively 
the current year improvement was partially offset by increases in rent expense which is a component of gross profit as a percent of sales for the wal mart division 
this was due to approximately vision centers entering the three year option period of the wal mart lease since the end of the prior year 
the option period effectively increases each location s minimum rent requirement 
we expect this trend of increased rent to continue as additional wal mart locations enter the option period of their lease 
the company believes that  on the basis of comparable store sales growth it has historically achieved over the five year period prior to  occupancy expense under the wal mart agreement as a percent of sales should not  in the foreseeable future  increase by more than one percentage point over levels recorded in during  the company s effective rent percentage on the wal mart store revenues was approximately 
the company cannot give any assurances that it will be able to continue to record comparable sales increases at these historical levels 
any significant shortfall in comparable store sales would have a negative impact on occupancy expense as a percent of sales 
selling  general  and administrative expense sg a expense 
sg a expense which includes both store operating expenses and home office overhead decreased to million in the current year from million for the prior year 
the dollar decrease was primarily the result of lower payroll  depreciation and other expenses due to the above mentioned store dispositions and closures 
however  sg a expense increased as a percent of sales from in the prior year to in the current year 
the percentage increase in sg a was the result of the amortization of the newly established intangible value of contractual rights of approximately million for the seven months ended december   a million charge for uncollectible managed care receivables in the predecessor company million of which related to ongoing businesses  an increase in freestanding healthcare costs of approximately million  and an increase in third party processing costs as a result of increased managed care sales and receipts 
third party processing costs as a percentage of sales are expected to increase as sales under managed care programs increase 
the percentage increase in sg a partially offset by a decrease in retail and field supervision payroll costs as a percent of sales primarily due to the closure of the freestanding stores that had higher payroll costs as a percent of sales  a charge of approximately million in the prior year to adjust accounts receivable in the company s freestanding stores to net realizable value  and a reduction in total advertising expenditures in the current year due to the disposal of the company s freestanding locations 
historically the company s advertising expenditures for the freestanding locations have been in excess of of sales  well in excess of expenditures as a percentage of sales for the domestic host businesses 
advertising for the company s domestic host businesses in is up slightly from historical levels 
impairment loss and restructuring expense 
in the first quarter of  the company recorded a non cash pre tax charge of approximately million  primarily related to the impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures of stores which were closed prior to the company s chapter filing 
also  the company recorded a million reserve for anticipated closing costs which was comprised of million of lease termination costs and million of severance and other closing costs 
operating loss 
the operating loss for the current year was million compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
operating loss as a percentage of sales prior to the restructuring reserve and the impairment loss was in the current year  compared to a loss of in the prior year 
this improvement was primarily due to the closure of the freestanding locations and the sam s club locations 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million compared to million in the prior year 
in the prior year  the company stopped accruing interest on unsecured debt 
the company emerged from bankruptcy on may   and new senior notes in the amount of million  bearing interest of  were issued and the previous notes were cancelled 
the new notes were outstanding for seven months in the current period and interest of approximately million was accrued 
contractual interest for the prior year was million 
reorganization items 
the company recorded all transactions incurred as a result of the chapter filing separately as reorganization items 
there were no reorganization items recorded after june   as the company emerged from bankruptcy 
the table below summarizes the items incurred by the predecessor company amounts in thousands five months twelve months ended ended june  december  fresh start adjustments a impairment of goodwill impairment of fixed assets provision for rejected leases loss on disposal of freestanding division other store closing costs retention plan professional fees letter of credit reserve on dip facility interest income on accumulated cash other reorganization costs reorganization gain expense a the adjustments represent the elimination of predecessor company equity and the fair value adjustments that were made as part of fresh start accounting 
benefit for income taxes 
the company generated operating losses for tax purposes in no income tax benefit has been recorded as realization is not considered probable 
extraordinary items 
in  as part of the company s emergence from bankruptcy  the predecessor company recognized an extraordinary gain of million related to the extinguishment of debt 
the gain was calculated as follows net liabilities subject to compromise deferred financing costs related to cancelled senior notes net liabilities extinguished less reorganized value gain on extinguishment of debt the results also include an extraordinary loss of  associated with the write off of the capitalized costs of the company s previous foothill credit facility 
net income loss 
the company posted net income of million in the current year versus a net loss of million in the prior year 
of the net income of million  million results from a reorganization gain  as noted above 
ebitda 
ebitda is calculated as net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  extraordinary items  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  and reorganization items 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations use of non gaap financial measures 
the following is a reconciliation of operating income to ebitda amounts in thousands net earnings loss addback interest expense  net reorganization expense gain income tax expense extraordinary gain loss  net cumulative effect  net depreciation and amortization ebitda proceedings under chapter of the bankruptcy code on april   the company and ten of its subsidiaries collectively  the debtors filed voluntary petitions with the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of georgia for reorganization under chapter the chapter cases 
in march  the debtors filed a plan of reorganization the plan for the chapter cases 
the plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on may  on may   after securing a new revolving credit facility with fleet capital corporation  the company emerged from bankruptcy 
under the plan  the company s pre petition unsecured claims were converted into new secured notes and common stock 
the secured notes have a face value of million  provide for the payment of interest of twice a year at the end of march and september  and are subordinated to debt under the company s credit facility 
the notes are payable over eight years with principal repayments based on excess cash flow for the prior six month period 
five million shares of new common stock  par value  were issued  based on the company s reorganization value 
under the plan  former shareholders received no value for their interests  consequently  all common stock issued prior to emergence from bankruptcy was cancelled 
the company s reorganization value was developed by the company  the official committee of unsecured creditors and their respective financial advisors 
the reorganization value was based on a calculation of the present value of the free cash flows under the company s financial projections  including an assumption of a terminal value 
such projections were necessarily based on a variety of estimates and assumptions which might not be realized and are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies 
some assumptions inevitably will not materialize 
the projections therefore should not be considered as a guarantee or other assurance of actual results 
the allocation of the company s reorganization value is shown below reorganized value new debt new equity reorganization value in the allocation of the reorganization value  the company s tangible and intangible assets were recorded at their assumed fair value 
intangible value of contractual rights  approximating million  was established as part of fresh start accounting and will be amortized over years using the straight line method 
this intangible asset represents the value of the company s lease agreement and the business relationship developed with wal mart 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  this intangible is an amortizable asset because it has a finite useful life 
however  the precise length of its life is subject to future change due to various reasons  including the wal mart superstore conversions that automatically trigger extensions on the contractual life of the asset  possible changes and or extensions to the master lease agreement as well as other businesses that may be developed through our relationship with wal mart 
based on projections  management believes that the best estimate of the useful life of this asset is years 
due to the uncertainty involved in predicting the pattern of economic benefits realized from the wal mart relationship  this asset is amortized using the straight line method 
historical pro forma results of ongoing operations 
on april  the predecessor company completed the sale of its freestanding retail operations to vista acquisition llc the buyer 
we received consideration of approximately million  consisting of million in cash and a million note receivable 
the note receivable was fully reserved at the time of the sale  due to the low probability of collection 
the assets sold consisted primarily of furniture  fixtures and inventory at approximately freestanding locations and inventory and equipment at the fullerton  california laboratory distribution center 
in a related transaction  the company agreed to sell  subject to regulatory approval  to the buyer its interest in a managed care subsidiary 
the net book value of the assets of the subsidiary million was fully reserved upon the agreement date as the buyer took possession of these assets  however  the company received no consideration from the buyer for these assets and future receipt was uncertain 
for purposes of the unaudited pro forma financial information  these transactions have been combined 
the following information presents the company s results of operations for the retail store operations retained by the company upon emergence from bankruptcy in june in addition to the exclusion of the freestanding store financial results  the pro forma information also excludes the financial results of other dispositions that occurred during the bankruptcy process  including the sam s club stores and meijer thrifty acres stores 
accordingly  data for the first and second quarter of is presented on a pro forma basis as if all disposed operations were closed or disposed of as of the beginning of the pro forma information does not necessarily reflect actual results that would have occurred nor is it necessarily indicative of future results of operations of the company without the closed or disposed operations

gross profit as a percent of sales decreased to from in the pro forma prior year 
this percentage decrease was partially driven by million in sales of a new managed care product in the company s california wal mart stores 
this product has a profit margin of approximately to of sales  which served to increase the company s gross profit dollars  but decreases gross profit as a percent of sales 
operating income declined in the current year primarily as a result of the amortization of intangible value of contractual rights and depreciation of revalued fixed assets  both of which were established during fresh start accounting 
the incremental increase in these expenses was million in the current year 
this increase in expenses was partially offset by the prior year non cash provision of million related to receivables 
sg a expense increased due to an increase in payroll costs as a percent of sales primarily resulting from new store openings and an increase in benefit costs and payroll rates in certain markets where increased competition has resulted in upward pressure on rates for optical personnel 
also  in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred approximately  of consulting expenses and other organizational costs as part of our review of the retail and support organizations  processes and technology 
use of non gaap financial measures we frequently refer to ebitda in this document 
ebitda is calculated as net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  extraordinary items  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  and reorganization items as defined in the terms of our senior subordinated debt agreement 
we refer to ebitda because it is the basis for the calculation of the excess cash flow principal repayment under our senior notes  and it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to service or incur indebtedness 
ebitda does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs  should not be considered an alternative to net income or to cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an indication of our operating performance or as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures for other companies

summary of lease agreements we have agreements governing our operations in host environments  such as wal mart 
typically  each agreement is for a base term  followed by an option to renew for a specified length of time 
the agreements provide for payments of minimum and percentage rent  and also contain customary provisions for leased department operations 
the table below sets forth key data about each of these agreements no 
of options vision centers no 
of units as of length of base length of option exercisable in located in december  term in years term in years fiscal wal mart fred meyer wal mart de mexico or military bases or wal mart vision centers our agreement with wal mart gives us the right to open vision centers  the last of which opened in our agreement with wal mart also provides that  if wal mart converts its own store to a supercenter a store which contains a grocery department in addition to the traditional wal mart store offering and relocates our vision center as part of the conversion  the term of our lease begins again 
during  locations were relocated  effectively renewing these leases 
we expect approximately leases to relocate to supercenters in as of december   we have vision centers located in wal mart supercenters 
we believe that wal mart may in the future convert many of its stores and thereby cause many of our leases to start again 
we have received no assurances from wal mart as to how many of their locations will ultimately be converted 
we have previously discussed with wal mart possible amendments to our master license agreement 
the parties have considered various proposals to restructure the master license agreement 
at this time  the parties have not agreed to amend the master license agreement  which remains in effect 
the wal mart leases will accordingly expire as noted in the table below 
the number of lease expirations indicated could decrease if there are future supercenter conversions 
the following table sets forth the number of leases for domestic wal mart and fred meyer vision centers that expire each year  assuming the company exercises all available options to extend the terms of the leases 
this table includes future wal mart superstore conversions which are scheduled at this time 
leases expiring in calendar year host and company thereafter total wal mart fred meyer totals of the six wal mart leases scheduled to expire in  one location was closed in the first quarter of at the end of the original nine year lease term 
the remaining five leases expired on december   which fell in the company s fiscal year these five leases represent annualized sales of approximately million and annualized store level cash flow of approximately million 
in  leases are scheduled to expire over the course of the year  including five closed on december   in the first quarter  five in the second quarter  seven in the third quarter  and eleven in the fourth quarter 
these stores represent annualized sales of approximately million and annualized store level cash flow of approximately million 
store level cash flow excludes corporate overhead and other costs not specifically attributable to individual stores 
the company anticipates that the results of stores which cease operations in will be shown as discontinued operations beginning in as of march   we have closed wal mart vision centers in fiscal we are experiencing declining sales of approximately in the final month of operations for stores that are closing 
we also have incurred store closing costs  including severance related to the thirteen stores closed through march  store closing costs average between  and  per vision center 
as of december   we had vision centers that were operating in the three year extension period of the wal mart lease 
we exercised our option to renew the leases for the three year extension period for wal mart vision centers in the base term for vision centers expires in  and we will need to determine which leases to extend 
we expect to renew the leases for the vast majority of these vision centers 
these decisions will be based on various factors  including sales levels  anticipated future profitability  increased rental fees in the option period  and market share 
other vision centers our agreement with wal mart de mexico provides that each party will not deal with other parties to operate leased department vision centers in mexico 
we have agreed to waive this restriction for the next five stores opened by wal mart de mexico 
this agreement also permits each party to terminate the lease for each vision center which fails to meet minimum sales requirements specified in the agreement 
under our agreement with wal mart de mexico  we have two options for two year renewals  and one option for an additional one year renewal  for each vision center 
our agreement with fred meyer obligates us to exercise our renewal option as to all or none of these locations with the exception of five stores  which are covered by a separate agreement 
this option must be exercised in we are currently discussing possible changes to this agreement with fred meyer 
operating strategies the company s vision is to be the best growth retailer operating in host environments 
to achieve this vision  we are focused on a strategic process  which includes efforts to maximize sales and cash flow from our wal mart stores and other host retail operations  selectively expand store operations in other host environments  and test  develop  and create additional growth opportunities within wal mart 
more specifically  we are actively pursuing this vision through the following three steps step maximize sales and cash flow from our current base stores 
increase profits per store for base stores through same store sales increases and expense control 
shift to a more variable cost structure 
grow store count among existing brands  while continuing to hope for and enjoy vision center conversions to wal mart supercenters  which extends the lease terms of each affected vision center lease 
step grow in the optical industry  but outside our current host stores 
successfully identify and execute on new hosts and or new concepts 
successfully identify and execute on new revenue lines 
step grow inside wal mart  but outside optical 
partner with manufacturers who could benefit from a consultative selling environment for new product introductions inside wal mart 
explore alternative business ideas with wal mart and encourage execution on such ideas 
we cannot provide any assurances as to whether these measures will be successful 
during the second half of and the first quarter of  we implemented numerous changes and initiatives in our existing host stores  which  we believe  will improve our long term operations and profitability for the average store 
such changes and initiatives include the following in july  we changed the in store presentation and pricing strategy of our frame and lens options by unbundling the package prices so that pricing for frames and lenses are separately presented in the store 
the new presentation is more clear  concise and customer friendly and is similar to product and price presentation at optical stores managed by wal mart 
we believe this change has provided a small increase in average spectacle transaction value 
we instituted a partnership initiative with our independent doctors which includes business discussions and goal setting with objectives toward improving the working relationship between the retail optical store and the doctor s practice  as well as improving business results 
this initiative is an ongoing process 
we broadened and improved our offerings related to our fourth quarter contact lens and holiday programs 
during the first half of  we will continue to implement changes and initiatives that  in the opinion of management  will have a favorable long term impact on the operations and profitability of our existing host stores 
some of the anticipated changes and initiatives may be summarized as follows new frame collection improved price points we rolled out a new frame collection in january and february involving a change to of the frames we carry 
through this process  we substantially reduced the number of frame vendors  consolidated certain price points and enhanced the presentation of the frames on the frame boards to make them more brand focused for the customer and easier to manage for our associates 
as a result of this process  we expect to achieve an increase in gross profit margin as a percent of sales and an increase in average transaction value on frame sales 
improvements to store level operations during our annual sales meeting in january  we introduced new improvements in store operating procedures  which include a a code of excellence for all associates with a new training regimen which requires skill practice sessions on a weekly basis  b a revised store compensation plan  which is simpler in concept but shorter in duration  with payouts every two weeks 
c a revised approach to store personnel scheduling based on a pre determined hours matrix targeting required coverage based on store sales volume  d added technology at store level  on an as needed basis to enhance performance  including computer upgrades  voice mail and new printers  and e improved management training for district and region managers 
capitalizing on managed care opportunities during the first quarter of  we neared completion of restructuring our approach to the managed care optical market segment 
in  managed care sales requiring reimbursement by plan payors represented approximately of our domestic retail sales 
industry statistics indicate managed care sales are between and of optical industry sales statistics exclude optometrist examination fees 
the objective of these changes is to put ourselves in a better position to increase our share of sales in this market segment 
we have engaged an outside consulting firm with strong retail experience to assist us in this process 
through this process  the company has also consulted with wal mart  with the goal to explore alternatives that would allow both companies to work together in servicing this market segment 
the components of this revised approach to the managed care segment may be summarized as follows a increase plan participation and plan utilization  which will lead to greater sales growth  b increase participation by our optometrists and improve the teamwork between the optometrists and the retail associates  which will lead to increased plan participation and plan utilization  c develop faster  better  cheaper and easier in store processes  which incorporate personal computer and web based applications for eligibility verification and claims processing  this will enhance participation by our optometrists and lead to improved teamwork at the store level  and d continue improvement to our back office processing environment to accommodate sales growth and to facilitate collections of reimbursement amounts from payors 
we view the managed care market as the best opportunity for enhanced sales growth in our existing retail store operations 
changes to merchandising presentation during  we will review all of our product offerings with an eye toward a improvement of product presentation  b enhancement of the pricing structure  c improvement in product margins  d simplification of associate presentation to customers  and e higher customer satisfaction 
as of the first quarter of  we have completed the rollout of a new accessory collection that adds value to our customers purchasing eyewear 
we plan to make changes to the contact lens inventories stocked in stores in june and july 
in the second half of the year  we plan to test changes to our eyeglass lens offerings  as well 
improvements in store support on an ongoing basis  we continue to review alternatives to improve the way our labs and distribution centers support our stores 
we will continue to pursue such changes in this area if such changes represent an improvement in our efficiency and quality of store support 
we are currently testing taking lensmaking labs out of the stores and providing more cost effective service from our central labs 
we expect to test this in approximately stores by the end of the second quarter 
we cannot provide any assurances as to whether these changes and initiatives will improve our operations or profitability 
we are also looking at new growth opportunities that are similar to our existing optical business and that allow for leveraging existing competencies  capacities and relationships 
these growth opportunities represent new areas in which we do not currently have an operating business 
in order to create new business opportunities  our strategic focus is to leverage existing strengths acquired in operating our host retail optical stores 
the company is considering the creation of a retail business with both a product and service component  consultation from a professional services expert and a store model within a host environment 
we are considering options including health  wellness and beauty related services  which require consultative selling  managed care  and medical competencies and customer support services similar to those required in the optical industry 
as part of our efforts  we are working with wal mart to investigate potential growth vehicles 
we can provide no assurances  however  a that wal mart or any other host operator will permit us to test new concepts in their stores  b that any such test will be successful  or c that we will be able to develop a profitable line of business arising out of any such test 
under the indenture governing the company s senior notes  the company can engage in businesses that are the same  similar or reasonably related to the businesses engaged in by the company as of the date the company emerged from bankruptcy 
in the fourth quarter of  certain holders of the company s senior notes who also own a significant percentage of the company s common stock notified the company that on the basis of this limitation in the indenture  they objected to the company s engaging in lines of business outside of retail vision centers 
the company has engaged in discussions with these holders 
we believe that  to date  the company has complied with the provisions of the indenture  and the company intends to continue to comply with these provisions 
it is possible  however  that the indenture could prohibit the company from engaging in business opportunities it is exploring or may explore in the future  or that there could be a dispute with those bondholders regarding the applicability of those provisions 
these same holders have also objected to the company s repurchase of senior notes outside of the mandatory redemption provisions of the indenture 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the company is operating one hearing center inside one of our wal mart vision centers 
we believe that  consistent with our indenture  we may engage in this line of business 
in the fourth quarter  we initiated a review of the company s retail and support organizations  store and home office processes and the technology that supports both 
as part of our review process  we have engaged an outside consulting firm to assist us 
our initial focus will be on our wal mart vision centers in three areas optimizing store employee and doctor scheduling  simplifying and improving the processing of managed care transactions at the store and in the retail support center  and simplifying and improving the customer order and delivery process 
we expect to begin implementing changes in processes  systems and possibly in staffing levels in the outside consulting firm will also assist us in complying with new requirements under the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa 
we will continue to incur expenses and make capital expenditures in in order to comply with these regulations 
liquidity and capital resources our capital needs have been for operating expenses  capital expenditures  the repayment of principal on the senior subordinated notes and interest expense 
our sources of capital have been cash flow from operations 
it is the company s intent to use excess cash for its ongoing operations  repurchase of notes  and repayment of principal on the company s outstanding debt 
as of march   the company s remaining unused availability under its credit facility with fleet  after being reduced for letter of credit requirements  has increased slightly to approximately million from million at december  at december   the company had no borrowings under its credit facility  and had letters of credit of million outstanding 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and funds available under the credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements through the company made a principal redemption payment on the senior subordinated notes of approximately million on february  to bond holders of record on february  the company also made principal redemption payments of million on august  and million on february  these redemptions are based on the requirements of the indenture and are made at of par 
each principal redemption payment is based on the results for the six month period ending in june or december  respectively 
subsequent to the issuance of the company s financial statements  the company s management determined that certain revisions to the financial statements were required 
all information herein reflects the restated amounts 
an effect of the restatement was to adjust the calculation of working capital under the indenture for purposes of determining the excess cash flow payment for the cumulative period from june  through december  the effect of this adjustment was to increase the cumulative payments of excess cash flow during this same period  by approximately  our indenture expressly provides that  in the event of a restatement which affects a previously made excess cash flow payment  the next payment of excess cash flow otherwise due is appropriately adjusted so that the under or over payment is corrected 
the company accordingly expects that  subject to the minimum cash requirements and other provisions of the indenture  it will increase its next cash flow payment in august by approximately  the company can provide no assurances that such a payment will in fact be made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company made an interest payment of approximately million from existing cash balances on september  the next scheduled interest payment of approximately million was made on friday  march  during the third quarter of  the company s board of directors authorized the company to spend up to million in cash to repurchase in private  unsolicited transactions the company s senior subordinated notes  within a rolling twelve month period 
the initial twelve month rolling period started in august these repurchases have been made on individually negotiated discounts to par 
as of december   the company had repurchased notes with a face value of million for million in cash which included  of accrued interest  resulting in a non cash  extraordinary gain of million 
certain holders of the company s senior notes have objected to these repurchases at a discount 
the company has engaged in discussions with these holders and believes that it has the legal right to continue to repurchase the notes 
the board of directors is evaluating various means of continuing these repurchases 
the company may seek to repurchase notes in private transactions or other means  including a broader offer to the holders  but can give no assurances as to whether such repurchases will take place or as to the timing  duration or amount of any such repurchases 
depending on the nature or amount of these transactions  the company may need the consent of its commercial lender 
in  we opened our th vision center in the domestic wal mart environment  as provided for in our wal mart master license agreement 
in  we do not expect to open additional vision centers in the domestic wal mart environment 
during  we converted wal mart vision centers to supercenters 
in  we expect to convert approximately of our existing wal mart vision centers to supercenters 
each supercenter conversion requires expenditures of approximately  to  the company opened vision centers in host environments other than domestic wal mart during future commitments the table below sets forth the company s contractual obligations payments due by fiscal year thereafter total long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations the company s senior subordinated debt agreement provides for semi annual principal repayments based on the results of operations for the six month periods ended in june and december 
inflation although the company cannot determine the precise effects of inflation  it does not believe inflation has had a material effect on its domestic sales or results of operations 
the company cannot determine whether inflation will have a material long term effect on its sales or results of operations 
as a result of inflation in prior years  the company has in the past adjusted its retail pricing 
further pricing adjustments are contingent upon competitive pricing levels in the marketplace 
management is monitoring the continuing impact of these inflationary trends 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss the consolidated financial statements of national vision  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments and incorporates any changes in such estimates and judgments into the accounting records underlying the company s consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab summarizes the sec s view in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company defers revenue recognition until delivery of the product by estimating the value of transactions in which final delivery to the customer has not occurred at the end of the period presented 
the amount of cash received at the time the customer s order is placed is recorded as a deposit liability and is presented within accrued liabilities 
these estimates are based on historical trends and take into consideration current changes in the company s manufacturing and distribution process 
premium revenue is earned from hmo memberships and services 
revenue from premiums is recognized over the life of the policy as the related services are rendered 
management must make estimates of potential returns and replacements of all or part of the eyewear sold to a customer 
we analyze historical remake and warranty activity  consider current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our estimate of these costs 
differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue and related costs for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
allowance for uncollectible receivables under reimbursement plans managed care accounts receivable are recorded net of contractual allowances and reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
substantially all of the company s receivables are due from health care plans or third party administrators located throughout the united states 
approximately of the company net sales from ongoing businesses relate to products sold to customers that ultimately will be funded in full or in part through private insurance plans  third party insurance administration programs or government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 
failure by the company to accurately file for reimbursement on a timely basis with these programs can have an adverse effect on the company s collection results which  in turn  will have an adverse effect on liquidity and profitability 
estimates of our allowance for uncollectible receivables are based on our historical billing and collection experience 
changes in our billing and collection processes  changes in funding policies by insurance plans and changes in our sales mix within insurance plans may have a material effect on the amount and timing of our estimated expense requirements 
accounting for inventory the company s inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
in most cases  the expected sales value ie  market value of the company s inventory is higher than its cost 
however  as the company progresses through a selling season  certain slow moving merchandise may be removed from stores and returned to the company s distribution center to be sold below cost in secondary markets 
as a result  there is a high degree of judgment and complexity in determining the market value of such inventories 
for inventory on hand  the company estimates the future selling price of its merchandise  given its current selling price and its planned promotional activities  and provides a reserve for the difference between cost and the expected selling price for all items expected to be sold below cost 
the company conducts physical inventory counts for a selection of store locations on a periodic basis through the course of the fiscal year and adjusts the company s records to reflect the actual inventory counts 
inventory in the company s distribution center is counted near the end of the fiscal year 
as all locations are not counted as of the company s reporting dates  the company provides a reserve for inventory shrinkage based principally on historical inventory shrinkage experience 
fresh start accounting in accounting for the effects of the reorganization  the company adopted fresh start accounting principles as contained in the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code sop 
sop was applicable because pre reorganization shareholders received none of the company s new common stock and the reorganization value of the assets of the successor company was less than the total pre petition liabilities allowed plus post petition liabilities 
sop also requires that  at the time of fresh start accounting  the company early adopt all accounting principles that will be required within the twelve months following fresh start accounting 
fresh start accounting principles require that we determine the reorganization value of the reorganized company 
the company s reorganization value was developed by the company  the official committee of unsecured creditors and their respective financial advisors 
the reorganization value was based on a calculation of the present value of the free cash flows under the company s financial projections  including an assumption of a terminal value 
such projections were submitted to the bankruptcy court and to creditors for review and objection as part of the company s disclosure statement accompanying the plan 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets our most significant intangible asset is the intangible value of contractual rights  which was established as part of the company s adoption of fresh start accounting in may this intangible asset  which has a value of million at december   represents the value of the company s lease agreement with wal mart and the business relationship therein created 
in accordance with sfas no 
 this intangible is an amortizable asset because it has a finite useful life 
however  the precise length of its life is not known due primarily to the wal mart superstore conversions that automatically trigger extensions on the contractual life of the asset 
based on our projections  our best estimate of the useful life of this asset is years 
due to the uncertainty involved in predicting the pattern of economic benefits realized from the wal mart relationship  we amortize this asset using the straight line method 
we assess the impairment of all identifiable intangibles and long lived assets on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include a significant underperformance of vision center operations relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of company assets or the strategy for our overall retail optical business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline or adverse change in the rate or geographic concentration of wal mart host store relocations or superstore conversions  and a permanent adverse change in cash flows generated by an operation 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected cash flow model 
if the projected cash flows are not in excess of the book value of the related asset  we measure the impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method 
significant management judgment is required regarding the existence of impairment indicators as discussed above 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that long lived assets or intangible assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
based on our review of our intangible and other long lived assets as of december   no impairment was determined to exist 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as equipment depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
the company emerged from chapter bankruptcy on may  as part of our plan of reorganization  the company s capital structure was highly leveraged with million of senior subordinated notes providing for interest at per annum 
before  during and after the bankruptcy process  the company incurred significant net operating losses nol that result in tax loss carry forwards 
a portion of these carry forwards are subject to limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this nol if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize it to offset future taxes 
we have provided a full valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset because our high leverage will make it difficult for us to become profitable  and our historical high leverage substantially contributed to our failure to achieve profitability 
we currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes for current income 
it is possible  however  that we could be profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the nol carry forward 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nol is utilized 
self insurance accruals we self insure estimated costs associated with workers compensation claims and group medical liabilities  up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established based on actuarial estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  however actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 
other accounting policies the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in selecting any available alternative  which would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires recording costs associated with exit or disposal activities at their fair values when a liability has been incurred 
under previous guidance  certain exit costs were accrued upon management s commitment to an exit plan  which is generally before an actual liability has been incurred 
beginning in fiscal  as vision centers are closed  including lease expirations under the wal mart master license agreement  any costs associated with the closure or disposal will be recorded at fair value when the liability is incurred 
adoption of this statement is required at the beginning of fiscal year in april  the fasb issued sfas no

the provisions of this statement related to the rescission of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies shall be applied in fiscal years beginning after may  with early application encouraged 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
in the beginning of fiscal  which will result in future period gains or losses on extinguishment of debt being presented as other income versus as extraordinary items 
risk factors this form k contains a number of statements about the future 
it also contains statements which involve assumptions about the future 
all these statements are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements represent our expectations or belief concerning future events  including any statements regarding future sales levels  the continuation of historical trends  and the company s liquidity 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we do not know whether the forward looking statements made in this form k will prove to be correct 
we have tried to identify factors which may cause these statements to be incorrect  but we may not have identified all of them 
these factors could also have a negative impact on our results 
the following is our non exclusive list of these factors our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our notes 
as a result of the issuance of our notes  we are highly leveraged 
the notes are subordinated to our credit facility 
assuming the issuance of all of our notes and after giving effect to the establishment of our credit facility  we had as of march  total indebtedness of million represented by the notes  and total availability of million under our credit facility  after letter of credit requirements 
our ability to pay or refinance our indebtedness  including our ability to repay the notes  or to fund capital expenditures will depend on our future performance 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based upon our current level of operations  we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash  and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next two years 
a decrease in revenues  coupled with the borrowing base limitation contained in our credit facility  could require us to postpone capital expenditures 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that revenue growth will be realized or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness  including the notes  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the notes  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt  and limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  our ability to borrow additional funds 
our failure to comply with the covenants in the indenture under which our notes were issued or our credit facility would result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
a substantial number of our vision centers are located in wal mart stores 
our ability to continue to generate revenue depends on our continued relationship with wal mart 
in connection with our emergence from chapter reorganization  we sold all of our free standing vision centers 
we are substantially dependent on wal mart and its affiliates for our current operations 
the following chart shows  as of december   the number of our vision centers that are in wal mart stores and the total number of our vision centers category number total vision centers wal mart locations wal mart de mexico in addition  vision centers located in wal mart stores accounted for substantially all of the earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of our vision centers for the fiscal year ended december  vision centers in wal mart stores rely largely on customer traffic generated by the wal mart host store 
our agreement with wal mart does not require wal mart to maintain any existing wal mart store or to open new ones 
our agreement with wal mart gives us the right to open at least vision centers  including those already open 
we have reached that number 
wal mart is under no obligation to provide us with additional vision center leases 
however  our agreement with wal mart also provides that  if wal mart converts its own store to a supercenter  which is a store that contains a grocery department in addition to the traditional wal mart store offering  and relocates our vision center as part of the conversion  the term of our lease begins again 
we believe that wal mart may in the future convert many of its stores and thereby cause many of our leases to start again 
there were conversions of wal mart stores in which we run vision centers into supercenters in the year  and of these conversions prior to we have received no assurances from wal mart as to how many of their locations will ultimately be converted 
our agreement with wal mart provides for a nine year base term at each vision center that begins at opening and gives us a three year extension option 
wal mart is under no obligation to provide us with any further extensions 
forty four vision centers have base terms that expired in under our wal mart agreement  substantially all of which have been extended  and another have base terms that expire in  which we have the option to extend 
more base terms will expire in subsequent years 
as each base term expires  we determine whether to exercise our three year extension options for our wal mart vision centers 
we make those decisions based upon various factors  including  for example the sales levels of each vision center  the estimated future profitability of each vision center  and the increased minimum license fees charged by wal mart during the option period 
we must exercise our extension option for any wal mart vision center at least six months before its initial license expires 
we expect to extend the licenses for a substantial majority of these vision centers 
we cannot assure you  however  how many licenses we will actually extend 
in each of the next several years  increasing numbers of vision centers under our wal mart agreement will have their base terms expire 
our rental obligations to wal mart will increase in the three year option period 
we will need to continue to improve sales at these vision centers 
if we do not  our rent as a percent of sales will increase significantly during the option period 
alternatively  we may choose not to exercise the extension options 
we cannot control our expansion in our host stores  including wal mart  beyond those currently under contract 
although we periodically discuss expansion opportunities with each host  we cannot assure you that any host will offer to extend our current agreements or offer us additional vision centers 
nor can we assure you that any renewal or new store offer will be on terms similar to those in our current agreements 
wal mart operates its own optical division 
wal mart may  in the future  allocate its future vision centers entirely to its own optical division 
our pursuit of other lines of business could be constrained by the terms of our indenture 
the indenture governing our senior notes limits our operations to those which are the same  similar or reasonably related to the businesses in which we were engaged as of the date we emerged from bankruptcy 
we are in the process of opening several hearing aid centers in wal mart stores 
we are also investigating other concepts  such as wellness centers  which would offer various health products and services 
our indenture could limit our ability to pursue certain of these other lines of business that might otherwise be attractive to us 
in addition  certain holders of our notes have objected to our engaging in these lines of business 
although we believe that we are in compliance with the indenture and intend to continue to comply with the indenture  we can give no assurance that these holders might not seek to declare a default arising out of our engaging in these lines of business 
our financial performance may be adversely affected by sales recorded at vision centers scheduled to close under the wal mart agreement 
we have observed sharp declines in sales levels as our vision centers come to the end of their lease term under the wal mart agreement 
in fiscal  we expect to close approximately vision centers under our wal mart agreement 
we expect to close approximately vision centers in fiscal under the wal mart agreement 
in the months prior to their scheduled date of closure  these vision centers could record substantial sales declines 
the extent of the sales declines  coupled with the number of vision centers nearing the end of their lease term  could have a negative impact on our sales and on our profitability 
we have recently made substantial changes to the inventory we carry and the vendors we use  we could  as a result  have a greater risk of write offs of inventory and disruption to our retail operations 
we have recently changed our frame offering at our retail locations and have also substantially reduced the number of vendors from whom we buy our products 
this change of product creates the risk of write off of inventory which has become obsolete 
in addition  the new flow of products within our system could create administrative problems which would disrupt our retail operations 
we may incur additional expenditures to replace older optometric equipment and thereby create additional pressure on liquidity 
some of the optometric equipment in our vision centers is older and will need to be replaced 
we may need to make significant cash expenditures to replace this equipment 
the military action in iraq could have a negative impact on our operations  particularly those on military bases 
we have approximately vision centers on military bases in the united states 
the military action in iraq could have a negative impact on these vision centers 
our lack of growth could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our note  and the price of our common stock 
average revenues in our wal mart vision centers are approximately  per center per year 
average revenues in the other vision centers that we continue to own are less than  per center per year 
the expiration of our leases with wal mart will cause a reduction in our revenues  which we may not be able to replace with revenues generated by other vision centers 
our sales revenues could decrease in the future as wal mart leases expire 
it is unlikely that we will be able to open enough new vision centers under our fred meyer and military contracts to compensate for the loss of the revenues generated by wal mart vision centers for which our leases expire 
we expect that our expenses  however  will increase over time 
a combination of lower sales and higher expenses would adversely affect our ability to repay or refinance our notes  which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
the use of net operating loss carry forwards may be subject to limitations 
in conjunction with our historical results from operations  emergence from chapter and the disposition of our free standing operations  we incurred significant net operating losses 
these losses resulted in significant net operating loss carry forwards 
our ability to utilize our net operating losses that were realized prior to our emergence from chapter is limited under section of the internal revenue code of if our net operating losses realized after our emergence from chapter are subject to substantial limitation because of a future change of control of the company or for other reasons  our cash tax costs would increase and have an adverse effect on our ability to repay the notes 
if  after such a change of control  we determined that we would be unable to utilize this tax asset  we could then be forced to write down the asset and record a charge against our financial results 
your right to receive payments on our notes will be junior to our borrowings under our credit facility  which could adversely affect our ability to pay off the notes 
our indebtedness under our credit facility is secured by liens against substantially all of our assets 
in the event of a default on our secured indebtedness  or a bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization of the company and our subsidiaries  these assets will be available to satisfy obligations with respect to the secured indebtedness before they can be used to satisfy our obligations under our notes 
the terms of our credit facility and the indenture under which our notes were issued restrict our corporate activities 
our credit facility contains various restrictive covenants and requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial tests  such as minimum requirements of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization in our credit facility of million for the four fiscal quarters ending june  and for each four quarter period ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter for the remainder of the term of our credit facility  and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios of to our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you we will meet these tests 
in addition  our credit facility and our indenture limit our ability to take action with respect to capital expenditures  investments  indebtedness  liens  dividends  loans  prepayments of other indebtedness  mergers  acquisitions or sales of assets  changes in business activities see risk factors our pursuit of other lines of business could be constrained by the terms of our indenture  transactions with affiliates  and issuance of equity 
our breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility 
if a default occurs  our lender can declare our indebtedness  both principal and interest  immediately due and payable  and could terminate its commitment to make future advances 
in addition  a default under the indenture could cause the principal and accrued interest on the notes to become due and payable 
the restrictions in the indenture and the credit facility will likely restrict our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures or general corporate purposes 
our indebtedness requires substantial debt service payments and  with respect to the indenture  mandatory redemptions of principal  which may restrict our ability to use our operating cash flow for capital expenditures and other working capital requirements 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets under our credit facility and under the indenture 
if we fail to repay all amounts declared due and payable  our lender and then the holders of our notes could proceed against the collateral granted to it to satisfy our obligations 
it is likely that our assets would be insufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness  including the notes 
we are required by our indenture to make mandatory redemptions of principal owing on our notes if we generate excess cash flow  which may have an adverse impact on our common stock 
the indenture requires mandatory redemptions of principal out of the excess cash flow that we may generate biannually 
there can be no assurances that we will generate enough excess cash flow to make any mandatory redemptions 
prepayments of principal on the notes  if any  will prevent us from having excess cash to reinvest in our business  and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
further issuances of our common stock and our notes could adversely affect their trading prices 
we issued a total of  shares of our common stock and  aggregate principal amount of our notes to creditors pursuant to our plan of reorganization 
as of the march   some of the shares of common stock and notes have been held in reserve for distribution to creditors upon the resolution of claims that we have disputed in the bankruptcy court 
although no issuances of securities other than pursuant to our plan of reorganization are currently contemplated except grants of stock options or other stock awards pursuant to employee benefit plans that are in place further issuances of our common stock and notes in the future could take place 
these issuances could cause adverse changes in the trading prices of the common stock and the notes 
the holders of our common stock may exercise significant control over us 
former holders of our old senior notes due held a large majority of our unsecured debt in bankruptcy  and thus are the initial holders of a majority of our common stock 
if holders of significant numbers of shares of our common stock act as a group  these holders could be in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors 
certain of these holders have already objected to our repurchase of notes and our pursuit of other business opportunities 
holders of our common stock and our notes may elect to sell large blocks of common stock or notes  which may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and our notes 
our former unsecured creditors received our common stock and our notes in exchange for their claims against us 
some or all of the holders of our common stock and notes may prefer to liquidate their investment rather than hold the securities on a long term basis 
the possibility that one or more of the holders of significant numbers of shares of our common stock or a large principal amount of our notes may determine to sell all or a large portion of their shares of our common stock or their notes in a short period of time may adversely affect the market price of the common stock or notes 
partially for that reason  there can be no assurance as to the degree of price volatility in any trading market that may develop for the common stock and the notes 
as a result  no assurance can be given that any holder of our common stock or our notes will be able to sell them or at what price any sale may occur 
no assurance can be given as to the market price  if any  that will prevail for our common stock in the future 
if a market were to exist for our notes  they may trade at prices higher or lower than their face value  depending upon many factors  including  without limitation  the prevailing interest rates  markets for similar securities  industry conditions and the performance of  and investor expectations for us 
our common stock and our notes have all been issued but not distributed 
further distributions will be made pursuant to the bankruptcy plan as disputed claims are resolved 
distributions of our common stock and our notes to holders who decide to sell them immediately could cause sudden adverse changes in the trading prices of our common stock and our notes 
our common stock may be delisted from the american stock exchange  referred to as the amex  if it does not maintain certain listing standards 
our recent operating history  including our filing of and emergence from chapter  has caused the price of our securities to be depressed 
in addition  the general market for securities has been severely depressed in recent quarters 
the price of our common stock has declined significantly since its original listing date 
the rules of the amex allow the exchange to delist securities if the amex determines that a company s securities fail to meet guidelines with respect to corporate net worth  public float  number of shareholders  the aggregate market value of shares  or price per share 
in light of our recent operating history specifically  and the market conditions for stocks in general  we cannot assure purchasers of our common stock or notes that we will continue to meet the requirements of the amex 
if we are unable to continue to satisfy these criteria  the amex may begin procedures to remove our common stock or notes from the exchange 
if our common stock or notes are delisted  a trading market may no longer exist  and the ability of shareholders to buy and sell common stock or notes may be materially impaired 
we have received a letter from amex concerning our failure to timely file our reports under the securities laws  including this form k 
the letter states that  if we are not current in our filings by june   the exchange may seek to delist or halt trading in our securities 
our form q for the first quarter of has not been filed 
although we intend to file this form in the near term  we cannot guarantee that we will file the form q by june  and that amex will not seek to delist or halt trading in our securities 
we have not declared dividends in the past  and do not anticipate doing so in the near future  which may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our credit facility and our indenture prohibit the payment of cash dividends without the consent of the lender and the holders of the notes  respectively 
we have never declared or paid any dividend on our capital stock 
we currently anticipate that all of our earnings  if any  will be retained for payment of the principal amount of the notes  and then for development of our business  and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
a change in interest rates could adversely affect us 
we have historically borrowed long term debt under our credit facility at variable interest rates 
we therefore incur the risk of increased interest costs if interest rates rise 
the retail eyecare industry is extremely competitive 
failure to attract customers will depress our earning and may adversely affect our ability to repay the notes and the price of our common stock 
the retail eyecare industry is extremely competitive 
we compete with national companies such as lenscrafters and cole  we also compete with numerous regional and local firms 
in addition  optometrists  ophthalmologists  and opticians provide many of the same goods and services we provide 
the level and intensity of competition can vary dramatically depending on the particular market 
we believe that we have numerous competitive advantages  such as our everyday low pricing  product selection  and quality and consistency of service 
we also compete for managed care business 
our competition for this business is principally the larger national and regional optical firms 
competition for this business is driven by size of provider network  quality and consistency of service  and by pricing of vision care services 
successful renewals of certain existing third party contracts are integral to maintaining sales revenues 
several of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to engage in extensive and prolonged price promotions which may adversely affect our business 
they may also be able spend more than we do for advertising 
if we are not able to maintain our market share of the retail optical industry  our business will suffer 
a decline in our earnings could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the notes  and our ability to repay the notes 
federal and state governments extensively regulate the health care and insurance industries 
a finding that we have violated existing regulations  or future adverse changes in those regulations  could negatively affect our business and its prospects  our ability to repay the notes  and the price of our common stock and our notes 
both federal and state governments extensively regulate the delivery of health care  including relationships among health care providers such as optometrists and eyewear providers like us 
many states prohibit business corporations from practicing medicine or controlling the medical judgments or decisions of physicians 
states often also prohibit various financial arrangements  such as splitting fees with physicians 
the legality of our relationships with opticians and independent optometrists has been and may be challenged from time to time 
regulations vary from state to state and are enforced by both courts and regulatory authorities  each with broad discretion 
a ruling that we have violated these laws could  for example  result in censure  delicensing of optometrists  civil or criminal penalties  including large civil monetary penalties  invalidation or modification of our agreements with optometrists and opticians  or an order requiring us to change our business practices 
these consequences could have an adverse effect on our business  which could impact the price of our common stock and notes and impact our ability to repay the notes 
also  changes in our relationships with independent optometrists and opticians could adversely affect our relationship with wal mart or our other host stores 
local ordinances such as zoning requirements can also impose significant burdens and costs of compliance 
frequently  our competitors sit on state and local boards 
our risks and costs of compliance are often increased as a result 
all of these matters could cause our business to suffer  our ability to repay the notes to be adversely affected  and the trading price of our common stock and notes to decline 
in california  optometrists who practice adjacent to our retail locations are providers to and subtenants of a subsidiary  which is licensed as a single source hmo 
this subsidiary is regulated by the department of managed health care 
this agency has recently required that we change our way of doing business 
this new way of doing business will increase our costs in california 
on a general basis  the regulatory environment in california has become more difficult  and future actions of regulatory agencies or private parties could worsen this trend 
such actions could force us to change the way we do business  to incur significant expense in litigation and compliance efforts  and could have a material adverse impact on us 
the fraud and abuse provisions of the social security act and anti kickback laws and regulations adopted in many states prohibit soliciting  paying  receiving or offering any compensation for making  or causing someone to make  referrals of patients  items or services in some circumstances 
the social security act also imposes significant penalties for false or improper medicare and medicaid billings 
many states have adopted similar laws applicable to any payor of health care services 
we must also comply with federal laws such as the health insurance portability and accountability act of which governs our participation in managed care programs and the food and drug administration act which regulates medical devices such as contact lenses 
in addition  the stark self referral law restricts referrals for medicare or medicaid covered services where the referring physician has a financial relationship with the service provider 
in some cases  the rental of space constitutes a financial relationship under this law 
many states have adopted similar self referral laws which are not limited to medicare or medicaid reimbursed services 
violations of these laws may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties  including double and treble civil monetary penalties  and in the case of federal laws  exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
these kinds of exclusions and penalties  if applied to us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  which could adversely affect the price of our common stock and our notes  and our ability to repay the notes 
we do not have employment agreements with key management 
the departure of key executives could adversely affect our business 
we depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
the departure of these individuals in significant numbers could adversely affect our business and prospects if we are unable to attract and retain qualified replacements 
we do not currently have employment agreements with any personnel  including key executive officers and management 
however  we offer our executives and management bonus and stock based incentives related to our performance 
failure to have independent vision care professionals available in or near our vision centers would adversely affect our ability to win managed care and host store contracts  and could prevent us from operating in some states 
our business and marketing strategies emphasize the availability of independent optometrists in close proximity to our vision centers 
typically  we contract with at least one licensed optometrist to occupy a space in or adjacent to each of our stores 
additionally  our agreement with wal mart contemplates that we will make optometrists available at least hours per week if permitted by law 
some states require that licensed opticians be present when eyeglasses or contact lenses are fitted or dispensed 
in some markets it may be difficult for us to attract and retain optometrists if our vision centers generate low sales 
any difficulties or delays in securing the services of vision care professionals could adversely affect our business and our relationship with our host stores 
consequences of difficulty or delay could include termination of our host store licenses for those vision centers  and imposition of legal sanctions against us  including closure of vision centers without licensed professionals 
our retail business may suffer if we fail to keep sufficient licensed optometrists available in our vision centers  which may adversely affect our ability to repay our notes and the price of our common stock and notes 
historically  if there is no licensed optometrist available to give eye exams  our retail business has suffered 
in some markets  it can be difficult to hire or keep vision care professionals on staff in our vision centers 
failure to maintain a staff of qualified vision care professionals may cause our customers to go elsewhere to provide for their optical needs  which would have an adverse effect on our business 
our success increasingly depends on our ability to develop and maintain relationships with managed vision care companies 
an increasing percentage of patients receive health care coverage through managed care payors 
as this trend continues  our success will increasingly depend on our ability to negotiate contracts with health maintenance organizations referred to as hmos  employer groups and other private third party payors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish or maintain satisfactory relationships with managed care and other third party payors 
many managed care payors have existing provider structures in place that they may be unable or unwilling to change 
our inability to enter into arrangements with managed care payors in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have established a network of optometrists and other providers located in or adjacent to our stores in order to enhance our ability to contract with managed care payors for both professional services and retail eyewear supplies 
currently  approximately of our revenues are received from managed care payors 
we expect this percentage to increase in the future 
managed care contracts include a variety of reimbursement methods  such as capitation and fee for service or discounts 
our contracts with managed care companies on the one hand  and with networks of optometrists and other providers on the other  are subject to federal and state regulations  for example insurance licensure 
most states impose strict licensure requirements on companies that engage in the business of insurance  including health insurance companies and hmos 
many licensing laws mandate strict financial and other requirements which we may not be able to meet  were we deemed to be engaging in the business of insurance 
additionally  the licensure process can be lengthy and time consuming 
antitrust laws 
a range of antitrust laws apply to us and our provider network 
these laws prohibit anti competitive conduct  including price fixing  concerted refusals to deal  and divisions of markets 
we cannot assure you that our operations will not be challenged on antitrust grounds in the future 
proposed reforms may affect our earnings and may adversely affect our business 
there have been numerous reform initiatives at the federal and state levels relating to the payment for and availability of healthcare services 
we believe that these initiatives will continue for the foreseeable future 
if adopted  some of these reforms could adversely affect our earnings  and may adversely affect our business 
we rely on third parties to pay many of our customers costs 
a significant portion of medical care in the united states is funded by government and private insurance programs  such as medicare  medicaid and corporate health insurance plans 
according to government projections  more medical beneficiaries who are significant consumers of eye care services will enroll in managed care organizations 
governmental and private third party payors are trying to contain medical costs by lowering reimbursements  imposing use restrictions and risk based compensation arrangements  redesigning benefits  and exploring more cost effective methods of health care delivery 
these cost containment efforts may lead to limitations or reductions in reimbursement for eye care services  which would adversely affect our future sales 
additionally  some reimbursement programs require us to collect payment from third party payors 
our inability to fully collect reimbursable amounts could adversely affect cash flow generated from operations 
we depend on reliable and timely reimbursement of claims we submit to third party payors 
there are risks we may not be paid on a timely basis  or that we will be paid at all 
some plans have complex forms to complete 
sometimes our staff may incorrectly complete forms  delaying our reimbursement 
these delays can hurt our cash flow and also force us to write off more of these accounts receivable 
new advances may reduce the need for our products or allow other manufacturers to produce eyewear at lower cost than we can 
technological advances in the eyecare industry  such as new surgical procedures or medical devices  could reduce the demand for our products 
corneal refractive surgery procedures such as laser surgery  radial keratotomy and photo refractive keratectomy may change the demand for our products 
the development of new drugs may have a similar effect 
technological advances such as wafer technology and lens casting may make our current lens manufacturing method uncompetitive or obsolete 
the number of individuals electing lasik and similar surgical procedures has dramatically increased each year  which could significantly decrease demand for our goods and services 
these and other medical and technological advances may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
a prolonged economic downturn could have an adverse impact on us 
we believe that a weakening economy may cause an increase in the period of time between repurchases of our retail products by the average consumer  since customers may see replacement purchases of eyeglasses and contact lenses as non essential 
an extension of the repurchase cycle for our retail products would reduce the number of sales of our retail products 
lower sales of our retail products would reduce our revenues  which could adversely affect both our ability to pay off the notes and the price of our common stock and notes 
operating in other countries presents special risks that may affect our results of operations 
our mexican operations face risks substantially similar to those we face in our wal mart stores  including dependence on the host store and limits on expansion 
we cannot assure you that our mexican operations will be able to attain profitability 
our foreign operations expose us to all of the risks of investing and operating in foreign countries generally  including differing regulatory  political and governmental environments  currency fluctuations  high inflation  price controls  restrictions on profit repatriation  generally lower per capita income and spending levels  import duties and value added taxes  and difficulties of cross cultural marketing 
our articles of incorporation  by laws  indenture  and shareholder rights agreement contain provisions that make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company  which may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws could discourage tender offers or other transactions that would result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for our common stock 
these include provisions authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval  requiring a supermajority shareholder vote in various circumstances  restricting who may call a special meeting of shareholders  permitting our board of directors to consider constituencies in addition to the shareholders  and requiring shareholders to comply with various procedures in connection with any shareholder proposals or director nominations 
the indenture governing our senior notes provides that  upon a change of control as defined  the company is obligated to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at par 
a change of control is defined to include  among other things  the acquisition by a group of or more of our common stock  and the election of a majority of directors who was not approved by a majority of the prior directors 
our shareholder rights agreement provides us with a defensive mechanism that decreases the risk that a hostile acquirer will attempt to take control of us without negotiating directly with our board of directors 
it is meant to prevent an acquirer from gaining control of us by paying an inadequate price or by using coercive techniques 
the shareholder rights agreement may discourage acquirers from attempting to purchase us  which may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the change of control repurchase contemplated by our indenture 
upon some changes of control of the company  holders of our notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes 
if a change of control occurs  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to repurchase all of the notes tendered 
our failure to repurchase tendered notes would be an event of default under our indenture 
changes of control are also restricted by  and constitute a default under  our credit facility 
if the lender under our credit facility were to accelerate our obligations due to a default  it would have a priority claim to the proceeds from the sale of our assets that secure the credit facility 
our adoption of fresh start accounting may make evaluating our financial position and results of operations  as compared to prior periods  more difficult 
due to our emergence from bankruptcy pursuant to our plan of reorganization  we implemented fresh start accounting as of june  in accordance with fresh start accounting  all assets and liabilities were restated to reflect their respective fair values 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements for our reorganized company starting on and going forward from june  will not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements for the periods prior to june  the change in our accounting principles may make it more difficult to compare our operations to prior periods 
our operating history since our emergence from bankruptcy may be insufficient to evaluate our financial condition based on our financial statements 
our operating history since we emerged from bankruptcy is limited 
our financial statements since the implementation of fresh start accounting may be insufficient to draw proper conclusions about our future ability to generate profits and to make payments on the notes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and the risk of unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the mexican peso 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management  which reviews and approves the company s risk management policies 
we manage market risk on the basis of an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
the company s financial advisors  both internal and external  provide ongoing advice regarding trends that affect management s assessment 
company s operations are not considered to give rise to significant market risk 
interest rate risk the company borrows long term debt under our credit facility at variable interest rates 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
we therefore incur the risk of increased interest costs if interest rates rise 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under its credit facility 
the company s interest cost under its senior notes is fixed at through the expiration date of the senior notes  due foreign currency risk the company s division in mexico operates in a functional currency other than the us dollar 
the net assets of this division are exposed to foreign currency translation gains and losses  which are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity 
such translation resulted in unrealized losses of  in and unrealized income of  in historically  the company has not attempted to hedge this equity risk
