item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act if  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements for purposes of these provisions  including any statements regarding projections of earnings  revenues or other financial items  plans and objectives of management for future operations  future expenditures  proposed new products or services and their development schedule  industry  technological or market trends  our ability to address the need for application specific logic products  our ability to respond rapidly to customer needs  expanding product sales  future economic conditions or performance  and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as may  will  expects  plans  anticipates  estimates  potential  or continue  or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements contained herein are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such expectations or any of the forward looking statements will prove to be correct  and actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are set forth herein under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
all forward looking statements and reasons why results may differ included in this annual report are made as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statement or reason why actual results may differ 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be reasonable given the circumstances 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies are critical as defined by the securities and exchange commission  in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make difficult judgements and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we also have other important policies that are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon shipment  provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured 
a provision for estimated future returns and other charges against revenue is recorded at the time of shipment 
approximately of our sales are to distributors 
we have agreements for price adjustment and stock rotation programs with our distributors 
the revenue we record for sales to our distributors is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net revenue  we must make significant judgements and estimates 
our estimates are based on historical experience rates  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current trends and other related factors 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results depend on our ability to make reliable estimates and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost which generally approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we record charges for excess and obsolete inventory based on inventory age  shipment history and our forecast of demand over a specific future period 
table of contents of time 
actual market conditions in the volatile semiconductor markets that we serve may vary from our forecast or other assumptions  potentially impacting our assessment of excess and obsolete inventory resulting in material effects on our gross margin 
investments 
pericom adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  for its fiscal year beginning july accordingly  we ceased amortizing goodwill with a net carrying value of  and annual amortization of  that resulted from business combinations initiated prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
also requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually 
we determined that no impairment of this goodwill existed in fiscal  and we will continue to evaluate such goodwill at least annually 
we also made other investments in fiscal including bridge loans convertible to equity as well as direct equity investments 
these investments are included in other long term assets in our balance sheet and are carried at the lower of cost  or market if the investment has experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
we monitor these investments quarterly and make appropriate reductions in carrying value if a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
overview pericom semiconductor corporation was incorporated in june we completed our first profitable fiscal year on june  we design  manufacture and market high performance digital  analog and mixed signal integrated circuits used for the transfer  routing  and timing of digital and analog signals within and between computer  networking  data communications and telecommunications systems 
our first volume sales occurred in fiscal and consisted exclusively of volt bit interface logic circuits 
since then we have expanded our product offering by introducing the following products  among others in fiscal  volt bit logic circuits and bit digital switches  in fiscal  clock generators  volt clock synthesizers and buffers  and high speed interface products for the networking industry in fiscal  in fiscal  bit logic  bit digital switches and pentium  k modem and laser printer clock synthesizers  in fiscal  an analog switch family  mixed voltage logic and a family of clock generators  in fiscal  a family of advanced volt cmos logic  timing devices for pentium and pentium ii mobile computers  a complete solution for the pc memory module standard  and a volt bus switch family offering the fastest bus switches on the market  in fiscal  three families of volt zero delay clock drivers for the networking and telecommunications markets  a family of application specific bus switches and integrated clock generators to support the latest intel processors and a complete interface solution for the pc memory module standard  in fiscal  a crossbar switch for backplane applications like server clusters  networking  industrial computing and storage area networks  a family of drivers  receivers  and transceivers supporting the low voltage differential signaling interface standard  the superclock programmable skew timing product family targeting networking  telecommunications and storage area network applications  a complete interface solution for the new double data rate ddr sdram memory standard  a family of lvds cross point switches to route signals in oc networks  and the avc family of high speed interface logic  
table of contents in fiscal  a volt switch products and complementary complete timing interface solution for use in double data rate ddr synchronous dram modules  lvds products for the networking market including both dual and quad crosspoint switches for both point to point and bus communications  several hot plug switches that support the growing demand for operations  expansion of the volt avc family  and low voltage bus switch products that provide volt to volt and volt to volt level translation  in fiscal  advanced avc products that allow voltage shifting between volts and volts and i o translation from hstl to lvttl commonly needed between the latest state of the art asics and other legacy products  enhancements to our ddr memory module solutions  active termination clamp that help to clean up signaling overshoot common at fast clock rates  additional family of seven analog multiplexers and switches with improved performance  which are used in a wide range of space constrained mobile and handheld computing applications  and a family of single  dual  and triple gate logic devices in extremely small packaging that address a very broad range of applications and systems requirements  and in fiscal  a family of intel compatible pci bridge products that offer higher margins  v low r on ohm general purpose switches  support for ddr i at mhz and mhz plus our first ddr ii products  gigabit lan switch used in notebook computers  vcxo for set top boxes and dsl products  and we expanded our standard logic product line 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we expect selling prices for our products to decline over the life of each product 
our ability to increase net revenues is highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices of existing products 
we seek to increase unit sales volume through increased wafer fabrication capacity allocations from our existing foundries  qualification of new foundries  increased number of die per wafer through die size reductions and improved yields of good die through the implementation of advanced process technologies  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
in fiscal  and  respectively  approximately   and of the wafers for our semiconductor products were manufactured by chartered semiconductor manufacturing 
we qualified ams as a wafer supplier in fiscal  njrc in fiscal  tsmc in fiscal and hyundai hynix in declining selling prices will adversely affect gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with the sale of new higher margin products or achieve commensurate reductions in unit costs 
we seek to improve our overall gross margin through the development and introduction of selected new products that we believe will ultimately achieve higher gross margins 
a higher gross margin for a new product is typically not achieved until some period after the initial introduction of the product after start up expenses for that product have been incurred and once volume production begins 
in general  costs are higher at the introduction of a new product due to the use of a more generalized design schematic  lower economies of scale in the assembly phase and lower die yield 
our ability to decrease unit cost depends on our ability to shrink the die sizes of our products  improve yields  obtain favorable subcontractor pricing  and make in house manufacturing operations more productive and efficient 
there can be no assurance that these efforts  even if successful  will be sufficient to offset declining selling prices 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended june  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charge total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss comparison of fiscal  and net revenues 
net revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in net revenues resulted primarily from a rapid decline in weighted average selling prices and continued reductions of inventory levels in the distribution and contract manufacturing sales channels 
net revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in net revenues from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from the prolonged worldwide semiconductor industry downturn and a decline in the weighted average selling prices of our products 
the rapid semiconductor industry downturn that began in fiscal also caused an over supply of inventories in the global distribution and contract manufacturing sales channels 
this inventory imbalance pushed order rates down  caused a corresponding drop in backlog and caused the percentage of net sales represented by orders placed and shipped in the same quarter to grow 
these orders are called turns orders 
with reduced backlog and increased reliance on turns orders  there is more uncertainty in the company s ability to predict near term revenue levels 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased slightly from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margin increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal the slight increase in gross margin was largely due to significant nonrecurring inventory write downs recorded in fiscal the level of inventory reserves recorded in fiscal was significantly less than in fiscal excluding the inventory reserve charges in fiscal  product margins actually declined from fiscal to fiscal due primarily to declines in weighted average selling prices 
gross profit decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin resulted from decreases in the average selling prices of our various product lines and from under absorption of factory overhead due to reduced unit volumes 
these decreases were partially offset by cost reductions achieved through reduced wafer  assembly and test costs 
future gross profit and gross margins are highly dependent on the amount and product mix of turns orders 
because of this  the company is not able to predict future gross profit levels or gross margins with certainty 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal research and development expenses increased 
table of contents from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  research and development increased from in fiscal to in fiscal in we continued our commitment to new product development and at the same time realized certain efficiencies that resulted in a slight decrease in absolute dollars of research and development spending as compared with as a percentage of net revenues  research and development increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in research and development spending from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to development costs for new products in each of our product lines and  to a lesser extent  expansion of engineering staff and related infrastructure 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives  and as a result we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  human resources and general management 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal but increased as a percentage of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the expense decrease was primarily due to decreased staffing levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but increased as a percentage of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the expense decrease was primarily due to decreased staffing levels and decreases in commissions and other incentives resulting from the decline in sales and profitability 
the company anticipates that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods over the long term due to increased staffing levels  particularly in sales and marketing  as well as increased commission expense to the extent the company achieves higher sales levels 
in the short term  the company intends to continue to focus on controlling costs until business conditions improve 
if business conditions deteriorate or the rate of improvement does not meet our goals  the company may implement further cost cutting actions 
restructuring charge 
in fiscal there was a restructuring charge of million related to an unused leased facility 
this restructuring charge is sufficient to cover the costs of the facility through the term of the lease 
there was also a restructuring charge of  in fiscal related to the same facility 
there were no restructuring charges in fiscal other income  net 
other income  net includes interest income and expense  investment write offs and our allocated portion of net losses of pericom technology  inc pti  a british virgin islands corporation based in shanghai  people s republic of china 
pti was formed by pericom and certain pericom shareholders in to develop and market semiconductors in china and certain other asian countries see note of notes to financial statements 
other income  net increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to declines in short term interest rates 
our share in the net losses of pti decreased from million in fiscal to  in fiscal as the market conditions in china have improved 
in addition  we wrote off investments totaling million in fiscal other income  net decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal interest income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to declines in short term interest rates 
our share in the net losses of pti increased from  excluding  in goodwill amortization  in fiscal to million in fiscal as pti s losses increased due to the global semiconductor industry downturn 
in addition  we wrote off million in investments in fiscal no investments were written off in fiscal provision for income taxes 
the income tax benefit in fiscal was million as compared with a benefit of million in fiscal the income tax benefit in fiscal was million as compared with a provision of million in fiscal the income tax benefit in fiscal and fiscal were the result of the carry back of the net loss in each year to prior fiscal years 
the provision for income taxes differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes  the utilization of research and development tax credits and a change in the deferred asset valuation allowance 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided approximately million in cash in fiscal  million in cash in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to inventories increasing by  in fiscal while inventories decreased million in fiscal the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the net loss of million for fiscal compared to net income of million for fiscal for fiscal our cash flows provided by operating activities were the result of the net loss of million as offset by depreciation and amortization of million  investment write offs of million  our share of the net loss of pti of  a decrease of million in accounts receivable  an increase of  in inventory and an increase in accrued liabilities of net cash used for investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used for investing activities from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to net purchases of short term investments decreasing from a net purchase of million in fiscal to a net maturity of million in fiscal the increase in net cash used for investing activities from fiscal to was primarily due to net purchases of short term investments increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we made capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal financing activities used  in cash in fiscal and provided approximately million in cash in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities resulted from the repurchase of common stock offset in part by the issuance of common stock from employee stock plans 
in fiscal and  cash flows from financing activities resulted from the issuance of common stock  from employee stock plans 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by million to million on june  from million on june  the decrease was primarily due to our investment in saronix llc 
we believe that cash generated from operations and existing cash balances will be sufficient to fund necessary purchases of capital equipment and leasehold improvements  to fund our repurchase of common stock and to provide working capital at least through the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that future events will not require us to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that adequate capital will be available at all or on terms acceptable to us 
our board of directors has approved the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock 
as of september   we have repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
for example  we have signed a definitive purchase option agreement to acquire the net assets of privately held saronix llc 
the purchase price is expected to be under million  much of which has been advanced to saronix in the form of convertible secured loans 

table of contents contractural obligations and commitments the following table depicts our contractual obligations as of june  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years thereafter operating leases total contractual cash obligation the company leases certain facilities under operating leases 
the company has no debt  no capital leases and no purchase obligations as of june  recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
pericom adopted sfas no 
for its fiscal year beginning july  on that date  we ceased amortizing goodwill with a net carrying value of  at june  and annual amortization of  that resulted from business combinations initiated prior to the adoption of sfas  business combinations 
we determined that no impairment of this goodwill existed in fiscal we will continue to evaluate such goodwill at least annually 
years ended june  in thousands  except per share amounts reported net income loss add goodwill amortization adjusted net income loss reported basic earnings loss per share add goodwill amortization per basic share adjusted basic earnings loss per share reported diluted earnings loss per share add goodwill amortization per diluted share adjusted diluted earnings loss per share in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
it superseded sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for the disposal of a segment of a business 
we adopted sfas no 
on july  the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 

table of contents in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statement no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas requires that any gains or losses on extinguishment of debt that were classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods that are not unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence be reclassified to other income expense  beginning in fiscal  with early adoption encouraged 
we adopted sfas no 
on july  the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue no 
sfas no 
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of our commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december   irrespective of a guarantor s year end 
the disclosure requirements of fin were effective for interim and annual periods ending after december   and are applicable to our product warranty liability and other guarantees 
we adopted the provisions of fin for guarantees issued or modified after december   and the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require prominent disclosure about the effects an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income in both annual and interim periods 
sfas is effective for annual periods ending after december  and interim periods beginning after december  we adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas effective march  and continue to account for stock based compensation under apb opinion and related interpretations 
the adoption of the disclosure requirements of sfas did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity vie  formerly referred to as special purpose entities 
fin applies to any business enterprise  both public and private  that has a controlling interest  contractual relationship or other business relationship with a vie 
fin provides guidance for determining when an entity the primary beneficiary should consolidate a vie that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
we have no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a vie  and therefore the adoption will not have an effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure at june   our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash equivalents  of million see note of notes to financial statements 
these securities are 
table of contents subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
for example  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year
