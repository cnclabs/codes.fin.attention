item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general petroquest is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition and operation of oil and gas properties onshore and offshore in the gulf coast region 
we have been active in this area since  which gives us extensive geophysical  technical and operational expertise in this area 
our business strategy is to increase production  cash flow and reserves through exploration  development and acquisition of properties located in the gulf coast region 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires recording the fair value of an asset retirement obligation associated with tangible long lived assets in the period incurred 
retirement obligations associated with long lived assets included within the scope of sfas are those for which there is a legal obligation to settle under existing or enacted law  statute  written or oral contract or by legal construction under the doctrine of promissory estoppel 
we will record the fair value of these obligations on january   and will record the related additional assets 
the estimated fair value of the obligations at january  is approximately  the net difference between our previously recorded abandonment liability and the amounts estimated under sfas  after taxes  is expected to total a gain of approximately  which will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on the reported results 
sfas no 
is effective for the year ended december  and for interim financial statements commencing in our adoption of this pronouncement did not have an impact on financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain related employee costs  incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing and oil and natural gas are capitalized 
acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase  lease or otherwise acquire property 
exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells  including those in progress and geological and geophysical service costs in exploration activities 
development costs include the costs of drilling development wells and costs of completions  platforms  facilities and pipelines 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
sales of oil and gas properties  whether or not being amortized currently  are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas 
the costs associated with unevaluated properties are not initially included in the amortization base and related to unevaluated leasehold acreage and delay rentals  seismic data and capitalized interest 
these costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we compute the provision for depletion of oil and gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
unevaluated costs and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated 
in addition to costs associated with evaluated properties  the amortization base includes estimated future development costs and dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values 
our depletion expense is affected by the estimates of future development costs  unevaluated costs and proved reserves  and changes in these estimates could have an impact on our future earnings 
we capitalize certain internal costs that are directly identified with the acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the capitalized internal costs include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other related expenses and do not include costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we also capitalize a portion of the interest costs incurred on our debt 
capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated property and our effective borrowing rate 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a and related deferred taxes  are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related income tax effects the full cost ceiling 
if capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  the excess is charged to write down of oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is probable that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil or gas prices decline  even for only a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
future abandonment costs future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
the accounting for future abandonment costs changed on january   with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
see new accounting standards in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this accounting standard 
reserve estimates our estimates of oil and gas reserves are  by necessity  projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of expected oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variance may be material 
derivative instruments the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
all of our commodity derivative instruments represent hedges of the price of future oil and gas production 
the changes in fair value of those derivative instruments that qualify for treatment due to being highly effective are recorded to other comprehensive income until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
estimating the fair values of hedging derivatives requires complex calculations incorporating estimates of future prices  discount rates and price movements 
instead  we choose to obtain the fair value of our commodity derivatives from the counter parties to those contracts 
since the counter parties are market makers  they are able to provide us with a literal market value  or what they would be willing to settle such contracts for as of the given date 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to our oil and gas operations for the years ended december   and year ended december  production oil bbls    gas mcf    total production mcfe    sales total oil sales    total gas sales    average sales prices oil per bbl gas per mcf per mcfe the above sales include income related to gas hedges of  and  and oil hedges of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we were not hedged during comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the results are attributable to the following components production oil production in increased over the year ended december  natural gas production in decreased over the year ended december  on a mcfe basis  total production for the year ended december  decreased over the same period in the decrease in total production volumes  as compared to  was due to the consistent decline of our gulf coast production partially offset by the drilling success during prices average oil prices per bbl during were as compared to for the same period in average gas prices per mcf were during as compared to for the same period in stated on a mcfe basis  unit prices received during were lower than the prices received during revenue oil and gas sales during decreased to  as compared to revenues of  the slight decrease in production volumes and reduced commodity prices resulted in the decrease in revenue 
expenses lease operating expenses for increased to  from  during on a mcfe basis  lease operating expenses increased from per mcfe in to in the increase during is primarily due to increased insurance costs and an increase in the repairs and maintenance at the ship shoal field 
general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to expenses of  during  net of amounts capitalized of  and  respectively 
the increases in general and administrative expenses are primarily due to an increase in staffing levels and rent expense related to the generation of prospects  exploration for oil and gas reserves and operation of properties 
we recognized  and  of non cash compensation expense during and  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for increased to  as compared to  in on a mcfe basis  which reflects the changes in production  the dd a rate for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe for the increase in as compared to is due primarily to costs in excess of previous estimates during the previous twelve months and unsuccessful exploration drilling results during interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated prospects  decreased  during as compared to the decrease is the result of an decrease in the average debt levels and interest rates during we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
income tax expense of  was recognized during as compared to  being recorded during the decrease is due to a decrease in operating profit during the current year 
we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the positive results are attributable to the following components production oil production in increased over the year ended december  natural gas production in increased over the year ended december  on a mcfe basis  production for the year ended december  increased over the same period in the increase in production volumes  as compared to  was due to our successful drilling program  which had a success rate completing of wells drilled in prices average oil prices per bbl during were as compared to for the same period in average gas prices per mcf were during as compared to for the same period in stated on a mcfe basis  unit prices received during were lower than the prices received during revenue oil and gas sales during increased to  as compared to revenues of  the significant growth in production volumes partially offset by reduced commodity prices resulted in significant increases in revenue 
expenses lease operating expenses for increased to  from  during the increase during is primarily due to the increase in production on a mcfe basis 
on a mcfe basis  lease operating expenses decreased from per mcfe in to in general and administrative expenses during totaled  as compared to expenses of  during  net of amounts capitalized of  and  respectively 
the increases in general and administrative expenses are primarily due to an increase in staffing levels related to the generation of prospects  exploration for oil and gas reserves and operation of properties 
additionally  we have recognized  of non cash compensation expense during as a result of extending the life of two directors options  we recognized  of non cash compensation expense during the fourth quarter 
we also recognized  of non cash compensation expense related to the amortization of unearned deferred compensation 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for increased to  as compared to  in the rise in dd a is primarily due to increased production from bringing new wells on line since the first quarter of on a mcfe basis  which reflects the changes in production  the dd a rate for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe for the increase in as compared to is due primarily to the significant capital and future development costs related to our offshore projects 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized on unevaluated prospects  increased  during as compared to the increase is the result of an increase in debt levels during resulting from property acquisitions and a higher capital budget  which has been partially funded by borrowings 
we capitalized  and  of interest during and  respectively 
income tax expense of  was recognized during as compared to an  benefit being recorded during the increase is the result of fully reversing the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset during we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our exploration and development activities to date principally through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings  private and public offerings of common stock and sales of properties 
source of capital operations net cash flow from operations during the year decreased from  in to  in this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the average realized commodity prices 
working capital before considering debt increased from million at december  to million at december  this was caused primarily by the reduction of payables from our fourth quarter common stock offering 
source of capital debt petroquest and our subsidiary petroquest energy  llc the borrower have a million revolving credit facility with a group of three banks which permits us to borrow amounts from time to time based on our available borrowing base as determined in the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by a mortgage on substantially all of the borrower s oil and gas properties  a pledge of the membership interest of the borrower and petroquest s corporate guarantee of the indebtedness of the borrower 
the borrowing base under this credit facility is based upon the valuation on march and september of the borrower s mortgaged properties  projected oil and gas prices  and any other factors deemed relevant by the lenders 
we or the lenders may also request additional borrowing base redeterminations 
on september   the borrowing base under the credit facility was adjusted to million and is subject to quarterly reductions of million commencing on january  outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility bear interest at either the prime rate plus per year whenever the borrowing base usage under the credit facility is greater than or equal to or the eurodollar rate plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on borrowing base usage 
the credit facility also allows us to use up to million of the borrowing base for letters of credit for fees of per annum 
at december   we had million of borrowings and a million letter of credit issued pursuant to the credit facility 
the credit facility contains covenants and restrictions common to borrowings of this type  including maintenance of certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all of our covenants at december  the credit facility matures on june  source of capital issuance of equity securities we have an effective universal shelf registration statement relating to the potential public offer and sale by petroquest of any combination of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  and warrants from time to time or when financing needs arise 
the registration statement does not provide assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 
during october and november  we completed the offering of  shares of our common stock 
the shares were sold to the public for per share 
after underwriting discounts  we realized proceeds of approximately million 
during february and march  we completed the offering of  shares of our common stock 
the shares were sold to the public for per share 
after underwriting discounts  we realized proceeds of approximately million 
source of capital sales of properties on march   we closed the sale of our interest in valentine field for million 
the transaction had an effective date of january  at december   our independent reservoir engineering firm attributed bcfe of proved reserves net to our interest in this field 
consistent with the full cost method of accounting  we did not recognize any gain or loss as a result of this sale 
the proceeds were treated as a reduction of the full cost pool 
use of capital exploration and development we have an exploration and development program budget for the year which will require significant capital 
our capital budget for direct capital for new projects in is approximately million 
our management believes the cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility  after the march and september regularly scheduled redeterminations  will be sufficient to fund planned exploration and development activities 
currently  the borrowing base is scheduled to be reduced to million as of december  management believes that the regularly scheduled redeterminations will generate an increased borrowing capacity above such amount at year end 
in the future  our exploration and development activities could require additional financings  which may include sales of additional equity or debt securities  additional bank borrowings  sales of properties  or joint venture arrangements with industry partners 
we cannot assure you that such additional financings will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we could be forced to delay or even abandon some of our exploration and development opportunities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company experiences market risks primarily in two areas interest rates and commodity prices 
the company believes that its business operations are not exposed to significant market risks relating to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company s revenues are derived from the sale of its crude oil and natural gas production 
based on projected annual sales volumes for  a decline in the estimated average prices the company receives for its crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate million impact on the company s revenues 
in a typical hedge transaction  the company will have the right to receive from the counterparts to the hedge  the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  the company is required to pay the counterparts this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
the company is required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price when the floating price exceeds the fixed price regardless of whether the company has sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require the company to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging will also prevent the company from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge 
as of december   the company had open fixed price swap contracts with third parties  whereby a fixed price has been established for a certain period 
these agreements in effect for are for oil volume of  barrels per day at a weighted average price of  and gas volume of  mmbtu per day at a weighted average price of 
at december   the company recognized a liability of  related to these derivative instruments  which have been designated as cash flow hedges 
we currently have two interest rate swaps covering million of our floating rate debt 
the swaps which expire in november and have fixed interest rates of and  respectively 
the swaps are stated at their fair value and are marked to market through other income in our income statement 
as of december   the fair value of the open interest rate swaps was a liability of  the company also evaluated the potential effect that reasonably possible near term changes may have on the company s credit facility 
debt outstanding under the facility is subject to a floating interest rate and represents of the company s total debt as of december  based upon an analysis utilizing the actual interest rate in effect and balances outstanding as of december  and assuming a increase in interest rates and no changes in the amount of debt outstanding  the potential effect on interest expense for is approximately
