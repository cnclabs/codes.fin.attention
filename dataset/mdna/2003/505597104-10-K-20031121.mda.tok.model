results of operations earnings laclede group s results are primarily impacted by the regulated activities of its largest subsidiary  laclede gas  missouri s largest natural gas distribution company 
utility earnings are generated by the sale of heating energy  which historically have been heavily influenced by the weather 
during fiscal  earnings from this segment suffered from a significant weather related reduction in natural gas sales  primarily as a result of a heating season that was the fifth warmest on record and warmer than normal 
in sharp contrast  natural gas sales returned to near normal levels for fiscal as the heating season was just colder than normal  but colder than fiscal the significantly warmer temperatures experienced in fiscal were warmer than in fiscal as part of the rate case settlement  the utility initiated  effective november   an innovative weather mitigation rate design that lessens the impact of weather volatility on laclede gas customers during cold winters and is expected to stabilize the utility s earnings for the future 
laclede group s net income applicable to common stock for fiscal was million  compared with million for fiscal  and million for fiscal laclede group s basic and diluted earnings per share were for the twelve months ended september  compared with per share for the same period last year 
the 
per share increase in earnings was primarily attributable to increased earnings reported by laclede gas 
in addition to the favorable effect of higher gas sales arising from the colder weather  earnings also improved due to the impacts of rate changes put into effect by laclede gas on december  and november   higher income from off system sales and capacity release  and benefits resulting from the utility s management of its annual gas supply costs 
these factors were partially offset by the effect of income recorded in fiscal produced by the utility s price stabilization program and higher costs of doing business 
the increased utility earnings  coupled with higher earnings reported by laclede group s non regulated gas marketing subsidiary  laclede energy resources  inc ler  were partially offset by decreased results this year by sm p utility resources  inc sm p  a non regulated subsidiary acquired january  sm p s results mainly reflect the full fiscal year effect of seasonal losses this year  right sizing costs related to the loss of revenue related to two customers discussed below  and additional start up costs related to sm p s expansion into new markets and the addition of new customers 
laclede group s basic earnings per share were for the twelve months ended september  compared with per share for the twelve month period ending september  the 
per share decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to reduced earnings reported by laclede gas 
the utility s earnings were adversely affected by lower gas sales arising from temperatures in its service area that were significantly warmer than the prior year  and  the missouri public service commission s decision not to extend the utility s gas supply incentive plan gsip beyond september  the gsip produced significant benefits for customers and shareholders during the preceding five years during which the program was in effect 
these factors were partially offset by the benefit of the general rate increase effective on december   nearly million of pre tax income from the utility s price stabilization program psp recorded in  and higher income from off system sales and capacity release revenues 
the psp is discussed further in the regulatory matters section below 
laclede group s consolidated earnings were positively impacted by income recorded by sm p since its acquisition on january   amounting to approximately million  or 
per share 
operating revenues regulated operating revenues for fiscal year increased million  or  above fiscal the increase in operating revenues was primarily comprised of higher natural gas sales levels resulting from colder weather and other variations amounting to million  higher pga rates that are passed on to utility customers subject to prudence review of million  increased off system and capacity release revenues of million  and the general rate increases amounting to million 
regulated operating revenues for fiscal year decreased million  or  below fiscal  reflecting both the return to a more traditional level of wholesale gas prices and a weather related reduction in natural gas sales 
the decrease in operating revenues was primarily comprised of lower wholesale natural gas costs of million and lower natural gas sales levels and other variations of million 
these factors were slightly offset by the benefit of the utility s general rate increase  implemented december   amounting to million  and higher off system sales  capacity release and incentive revenues of million 
laclede gas sold and transported billion therms in compared with billion and billion in and  respectively 
laclede group s non regulated services operating revenues for fiscal year increased million from those revenues for last fiscal year primarily attributable to the twelve month effect of revenues recorded this year by sm p acquired january   partially offset by the partial loss of revenue related to two customers 
non regulated services operating revenues increased million in fiscal year from fiscal year due to the increased revenues from the sm p acquisition during fiscal year non regulated gas marketing revenues increased million from those revenues for fiscal year primarily due to increased gas marketing sales by laclede energy resources  inc non regulated gas marketing revenues decreased in fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to decreased gas marketing sales by laclede energy resources  inc non regulated other operating revenues increased million in fiscal year from fiscal year  and decreased million in fiscal year from fiscal year these variations were primarily due to changes in sales levels recorded by laclede pipeline company 
operating expenses regulated operating expenses in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal natural and propane gas expense increased million primarily attributable to higher volumes purchased for sendout arising from the colder weather  higher rates charged by our suppliers  and higher off system gas expense 
other operation and maintenance expenses increased million  or  primarily due to increased pension expense  a higher provision for uncollectible accounts  increased group insurance charges  higher wage rates  and increased insurance premiums 
these factors were partially offset by reduced distribution charges 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million primarily due to the effect of negative amortization of a portion of the depreciation reserve effective july   as authorized by the mopsc see note related to utility plant  depreciation and amortization 
this effect was partially offset by increased depreciable property 
taxes  other than income  increased million  or  primarily due to higher gross receipts taxes  reflecting the increased revenues 
regulated operating expenses in fiscal decreased million  or  from fiscal natural and propane gas expense decreased million primarily due to decreased rates charged by suppliers and lower volumes purchased for sendout due to the warmer weather  partially offset by higher off system gas expense 
other operation and maintenance expenses increased million  or  primarily due to higher group insurance charges  higher wage rates  increased insurance premiums  lower net pension credits  and costs to remove retired utility plant 
these factors were partially offset by a lower provision for uncollectible accounts and reduced distribution and maintenance charges 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million primarily due to the effect of lower depreciation rates instituted december  and negative amortization of a portion of the depreciation reserve effective july   as authorized by the mopsc see note related to utility plant  depreciation and amortization 
these effects were partially offset by increased depreciable property 
taxes  other than income  decreased million  or  primarily due to lower gross receipts taxes  reflecting the decreased revenues 
laclede group s non regulated services operating expenses in fiscal year increased million due to the twelve month effect of operating expenses recorded this year by sm p compared with fiscal year  right sizing costs expensed this year related to the aforementioned customer loss  and additional start up costs related to adding customers in new markets 
non regulated services operating expenses increased million in fiscal year from fiscal year due to the acquisition of sm p during fiscal year non regulated gas marketing operating expenses increased million and other non regulated operating expenses increased million in fiscal year mainly due to higher expenses associated with increased sales levels 
non regulated gas marketing operating expenses decreased million and other non regulated operating expenses decreased million in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year primarily due to lower expenses associated with decreased sales levels 
interest charges interest expense increased million  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to the issuance of trust preferred securities in december  partially offset by lower interest on long term debt due to the may maturity of million of first mortgage bonds and reduced short term interest expense primarily due to lower rates 
interest expense decreased million  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to decreased short term interest expense reflecting lower rates and reduced average borrowings  partially offset by higher interest on long term debt resulting from the issuance of million of first mortgage bonds in june and interest charges related to the bank note used to finance the acquisition of sm p 
income taxes the variations in income taxes for all periods reported are primarily due to changes in pre tax income 
other matters in november  two customers notified sm p that  due to actions they have taken to address workforce management issues  they did not intend to continue to outsource certain functions  which include locating services provided by sm p  after february and march one of these customers notified sm p in january that it would continue to outsource a portion of its locating services provided by sm p beyond that timeframe 
revenue from these customers totaled approximately million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
in connection with the reduction in work from these customers  sm p made reductions in the required levels of personnel  facilities and equipment  for which the company recorded an after tax charge of approximately million  all of which was expensed during the quarter ended march  labor agreement on july   laclede gas and union representatives reached a new four year labor agreement replacing the prior agreement that was to expire july  the new contract extends through july  the settlement resulted in wage increases of in all four years  along with lump sum payment provisions and other benefit improvements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements allowances for doubtful accounts estimates of the collectibility of trade accounts receivable are based on historical trends  age of receivables  economic conditions  credit risk of specific customers  and other factors 
employee benefits and postretirement obligations pension and postretirement obligations are calculated by actuarial consultants that utilize several statistical factors and other assumptions related to future events  such as discount rates  returns on plan assets  compensation increases  and mortality rates 
the amount of expense recognized by the utility is dependent on the regulatory treatment provided for such costs 
certain liabilities related to group medical benefits and workers compensation claims  portions of which are self insured and or contain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit exposure  are established based on historical trends 
goodwill valuation in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances occur that may reduce the value of goodwill 
in performing impairment tests  valuation techniques require the use of estimates with regard to discounted future cash flows of operations  involving judgments based on a broad range of information and historical results 
if the test indicates impairment has occurred  goodwill would be reduced which would adversely impact earnings 
laclede gas accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement sets forth the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for those companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator 
the provisions of sfas no 
require  among other things  that financial statements of a regulated enterprise reflect the actions of regulators  where appropriate 
these actions may result in the recognition of revenues and expenses in time periods that are different than non regulated enterprises 
when this occurs  costs are deferred as assets in the balance sheet regulatory assets and recorded as expenses when those amounts are reflected in rates 
also  regulators can impose liabilities upon a regulated company for amounts previously collected from customers and for recovery of costs that are expected to be incurred in the future regulatory liabilities 
management believes that the current regulatory environment supports the continued use of sfas no 
and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory process 
we believe the following represent the more significant items recorded through the application of sfas no 
the utility s purchased gas adjustment pga clause allows laclede gas to flow through to customers  subject to prudence review  the cost of purchased gas supplies  including the costs  cost reductions and related carrying costs associated with the utility s use of natural gas financial instruments to hedge the purchase price of natural gas 
the difference between actual costs incurred and costs recovered through the application of the pga are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities that are recovered or refunded in a subsequent period 
the company records deferred tax liabilities and assets measured by enacted tax rates for the net tax effect of all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes  and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
changes in enacted tax rates  if any  and certain property basis differences will be reflected by entries to regulatory asset or liability accounts for regulated companies  and will be reflected as income or loss for non regulated companies 
also  pursuant to the direction of the mopsc  laclede gas provision for income tax expense for financial reporting purposes reflects an open ended method of tax depreciation 
this method is consistent with the regulatory treatment prescribed by the mopsc to depreciate the utility s assets 
for further discussion of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report on form k on page regulatory matters at the state level  there have been several important developments during the fiscal year affecting laclede gas  some of which are still pending 
laclede gas previously appealed the mopsc s decision in its rate case relative to the calculation of its depreciation rates 
the circuit court remanded the decision to the mopsc based on inadequate findings of fact 
the mopsc upheld its previous order and laclede gas appealed this second order to the circuit court 
in  the circuit court ruled that the mopsc s second order was lawful and reasonable  and laclede gas appealed the circuit court s decision to the missouri western district court of appeals 
on march  the court of appeals issued an opinion remanding the decision to the mopsc based on the mopsc s failure to support and explain its decision with adequate findings of fact 
in may  the court of appeals rejected the mopsc s request that the court reconsider its opinion or transfer this matter to the missouri supreme court 
on may   the staff of the commission filed a motion to investigate laclede gas company s alleged transfer of its gas supply function to laclede energy services  inc les  a subsidiary of laclede group  and such action s ramifications  including whether such alleged transfer required commission approval or was otherwise lawful 
on june  laclede gas responded  pointing out that it had not transferred its gas supply functions to les but had instead delegated five employees to les with responsibility for performing various gas supply administrative duties  many of which had been performed in prior years by an outside party 
laclede gas remained primarily responsible for the gas supply function 
laclede gas urged the commission to deny staff s motion on this and other grounds 
the commission concluded that a case should be established to investigate the issues raised by the staff 
the commission also ordered the staff to file a status report regarding progress of the investigation and laclede gas to file any responses to the staff s status report 
on march   laclede gas filed a motion with the commission indicating that les would be dissolved and that in light of such action the parties had agreed that the investigation could be terminated and the case closed 
on april   les ceased to exist as a corporation 
on april   the commission ordered that the investigation be dismissed and the case closed 
the dissolution of les had no material effect on the financial position and results of operations of laclede group 
on june   the staff of the mopsc filed its recommendation in a proceeding established to review laclede gas gas costs for fiscal in its recommendation  the staff proposed to disallow approximately million in pre tax gains achieved by laclede gas in its incentive based price stabilization program 
this program was discontinued at the end of the heating season 
laclede gas believes that staff s position lacks merit and has vigorously opposed the adjustment in proceedings before the mopsc  including a formal hearing that was held on this matter in february nevertheless  on april   the mopsc decided by a vote to disallow the million in pre tax gains achieved by laclede gas  and directed laclede gas to flow through such amount to its customers in its november pga filing 
on june   laclede gas appealed the mopsc s decision to the cole county circuit court 
on october   the circuit court issued an order staying the mopsc s decision requiring laclede to flow through the million to customers 
pursuant to the stay order  laclede will instead pay the million into the court s registry pending a final judicial determination of laclede s entitlement to such amounts 
on november   the circuit court of cole county  missouri  issued its order and judgment vacating and setting aside the commission s decision on the grounds that it was unlawful and not supported by competent and substantial evidence on the record 
the court s order and judgment becomes final days after the date it was issued  at which time it will be subject to appeal 
on july   laclede gas filed a proposed catch up keep up program with the mopsc that would permit the company to use a portion of the savings from its negotiated pipeline discounts to fund a low income energy assistance program 
pursuant to  and among revisions to the program filed by the utility on september   the amount of discount savings that could be used for this purpose would be limited to million per year 
in response to certain objections filed by the mopsc staff and missouri office of the public counsel  the commission suspended the tariffs implementing the program and scheduled a prehearing conference that occurred on october  formal hearings were held on december and  on january   the commission  by a to vote  issued an order rejecting the proposed plan 
on january   the utility filed a motion for reconsideration seeking to identify whether the commission would approve the program at a reduced funding level of million per year 
on february  the commission convened a hearing for oral argument 
on march  the commission denied the company s motion for reconsideration 
on october   the mopsc approved a settlement reached among the parties to the rate case  filed by laclede gas on january  the terms of the settlement included an annual rate increase of million effective on november   a moratorium on additional rate filings until march   and an innovative rate design that is expected to provide the utility with the ability to recover its distribution costs  which are essentially fixed  in a manner that is significantly less sensitive to weather 
the settlement also provided for  among other things  changes resulting in negative amortization of the depreciation reserve of million annually effective from july  until the utility s next rate case proceeding  minor changes in depreciation rates effective january   and changes in the regulatory treatment of pension costs primarily designed to stabilize such costs  effective beginning fiscal also approved was an incentive program beginning in fiscal under which the utility may achieve  under specific conditions  income related to management of its gas supply commodity costs 
previously deferred costs of 
million are being recovered and amortized on a straight line basis over a ten year period  without return on investment  effective with implementation of the new rates  in addition to certain amounts authorized previously 
on july   a bill was signed into missouri law that  among other things  allows gas utilities to adjust their rates twice a year to recover the depreciation  property taxes  and rate of return on facility related expenditures that are made to comply with state and federal safety requirements or to relocate facilities in connection with public improvement projects 
this bill was signed into law and became effective on august  the bill did not have any impact on laclede during fiscal year  and the utility is currently evaluating the impact it may have on future periods 
the utility anticipates that the bill will have a generally favorable impact on cash flows and earnings 
on october   the mopsc issued an order conditionally granting the utility s request for a three year extension  through october   of its authorization to issue securities pursuant to its universal shelf registration

the provisions of the statement provide for rate regulated entities that meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
 such as laclede gas  to recognize regulatory assets or liabilities for differences in the timing of recognition of the period costs associated with asset retirement obligations for financial reporting pursuant to this statement and rate making purposes 
the adoption of this statement on october  did not affect the financial position or results of operations of laclede group 
there are legal obligations related to final abandonment of the utility s gas distribution system

because of indeterminate settlement dates and cash flow estimates 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no

should be shown net in the income statement if the derivative instruments are purchased for trading purposes 
application of these consensuses did not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of laclede group 
inflation the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the historical costs of events and transactions  regardless of the purchasing power of the dollar at the time 
due to the capital intensive nature of the business of laclede gas  the most significant impact of inflation is on the depreciation of utility plant 
rate regulation  to which laclede gas is subject  allows recovery through its rates of only the historical cost of utility plant as depreciation 
while no plans exist to undertake replacements of plant in service other than normal replacements and those under existing replacement programs  laclede gas believes that any higher costs experienced upon replacement of existing facilities would be recovered through the normal regulatory process 
credit ratings as of september   credit ratings for outstanding securities for laclede group and laclede gas issues were as follows type of facility s p moody s fitch laclede group corporate rating a laclede gas first mortgage bonds a a a laclede gas commercial paper a p trust preferred securities a baa bbb on may   standard poor s s p downgraded the long term corporate credit rating for laclede group and laclede gas first mortgage bonds from a to a 
s p cited bondholder protection parameters that have eroded due to several successive warmer than normal winters and increasing debt leverage as reasons for the downgrade 
s p ratings outlook is currently stable 
the company s ratings remain investment grade  and the company believes that it will have adequate access to the markets to meet its capital requirements 
these ratings remain subject to review and change by the rating agencies 
liquidity and capital resources the company s short term borrowing requirements typically peak during colder months when laclede gas borrows money to cover the gap between when it purchases its natural gas and when its customers pay for that gas 
these short term cash requirements have traditionally been met through the sale of commercial paper supported by lines of credit with banks 
during the fiscal year heating season  laclede gas had lines of credit in place of up to million 
laclede gas sold commercial paper aggregating to a maximum of million at any one time during the fiscal year  but did not borrow from the banks under the aforementioned agreements 
at this writing  laclede gas has aggregate lines of credit totaling million  including a seasonal credit line of million expiring february  short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september  were million at a weighted average interest rate of 
based on short term borrowings at september   a change in interest rates of basis points would increase or decrease pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million on an annual basis 
most of laclede gas lines of credit include a covenant limiting total debt  including short term debt  to no more than of total capitalization 
on september   total debt was of total capitalization 
laclede gas has filed a shelf registration on form s of the million of securities originally registered under this s  million of debt securities remained registered and unissued as of september  the original mopsc authorization for issuing securities registered on this form s expired in september in response to an application filed by the utility  the mopsc has extended this authorization through october  the amount  timing and type of additional financing to be issued under this shelf registration will depend on cash requirements and market conditions 
on may   million of series first mortgage bonds matured and were funded with the sale of commercial paper 
at september   laclede gas had fixed rate long term debt totaling million 
while these long term debt issues are fixed rate  they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change 
however  increases or decreases in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if laclede gas were to reacquire any of these issues in the open market prior to maturity 
short term cash requirements outside of laclede gas have been met with internally generated funds 
however  laclede group has a million working capital line of credit obtained from us bank national association  expiring in june  with interest rates indexed to libor or prime  to meet short term liquidity needs of its subsidiaries 
in april  the ratings triggers in this line of credit were replaced by a covenant limiting the total debt of laclede gas company to no more than of the utility s total capitalization as noted above  this ratio stood at on september  this line has been used to provide a letter of credit of million on behalf of sm p 
the letter of credit has not been drawn  nor have there been other uses of this credit line to date 
it may  however  be used for seasonal funding needs of the various subsidiaries from time to time throughout the year 
on december   laclede capital trust i issued  trust preferred securities at a par value of each and a distribution rate of 
these securities mature december   but may be redeemed at laclede s option on or after december  the proceeds of this issuance were used to repay laclede group s short term loan of million from u 
s 
bank  which had funded the acquisition in january of sm p utility resources  inc  and for other general corporate purposes 
these trust preferred securities were issued under laclede group s shelf registration on form s  which became effective may   and allows for the issuance of equity securities  other than preferred stock  and debt securities 
of the million of securities originally registered under this s  million remain registered and unissued as of september  the amount  timing and type of additional financing to be issued under this shelf registration will depend on cash requirements and market conditions 
sm p has several operating leases  the aggregate annual cost of which is approximately million  consisting primarily of month operating leases  with renewal options  for vehicles used in its business 
upon acquisition of sm p  laclede group assumed parental guarantees of certain of those vehicle leases 
laclede group anticipates that the maximum guarantees related to existing leases will not exceed million 
laclede group had guarantees outstanding totaling million for performance and payment of certain wholesale gas supply purchases by laclede energy resources  inc ler its non regulated marketing affiliate  as of september  laclede group issued an additional million guarantee in november on behalf of ler 
utility construction expenditures were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal laclede gas expects fiscal utility construction expenditures to approximate million 
non regulated construction expenditures for fiscal were million compared with million in fiscal  and are estimated at approximately million in fiscal consolidated capitalization at september   excluding current obligations of long term debt  consisted of laclede group common stock equity  
laclede gas preferred stock  laclede capital trust i preferred securities and laclede gas long term debt 
the portion of preferred securities in the consolidated capital structure increased with the december  issuance of trust preferred securities by laclede capital trust i 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was for  for and for it is management s view that the company has adequate access to capital markets and will have sufficient capital resources  both internal and external  to meet anticipated capital requirements 
market risk laclede gas adopted a risk management policy that provides for the purchase of natural gas financial instruments with the goal of managing price risk associated with purchasing natural gas on behalf of its customers 
this policy prohibits speculation 
costs and cost reductions  including carrying costs  associated with the utility s use of natural gas financial instruments are allowed to be passed on to the utility s customers through the operation of its purchased gas adjustment clause  through which the mopsc allows the utility to recover gas supply costs 
accordingly  laclede gas does not expect any adverse earnings impact as a result of the use of these financial instruments
