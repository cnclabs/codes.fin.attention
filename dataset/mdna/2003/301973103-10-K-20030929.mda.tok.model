significant events on september   we entered into a definitive agreement with hopkins financial services for the sale and leaseback of our headquarters building and land in boise  idaho 
we closed the transaction on september  the sale price of the building and land was million 
we received approximately million in net cash proceeds after deducting fees related to the transaction and will entered into a year master lease for the building with annual lease payments equal to of the sale price 
we are also obligated to pay all expenses associated with the building during our lease  including the costs of property taxes  insurance  operating expenses and repairs 
we have a year option to repurchase the building at a price of million 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  the sale and leaseback will be recorded as a financing transaction and will be reflected as long term debt on our balance sheet for our quarter ending september  on september   we entered into a definitive agreement with brighton investments  llc for the sale of approximately acres of excess land adjacent to our headquarters building in boise  idaho 
upon closing  we expect to receive approximately million in net cash proceeds after deducting fees related to the transaction 
we expect to report a gain of approximately million on the sale 
we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of fiscal subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
on august   steven simpson  our former president and chief executive officer  resigned from the company 
in addition  we expect to complete a workforce reduction of approximately employees in the first quarter of fiscal as a result  we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal  consisting primarily of severance costs related to the resignation and workforce reduction 
the restructuring charge reflects approximately  in non cash compensation resulting from accelerated vesting of employee stock options 
of the remaining   is expected to be paid prior to the end of september and  including  of severance payable to mr 
simpson  will be paid over the next months 
the company expects an operating expense decrease of approximately  per quarter as a result of the restructuring that will be completed in the first quarter of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted a formal plan to exit our infrared hardware business as a result of an expected decline in sales of these products and our desire to increase our focus on our core software businesses 
throughout the year we continued to see revenue from this business as customers placed final orders 
as of june   the business had been successfully wound down 
we have stopped accepting new orders and we are shipping final orders 
overview we classify our product offerings into one operating segment  our mobile information management segment  which consists of products and services that extend enterprise applications to mobile and wireless environments 
the products in our mobile information management segment include data synchronization and management software  wireless connectivity products and client server database management systems with remote access capabilities 
until april  we also marketed and sold enterprise internet appliances 
we sell our mobile information management products primarily to enterprises  original equipment manufacturers  application developers and resellers both directly and through our e commerce storefronts on the internet 
we derive revenue from o software license fees and royalties  o support and maintenance fees  and o professional services  including non recurring development fees that we generate when we adapt products to customers specifications and consulting services 
our future results of operations will be highly dependent upon the success of our software products and services  specifically our mobile groupware solutions  our mobile solutions platforms and tools  our mobile business solutions  and our wireless connectivity software 
we expect the license fees and royalties generated by these products to continue to constitute a significant majority of our revenue 
we derive a significant amount of our revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states  principally from our international sales subsidiaries  overseas original equipment manufacturers and from a limited number of international distributors 
based on the region in which the customer resides  net revenue from continuing operations may be analyzed as follows for the years ended june net revenue percentages by region domestic international europe asia other regions total international net revenue from continuing operations the percentage of revenue from europe as compared to other international revenue increased in fiscal from fiscal as a result of an increase in royalties from a european oem customer and an increase in revenues caused by the decrease in the strength of the us dollar as compared to the euro and british pound sterling  which resulted in sales by our european subsidiaries being greater in us dollars than they would have been had the exchange rate remained constant in fiscal the increase in domestic revenue as a percentage of our total revenue from fiscal to is primarily due to a decrease in sales of our internet products in europe and a decrease in sales of our xtnd access hardware products to oem customers located in asia 
we also saw an increase in domestic sales of our advantage database server products in fiscal in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total advantage database server revenue 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenue in the foreseeable future and will comprise between and of our net revenue throughout fiscal revenue generated from sales to original equipment manufacturers and to companies that license our software to include in their own software offering has fluctuated in the past 
we expect it will also fluctuate in future quarters  because demand in these markets is difficult to predict  as it is dependent upon the timing of customer projects and the effectiveness of their marketing efforts 
we sell our products directly to end user customers and also market and sell many of our products through multiple indirect channels  primarily distributors and resellers 
no customers accounted for greater than of revenue from continuing operations in fiscal  or critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a material impact on our net revenue  operating income and net income loss  as well as on the value of certain assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
the policies described below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain our significant accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements are highlighted below 
revenue recognition to recognize software revenue we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  and generally recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable  based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after the shorter of our normal payment terms or days  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due and payable 
if we had assessed the fixed or determinable criterion differently  the timing and amount of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
at the time of the transaction we also assess whether or not collection is reasonably assured based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer recognition of the fee as revenue  and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
if we assessed collectibility differently  the timing and amount of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for instance  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method 
this means that we defer revenue from the total fees associated with the arrangement equivalent to the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the elements of the arrangement that have not yet been delivered 
the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of an undelivered element is generally established by using historical evidence specific to extended systems 
for example  the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance and support is based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon the renewal rates quoted in the contracts  and the fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales by us of these services to other customers 
if we allocated the respective fair values of the elements differently  the timing of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
for certain of our products  we do not sell maintenance separately but do provide minimal support and bug fixes and  from time to time  minor enhancements to ensure that the products comply with their warranty provisions 
accordingly  we allow for warranty costs at the time the product revenue is recognized 
when we license our software to original equipment manufacturers or to companies that include our software in their software offering  royalty revenue is generally recognized when customers report to us the sale of software to their end user customer 
in cases where the arrangement with our customer provides for a prepaid nonrefundable royalty  we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exits  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue for support and maintenance services ratably over the contract term  which is usually months  and we generally recognize revenue from training services as these services are performed 
for professional services that involve significant implementation  customization  or modification of our software that is essential to the functionality of the software  we generally recognize both the service and related software license revenue over the period of the engagement  using the percentage of completion method 
in cases where our professional services involve customizations for which the amount of customization effort cannot be reasonably estimated  where significant uncertainty about the project completion exists  or where an arrangement provides for customer acceptance  we defer the contract revenue under the completed contract method of accounting until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved or the contract is complete 
if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates of the total amount of work we expect to be required to complete an engagement  the timing of our revenue recognition from period to period  as well as the related margins  might differ materially from that previously reported 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  fixed assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a market capitalization approach when the information is readily available 
when the information is not readily available  we use a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model to measure any impairment 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates our measurement of any impairment may have differed materially from that reported 
income taxes on a quarterly basis we evaluate our deferred tax asset balance for realizability 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
as of june   we had recorded a valuation allowance against percent of our net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
this valuation allowance was recorded based on our estimates of future us and foreign jurisdiction taxable income and our judgments regarding the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount or timing of the valuation allowance recorded may have differed materially from that reported 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to reduce the valuation allowance  potentially resulting in an income tax benefit in the period of reduction  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
where specific collection issues are identified  we record a specific allowance based on the amount that we believe will not be collected 
for accounts where specific collection issues are not identified  we record a reserve based on the age of the receivable and historical collection patterns 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the timing and amount of our reserve may have differed materially from that reported 
results of continuing operations the following section sets forth our results of continuing operations for the fiscal years ended june    and net revenue fiscal year ended june  change change revenue license fees and royalties    services    hardware and other  total net revenue    license fees and royalties 
license and royalty revenue consists of fees for licenses of our software products 
the growth in revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase of in license and royalty revenue from our mobile groupware  mobile solutions platforms and tools and mobile business solutions products 
license fees and royalties net revenue was also positively impacted by the decrease in the strength of the us dollar relative to the euro and the british pound sterling  which resulted in sales by our european subsidiaries being greater in us dollars than they would have been had the exchange rate remained constant in included in this increase was an increase of  due to adding the onebridge presentation server and mobile business solutions products to our product mix with the acquisition of viafone 
we also saw a increase in sales of advantage software licenses 
the decrease in license fees and royalties in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in license fees and royalties from our wireless connectivity software products due to the timing of original equipment manufacturer s development 
this decrease was partially offset by a increase in revenue from our mobile groupware solutions products products caused by an increase in licenses sold 
we expect revenue from license fees and royalties to increase in fiscal this increase is expected to come primarily from increased licensing of our onebridge products  including our groupware  mobile solutions platform and mobile business solutions products 
services 
services revenue consists primarily of support and maintenance contracts sold to our customers and fees for professional services 
our professional services typically consist of standard product installations  training  significant customization of our software products and non recurring engineering nre 
the primary driver of the increase in service revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal was the increase in professional services we saw as a result of adding a dedicated professional services group to our solutions kit in the first quarter of fiscal in connection with the viafone acquisition 
the majority of our professional services for fiscal related to implementations of our mobile solutions platforms and tools and mobile business solutions products 
our service revenue increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to an increase in support and maintenance revenue generated from contracts on new licenses sold and contract renewals 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from non recurring engineering and other consulting projects  which fluctuates as a result of the timing of customer projects 
we expect service revenue to increase in fiscal although we expect an overall increase in the amount of billable hours of our professional services group  service revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the amount of revenue we may be required to defer under our revenue recognition policy and the timing of services engagements 
hardware and other 
hardware and other revenue consists primarily of sales of our enterprise internet products which we stopped marketing in april the increase in revenue in fiscal from fiscal was related to an increase in units sold 
the significant decrease in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in unit sales of our enterprise internet hardware products after april we expect hardware and other revenue to remain relatively flat and insignificant in amount in fiscal cost of revenue fiscal year ended june  gross gross gross margin margin margin license fees and royalties    services    hardware and other  license fees and royalties 
the cost of license and royalty revenue consists primarily of amortization of purchased technology and royalties for the use of third party software 
the cost of license fees and royalties decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in operations related facilities and overhead costs  including reductions in headcount resulting from our restructurings 
in fiscal  the cost of license and royalty revenue decreased compared to fiscal  primarily attributable to a decrease in operations related costs related to headcount reductions and other cost reductions resulting from the sale of our print server business 
we expect the cost of license fees and royalties to increase in fiscal as a result of an expected increase in revenue from license fees and royalties 
an expected reduction in operations costs and in amortization expense of purchased technology  resulting from a portion of our purchased technology becoming fully amortized in the first quarter of fiscal  is expected to be offset by an increase in royalty costs as a result of an expected increase in revenue 
gross margin on license fees and royalties revenue increased in fiscal and in fiscal as a result of the cost reductions described above 
we expect gross margin on license fees and royalties to be in a range of to percent in fiscal services 
the cost of services consists primarily of compensation and benefits for our professional services and post sales support personnel 
the cost of services increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the addition of a dedicated professional services organization in the first quarter of fiscal in conjunction with our acquisition of viafone 
the cost of services decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs associated with post sales effort in our internet and advantage products and a decrease in professional services costs related to our xtndconnect products 
gross margin on services revenue decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decline is primarily the result of a higher mix of professional services revenue in fiscal  which typically generates lower margins than support and maintenance revenue 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the reduction in cost of services described above 
we expect the cost of services to increase in fiscal as a result of an expected increase in professional services revenue 
we expect gross margin on services to be in the range of to percent 
this range is driven by the mix between professional services and support and maintenance revenue and the utilization rate of our professional services personnel 
given the high level of fixed costs associated with the professional services group  our inability to generate sufficient services revenue to absorb these fixed costs could lead to lower or negative gross margins 
hardware and other 
the cost of hardware and other revenue consists primarily of out sourced manufacturing and in house labor costs associated with the manufacturing of our mobile information management hardware products 
the increase in gross margin from hardware and other revenue from fiscal to was primarily the result of a significant decrease in unit sales of mobile information management hardware products  including xtndaccess irda printer adapters and our enterprise internet appliance products 
the negative cost of hardware and other revenue in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the inventory accrual for internet appliance products at our german subsidiary 
we expect the cost of hardware and other revenue to be insignificant in fiscal research and development expenses fiscal year ended june  change change research and development    as a of net revenue research and development expenses generally consist of salaries and other personnel costs of our research and development teams  consulting costs and facility expenses 
the decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal and fiscal as compared to the prior years was primarily the result of a reduction in personnel costs and consulting costs subsequent to our restructurings 
we were able to reduce research and development costs in fiscal and fiscal as a result of completing the fundamental development work for our onebridge mobile groupware platform formerly xtndconnect server upon which our current data synchronization and management product offerings are built 
at june  we had full time equivalent research and development personnel  a decrease from the full time equivalent personnel at the same time last year and at june  in connection with our acquisition of viafone in august  we incurred an in process research and development charge of  in fiscal in fiscal  we expect our research and development costs to decrease as compared to fiscal as a result of a reduction in personnel costs subsequent to our restructurings 
marketing and sales expenses fiscal year ended june  change change marketing and sales    as a of net revenue marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and other personnel costs of our sales  marketing  and pre sales support staff  and promotional expenses 
the increase in marketing and sales expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of approximately million  offset in part by a decrease in promotional expenses of approximately  the decrease in marketing and sales expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in personnel costs subsequent to our restructurings in fiscal and and a reduction in promotional expenses of approximately million 
at june   we had full time equivalent marketing  sales  and support personnel and contractors  as compared to full time equivalent personnel and contractors at the same time last year and at june  we expect marketing and sales expenses to increase in fiscal as a result of an expected increase in revenue  although we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of net revenue 
we expect that the increase in marketing and sales expenses in fiscal will be primarily attributable to increased sales compensation 
general and administrative expenses fiscal year ended june  change change general and administrative    as a of net revenue general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and other personnel costs for our finance  management information systems  human resources and other administrative groups  as well as professional fees and directors and officers insurance costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in legal fees of approximately million related to our patent litigation with pumatech  offset in part by a decrease of approximately  in personnel costs resulting from our restructurings in prior quarters and a decrease in bad debt expense of approximately  the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to million of expenses incurred in fiscal associated with our terminated merger with palm  inc  a decrease of approximately  in bad debt expense and a decrease in personnel costs subsequent to our restructuring completed in fiscal these decreases were offset in part by an increase in legal fees in fiscal of approximately  related primarily to our patent litigation with pumatech 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal as a result of an expected increase in legal fees associated with the pumatech litigation as we approach our april trial date and an expected increase in directors and officers insurance 
we also expect to report increased non cash compensation expense as a result of a change in the compensation plan for our independent board of directors 
at june   we had full time equivalent employees in administration  as compared to full time equivalent personnel at the same time last year and at june  no general and administrative personnel were added with our acquisition of viafone 
amortization of goodwill as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  we did not record amortization of goodwill for fiscal year amortization of goodwill was  for fiscal and fiscal and was reflected in our statement of operations as an operating expense 
we report amortization of non goodwill intangibles  primarily consisting of purchased technology  as a component of cost of license fees and royalty revenue 
amortization of non goodwill intangibles was  for fiscal and  for each of the fiscal years and the net increase in fiscal compared to and results from the addition of non goodwill intangibles in connection with our acquisition of viafone 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
 which resulted in  of intangible assets  comprised of assembled workforce intangibles  being reclassified as goodwill in the first quarter of fiscal we expect a decrease in amortization of non goodwill intangibles in fiscal as a result of a portion of our purchased technology becoming fully amortized in the first quarter in fiscal restructuring charge we recorded  in workforce reduction costs during fiscal  consisting primarily of severance  benefits  and other costs related to the termination of employees in research and development  marketing and sales  manufacturing  and administration  of which were located in the united states  in canada and in europe 
as of june  we had paid  of these charges 
the remaining balance of  will be paid in the first two quarters of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal we also assumed a restructuring liability in connection with our acquisition of viafone 
prior to our acquisition of the company  viafone had implemented a restructuring program that resulted in charges for workforce reduction costs  costs related to closing its office in france and excess facilities costs related to lease commitments for space no longer used in brisbane  california 
at the time we completed the viafone acquisition  there were  of future lease commitments that had been accrued but not yet paid   of workforce reduction liabilities and  of liabilities relating to the closure of viafone s french office 
as of june  the workforce reduction liabilities and liabilities related to closing viafone s french office had been paid in full  and the balance of future lease commitments assumed was  we expect to pay  in each of the next three quarters and  in the final quarter of fiscal for these lease commitments 
a summary of the restructuring costs is outlined as follows workforce reduction facilities and costs other costs total restructuring charges incurred in fiscal   cash payments balance at june    restructuring charges incurred in fiscal cash payments   balance at june  restructuring charges incurred in fiscal restructuring accrual assumed with viafone acquisition   adjustment to the accrual assumed with viafone acquisition cash payments  balance at june  in the first quarter of fiscal we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately million  consisting primarily of severance costs 
this charge is primarily related to severance charges resulting from the august resignation of steven simpson  the company s former president and chief executive officer  in addition to a workforce reduction to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal the restructuring charge reflects approximately  in non cash compensation resulting from accelerated vesting of employee stock options 
of the remaining   is expected to be paid prior to the end of september and  including  of severance payable to mr 
simpson  will be paid over the next months 
the company expects an operating expense decrease of approximately  per quarter as a result of the restructuring that will be completed in the first quarter of fiscal other expense income fiscal year ended june  change change foreign currency exchange gain loss interest income other net expense income other expense and income consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to the mark to market of intercompany amounts owed to us by our international subsidiaries and interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances 
we recognized a foreign currency exchange gain in fiscal as a result of a decrease in the strength of the us dollar in the fourth quarter at a time when we were not entering into foreign currency forward contracts 
in fiscal  we recognized an exchange loss as a result of our intercompany balance forecasts differing from projections in a period of currency volatility 
for additional information on our foreign currency exposure see item a of this form k 
interest income declined in fiscal and due to a decline in the amount of cash invested and declines in short term interest rates during fiscal and we are not using foreign currency forward contracts to manage fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies on transactions with our foreign subsidiaries for the first quarter of fiscal as a result  we expect to report a foreign exchange loss in a range of  to  in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the us dollar strengthening significantly relative to the euro  british pound sterling and canadian dollar in the first quarter 
the amount of any foreign currency exchange gain or loss for the remaining quarters of fiscal will depend upon currency volatility  the amount of our intercompany balances and whether we decide to enter into foreign currency forward contracts in future quarters 
we expect interest income to increase in fiscal as a result of an expected increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from the sale and leaseback of our building in boise  idaho  the expected sale of excess land and cash we expect to generate from our operations in fiscal interest expense interest expense consists primarily of warrant expense amortization related to entering into our line of credit agreement with silicon valley bank in january and interest paid on the silicon valley bank term debt that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of viafone in august interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily as a result of interest expense related to our assumption of million of term debt in connection with the viafone acquisition and as a result of fiscal including a full year of warrant amortization 
we had no interest expense or debt in fiscal we expect interest expense to increase by approximately  in fiscal as a result of entering into the sale and leaseback agreement for our building  which will be accounted for as a financing transaction 
income tax provision benefit fiscal year ended june  change change income tax provision benefit   as a of income loss before taxes the income tax benefit decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of recording an income tax benefit of approximately million in the third quarter of fiscal for the refund we received as a result of the temporary increase in the net operating loss carryback period created by the job creation and worker assistance act of the change in the income tax provision or benefit in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of recording income tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal to set up a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets and recognizing the million income tax benefit in fiscal we expect to record an income tax provision of approximately  in fiscal related to payments of foreign taxes 
we expect that any provisions we would otherwise record will be offset by our deferred tax assets 
business combinations in august  we completed our acquisition of viafone 
for information on this acquisition and the acquisition of appreach completed in february  see note business combinations in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this report 
results of discontinued operations in each of our fiscal years ended   and  we exited a historical business which no longer fit into the company s strategy for becoming the global leader in providing mobile solutions for the enterprise 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted a formal plan to exit our infrared hardware business as a result of an expected decline in sales of these products and our desire to increase our focus on our core software businesses 
throughout the year we continued to see revenue from this business as customers placed final orders 
as of june   the business has been successfully wound down 
we have stopped accepting new orders and we are shipping final orders 
on june   we completed the sale of extended systems singapore pte ltd  our wholly owned singapore subsidiary  to brookhaven asia ltd  a holding company co owned by the existing management team of extended systems singapore pte ltd 
the purchase price for all the outstanding shares of the company was  we originally acquired extended systems singapore ltd  formerly parallax research ltd  in november the singapore operation was instrumental in driving our infrared hardware business  and in managing our relationships with third party contract manufacturers in asia 
as we have continued to focus our efforts on our mobile and wireless enterprise software solutions  revenue from our hardware products has been a declining percentage of our net revenue 
as a result  the singapore entity was no longer strategic to our business 
on may   we sold our printing solutions segment  which included our network print server and non network printer sharing products to troy group  inc for million in cash  net of expenses 
we sold our printing solutions segment to troy because the segment was not consistent with our core business strategy  which focuses on mobile information management solutions 
as a result of the reclassification of our infrared hardware business  our singapore subsidiary  and our printing solutions segment as discontinued operations  results for these operations are reported  net of tax  under income from discontinued operations on our statements of operations 
fiscal year ended june  change change net revenue    income from discontinued operations  net of tax  gain loss on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax our revenue from discontinued operations for fiscal consisted primarily of revenue from our discontinued infrared hardware business 
although our infrared hardware business was discontinued in the first quarter of fiscal  we continued to see revenue throughout the year as customers continued to place last time orders 
the decrease in net revenue from discontinued operations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of there being no revenue from our former singapore subsidiary and no material revenue from our discontinued printing solutions segment in fiscal the decrease in net revenue from discontinued operations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of there being no material revenue from our discontinued printing solutions segment in fiscal and a significant decrease in revenue in our singapore subsidiary from fiscal to fiscal income from discontinued operations was higher in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in net income from our infrared hardware operations in fiscal  which was a result of minimizing expenses related to these operations  and because in fiscal the singapore business generated a net loss 
income from our discontinued operations decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of there being no material revenue from our discontinued printing solutions segment in fiscal and as a result of the decrease in income generated by our singapore subsidiary due to decreased sales to hewlett packard 
we do not expect income from discontinued operations to be significant in fiscal liquidity  capital resources and financial condition net cash used by operating activities fiscal year ended june  net cash used by operating activities    net cash used by operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of our net loss and the result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  adjusted for such non cash items as depreciation and amortization 
these cash uses were partially offset by acquired in process research and development 
net cash used by operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of our net loss and the result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  adjusted for such non cash items as depreciation and amortization 
these cash uses were partially offset by a decrease in receivables and inventories  and an increase in deferred revenue 
net cash used by operating activities in fiscal was primarily a result of our net loss  adjusted for such items as the change in deferred taxes and our depreciation and amortization  provision for bad debts and provision for write down of inventory 
this cash use was partially offset by a decrease in receivables  an increase in payables and a decrease in inventory 
accounts receivable  net of allowance  were million and million at june  and  respectively 
the increase in accounts receivable from fiscal to fiscal is due primarily to an increase in total net revenue  but is offset partially by a decrease in dsos days sales outstanding 
we expect that our accounts receivable will increase in fiscal as a result of an expected increase in net revenues 
accounts receivable may also increase in the future if net revenue from international customers becomes a higher percentage of our net revenue 
generally  these customers have longer payment cycles 
net cash provided by investing activities fiscal year ended june  net cash provided by investing activities   net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of completing the acquisition of viafone 
as part of our continued effort to control cash and expenses  we did not make a significant investment in property and equipment in fiscal net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of proceeds from the sale of our singapore subsidiary net of cash sold with the entity 
these proceeds were partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of  as part of our effort to control cash and expenses  we did not make a significant investment in property and equipment in fiscal net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of proceeds from the sale of our discontinued operations  which consisted of our printing solutions segment  and proceeds from the sale of our facility in bozeman  montana 
these proceeds were offset  in part  by purchases of property and equipment of  we plan to incur aggregate capital expenditures of approximately  during fiscal  primarily for tenant improvements  software  system improvements  and personal computers 
net cash provided by used by financing activities fiscal year ended june  net cash provided by used by financing activities  net cash used by financing in fiscal was primarily the result of payments on term debt assumed as part of our acquisition of viafone of  partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans of  in fiscal and fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans of  and  respectively 
on january   we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank  under which we can currently access up to million of financing in the form of a demand line of credit  subject to current accounts receivable balances 
the line of credit is collateralized by certain of our assets 
interest on any borrowings will be paid at prime plus one percent but not less than 
the line of credit agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and expires on january  we are in compliance with all covenants 
there are no outstanding draws on this facility 
upon completion of our acquisition of viafone on august   we assumed million of term debt with silicon valley bank 
we have restructured that debt into a term loan due in equal monthly installments bearing interest at 
the term loan is collateralized by certain of our assets  requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and is scheduled to be paid in full by march on september   we closed the sale and leaseback of our headquarters building and approximately eight acres of land and received approximately million in net cash proceeds after deducting transaction costs 
as part of the agreement  we entered into a year master lease for the building with annual payments equal to approximately  in fiscal  we will make payments of approximately 
on september   we entered into a definitive agreement with brighton investments  llc for the sale of approximately acres of excess land adjacent to our headquarters building in boise  idaho 
upon closing  we expect to receive approximately million in net cash proceeds after deducting fees related to the transaction 
we expect to report a gain of approximately million on the sale 
we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of fiscal subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
we believe that our existing working capital  the funds from the sale and leaseback of our boise headquarters building  the expected funds from the sale of our excess land  our borrowing capacity and the funds we expect to generate from our operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
we cannot be certain  however  that our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will be accurate 
if our operating results were to fail to meet our expectations or if pumatech litigation fees  accounts receivable  or other assets were to require a greater use of cash than is currently anticipated  we could be required to seek additional sources of liquidity 
in addition  if the pumatech litigation were to have an unfavorable result for us  we could be required to pay damages or royalties  or to discontinue sales of certain products  any of which could result in a greater use of cash than is currently anticipated 
this could also require us to seek additional sources of liquidity 
these sources of liquidity could include raising funds through public or private debt financing  borrowing against our line of credit or offering additional equity securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  substantial dilution to our stockholders could result 
in the event additional funds are required  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
we intend to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions of  or strategic investments in  companies with complementary products  technologies or distribution networks in order to broaden our mobile information management product offerings 
we currently have no commitments or agreements regarding any material transaction of this kind  however  we may acquire businesses  products or technologies in the future 
as a result  we may require additional financing in the future and  if we were required to obtain additional financing in the future  sources of capital may not be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
effects of foreign currency exchange rates we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from international sales  principally through our international subsidiaries and through a limited number of independent distributors and overseas original equipment manufacturers 
sales made by our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in each country s respective currency 
fluctuations in exchange rates could cause our results to fluctuate when we translate revenue and expenses denominated in other currencies into us dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates also may make our products more expensive to original equipment manufacturers and independent distributors who purchase our products in us dollars 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  typically against the canadian dollar  euro and british pound sterling  to manage fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  these fluctuations are generally offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying asset or liability being managed  resulting in minimal net exposure for us 
these forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and  as such  the contracts are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
we report a net currency gain or loss based on changes in the fair value of forward contracts combined with changes in fair value of the underlying asset or liability being managed 
the success of these currency activities depends upon estimation of intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
when determining whether to enter into foreign currency forward contracts  we also consider the impact that the settlement of such forward contracts may have on our cash position 
to eliminate a potential cash settlement of a forward position we may  from time to time  decide not to use foreign currency forward contracts to manage fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries 
in a period where we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts  we could experience significant non cash currency gains or losses if the value of the us dollar strengthens or weakens significantly in relation to the value of the foreign currencies 
we had no forward contracts in place as of june  as of june   we had forward contracts with a nominal value of million in place against the euro and british pound sterling  which matured within days 
we recognized a net currency exchange gain of  for the fiscal year ended june  and net currency exchange losses of  and  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we believe we have no investment in or contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity  and therefore  the adoption of this interpretation did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is generally effective for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in certain contracts  entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity and requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities or assets in certain circumstances in statements of financial position 
sfas also requires disclosures about alternative ways of settling the instruments and the capital structure of entities all of whose shares are mandatorily redeemable 
sfas is generally effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock we have a recent history of losses and may continue to generate losses in fiscal since the third quarter of our fiscal  we have devoted significant financial resources to the research and development of  and marketing and sales for  our mobile information management software products and  as a result  we have generated operating losses 
we intend to continue to devote significant financial resources to product development  to marketing and sales  and to the defense of pumatech s claims against us 
our ability to reach break even from operations and our ability to reach profitability and positive cash flow from operations in subsequent periods  will depend on a number of factors  including o our ability to generate sufficient revenue and control expenses  o buying patterns of our enterprise  application developer and original equipment manufacturer customers  o changes in customer demand for our products  o the timing of customer orders  which can be influenced by fiscal year end buying patterns  seasonal trends or general economic conditions  o announcements or introductions of new products or services by our competitors  o the outcome of our litigation with pumatech  inc and the impact of any litigation on our financial and management resources  o delays in our development and introduction of new products and services  o changes in our pricing policies as a result of increased competition  o the mix of distribution channels through which we sell our products  o the market acceptance of our new and enhanced products and the products of our customers that are application developers and original equipment manufacturers  o the market adoption rate of bluetooth or other technologies on which a number of our products are based  o the emergence of new technologies or industry standards  o normal seasonality that we typically experience in the first quarter of our fiscal year  and o a shift in the mix of professional services and licensing revenue  which may result in fluctuations in our gross margin 
our business relies on enterprises implementing mobile applications and devices and may be harmed by declines in information technology spending 
the market for our products depends on economic conditions affecting the broader economic climate and spending on information technology  including mobile applications and devices 
downturns in the overall economy may cause enterprises to delay implementation of mobile device and application rollouts  reduce their overall information technology budgets or reduce or cancel orders for our products 
our original equipment manufacturer customers may also limit development of new products that incorporate our products or reduce their level of purchases of our products in the face of slower information technology spending by their customers 
the general weakening of the global economy and weakening of business conditions  particularly in the information technology  telecommunications  financial services and manufacturing industry sectors  have resulted in potential customers experiencing declines in their revenue and operations 
in this environment  customers may experience financial difficulty or cease operations 
while we believe we have adequately factored these conditions into our current revenue forecasts  if these conditions worsen or continue longer than expected  demand for our products may be reduced as a result of enterprises reducing information technology spending on our products and original equipment manufacturers reducing their use of our products in their own products 
as a result  our revenue may fail to grow or could decline  which would harm our operating results 
if the current economic slowdown persists or worsens  we also may be forced to reduce our operating expenses  which could result in additional charges incurred in connection with restructuring or other cost cutting measures we may implement 
for example  in both the first and third quarters of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  we announced restructuring plans to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies and  as a result  incurred restructuring costs  primarily for severance payments to terminated employees 
our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly and fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future 
our revenue and operating results will vary from quarter to quarter for many reasons beyond our control  including those described in this section 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the price of our stock may fall 
in addition  quarter to quarter variations in our revenue and operating results could create uncertainty about the direction or progress of our business  which could result in a decline in the price of our stock 
we forecast many of our operating expenses based on forecasted revenue  which is difficult to predict 
if we fail to accurately predict revenue in a particular period  we may be unable to adjust our expenditures in that period and our operating results would be harmed 
our quarterly revenue and operating results currently depend in large part on the volume and timing of orders received within the quarter and on the number of software seats licensed  which are difficult to forecast 
significant portions of our expenses are related to personnel and  therefore  are fixed in advance  based in large part on our forecast of future revenue 
if revenue is below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust personnel and other expenditures to compensate for the shortfall 
our business may be harmed if pumatech prevails in the patent litigation with us and they are awarded significant damages or become entitled to significant royalties  or if we are required to cease selling any of our current products or we if are required to incur additional development costs 
on april   pumatech  inc filed a patent infringement action against us in the us district court in northern california 
an amended complaint was filed on may  the action alleges that our xtndconnect server and desktop synchronization products infringe on seven of pumatech s synchronization related patents  that our alleged use of the trademark satellite forms constitutes trademark infringement  and that other alleged actions constitute unfair competition and interference with contract 
the action seeks an injunction against further sales of our server and desktop synchronization products and use of the allegedly infringing trademark  as well as unspecified damages and attorneys fees 
on june   we filed an answer and counterclaim in response to pumatech s complaint in which we deny pumatech s charges  raise a number of affirmative defenses and request a declaration from the court that pumatech synchronization software patents are invalid and not infringed by our products 
on december   pumatech filed a second amended complaint  which adds allegations that unspecified synchronization products infringe an eighth pumatech patent 
on december   we filed an amended answer and counterclaim in which we deny all of pumatech s charges  including this additional charge  and amend our defenses and counterclaims to include this additional patent 
on august  the honorable 
judge d 
lowell jensen  united states district judge  issued his claims construction ruling on the interpretation  definition  and scope of the claims in the suit 
we believe that the court s ruling has significantly narrowed claims in five of the pumatech patents 
the court also ruled that it could not correct an error that appears in all asserted claims of pumatech s patent 
this error must be corrected in reissue proceedings in the patent office 
until the patent office issues corrected claims  no synchronization software can infringe the patent  and it is unlikely that such a correction would have any retroactive effect 
as a result  if any of our products are ultimately held to be infringing this patent  it is unlikely that pumatech would be entitled to damages for any period prior to the reissue date 
we have petitioned the us patent office for reexamination of three of the pumatech patents 
the patent office has issued an office action for each of the three patents rejecting all pumatech patent claims over the prior art for two of the patents and rejecting all claims on which we requested reexamination for the other patent 
as a result of the reexamination process  we expect the patents to be significantly narrowed or rejected by the patent office in their entirety 
if the patents are amended and reissued  and we are ultimately held to be infringing one of the reissued patents  it is unlikely that pumatech would be entitled to damages for any period preceding the reissue date 
discovery and other pretrial proceedings are on going  trial is currently scheduled for april we believe that we have numerous meritorious defenses to pumatech s claims and we intend to continue to defend the suit vigorously 
however  litigation is inherently uncertain  and we may not prevail in our defenses or counterclaims 
if pumatech prevails in one or more of its claims  we could be required to pay substantial damages for past sales of infringing products  to cease selling specific of our server or desktop synchronization products that are held to infringe a pumatech patent  to pay royalties on the sales of specific products that are held to infringe a pumatech patent  or some combination of these results 
we may also incur significant development costs to redesign certain of our products to ensure that they are non infringing 
any of such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position 
in addition  litigation is frequently expensive and time consuming  and management may be required to spend significant time in the defense of the suit  such costs and the diversion of management time could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and the range of loss that could occur upon resolution of this matter is not estimable 
we cannot estimate the costs of any potential settlement 
were an unfavorable outcome to occur  the impact could be material to our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the success of our business may depend on us identifying and securing additional sources of financing  which sources may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms 
we believe that our existing working capital  the funds from the sale and leaseback of our boise building  the expected funds from the sale of our excess land  our borrowing capacity and the funds we expect to generate from our operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
we cannot be certain  however  that our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will be accurate 
if our operating results were to fail to meet our expectations or if pumatech litigation fees  accounts receivable  or other assets were to require a greater use of cash than is currently anticipated  we could be required to seek additional sources of liquidity 
in addition  if the pumatech litigation were to have an unfavorable result for us  we could be required to pay damages or royalties  or to discontinue sales  of certain products  any of which could result in a greater use of cash than is currently anticipated 
this could also require us to seek additional sources of liquidity 
these sources of liquidity could include raising funds through public or private debt financing  borrowing against our line of credit or offering additional equity securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  substantial dilution to our stockholders could result 
in the event additional funds are required  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
if the markets for our products do not continue to grow or do not grow at expected rates  demand for our products would be reduced and our business would be harmed 
the success of our products currently will rely to a large degree on the increased use by individuals and enterprises of mobile devices  including personal digital assistants  cell phones  pagers and laptop and handheld computers  and on increased use of technologies such as syncml and bluetooth 
even if markets for our products grow  our products may not be successful 
enterprises and original equipment manufacturers may not develop sufficient confidence in mobile devices to deploy our products to a significant degree 
any inability to continue to penetrate the existing markets for mobile data management and wireless connectivity product solutions  the failure of current markets to grow  new markets to develop or these markets to be receptive to our products and technologies on which our products are based  could harm our business 
the emergence of these markets will be affected by a number of factors beyond our control 
we depend on a number of key business relationships and if we fail to maintain these relationships  or are unable to develop new relationships  our business would suffer 
an important element of our strategy is the development of key business relationships with other companies that are involved in product development  joint marketing and the development of mobile communication protocols 
if we fail to maintain our current relationships or are unable to develop new relationships  our business would suffer 
some of these relationships impose substantial product support obligations on us  which may not be offset by significant revenue 
the benefits to us may not outweigh or justify our obligations in these relationships 
also  in order to meet our current or future obligations to original equipment manufacturers  we may be required to allocate additional internal resources to original equipment manufacturers product development projects  which may delay the completion dates of our other current product development projects 
our existing key business relationships do not  and any future key business relationships may not  provide us any exclusive rights 
many of the companies with which we have established and intend to establish key business relationships have multiple strategic relationships  and these companies may not regard their relationships with us as significant 
in most of these relationships  either party may terminate the relationship with little notice 
in addition  these companies may attempt to develop or acquire products that compete with our products 
they may do so on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors 
further  our existing business relationships may interfere with our ability to enter into other business relationships 
our investment in goodwill and intangibles resulting from our acquisitions could become impaired 
as of june   the amount of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles recorded on our books  net of accumulated amortization  was million 
we ceased amortizing goodwill upon our adoption of sfas no 
as of the beginning of fiscal  and we expect to amortize million of net identifiable intangibles in fiscal years through however  to the extent that our goodwill or other identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired because circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable  all or a portion of these assets may be subject to write off in the quarter of impairment 
such impairment and any resulting write off could have a negative impact on our results of operations in the period goodwill or other identifiable intangibles are written off 
markets for our products are becoming increasingly competitive  which could result in lower prices for our products or a loss of market share 
we may not compete successfully against current or future competitors  some of whom have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  more employees and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  public relations and distribution resources 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced margins  loss of market share and a change in our business and marketing strategies  any of which could harm our business 
the competitive environment may require us to make changes in our products  pricing  licensing  services or marketing to maintain and extend the market acceptance of our products 
price concessions or the emergence of other pricing or distribution strategies by our competitors or us may diminish our revenue 
we compete with o mobile data management companies  including aether systems  ibm  ianywhere a division of sybase  infowave  jp mobile  microsoft  pumatech  rim and synchrologic  o application mobilization companies  including everypath  ianywhere  microsoft  and oracle  o mobile enterprise solutions companies  including aether systems  dexterra  and telispark  o client server database providers  including interbase  microsoft  oracle and pervasive software  o mobile connectivity companies  including ivt corporation  open interface and widcomm  and o internal research and development departments of original equipment manufacturers  many of whom are our current customers 
as the markets for mobile information management products grow  we expect competition from existing competitors to intensify  and we expect new competitors  including original equipment manufacturers to which we sell our products  to introduce products that compete with ours 
additionally  if existing or new competitors were to merge or form strategic alliances  our market share may be reduced or pressure may be put on us to reduce prices resulting in reduced revenue and margins 
we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by o rapidly changing technologies  o evolving industry standards  o frequent new product introductions  and o short product life cycles 
any delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  the inability of our products to achieve market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could harm our business 
the product development process involves a number of risks 
development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires us to manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns 
if specific industry wide standards and protocols upon which our products are or will be based  do not achieve widespread acceptance  our business would be harmed 
we have designed a number of our current and upcoming products to conform to industry standards and protocols  such as o bluetooth  a short range radio communication protocol  o syncml  a data synchronization protocol  and o irda  a wireless communication protocol created by the infrared data association 
if these standards and protocols do not achieve acceptance  our business would be harmed 
even if accepted  these industry wide specifications may not be widely adopted  or competing specifications may emerge 
in addition  technologies based on these standards and specifications may not be adopted as the standard or preferred technologies for wireless connectivity  thereby discouraging manufacturers of personal computers and mobile devices from bundling or integrating these technologies in their products 
if our customers do not adopt wireless technologies  demand for our products would be reduced and our business would be harmed 
our products support the exchange of data with mobile devices via wired and wireless connections 
our future growth will depend  in part  on the adoption of wireless solutions by our customers 
the adoption of wireless solutions is dependent upon the development of generation or rd generation g or g networks that are intended to support more complex applications and to provide end users with a more satisfying user experience than today s networks 
if communication service providers delay their deployment of g or g networks or fail to roll such networks out successfully  our customers may not adopt wireless technologies  there could be less demand for our products and services and our business could be harmed 
in addition  if communication service providers fail to continue to make investments in their networks or invest at a slower pace in the future  there may be less demand for our products and services and our business could suffer 
we may not be able to adequately protect our patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights from competitors  and we may be required to use a significant amount of our resources to defend ourselves from infringement claims made by others 
our patents  trademarks or copyrights may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  and the rights granted under these patents  trademarks and copyrights might not provide us with any competitive advantage  which could harm our business 
any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the scope of the claims we are seeking  if at all 
in addition  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around our patents 
further  effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some countries outside of the united states 
companies in the software industry frequently resort to litigation over intellectual property rights 
if a court finds that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of any third party  we could be subject to liabilities  which could harm our business 
as a result  we might be required to seek licenses from other companies or to refrain from using  manufacturing or selling specific products or using specific processes 
holders of patents and other intellectual property rights may not offer licenses to use their patents or other intellectual property rights on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all could harm our business 
in order to protect our proprietary rights  we may decide to sue third parties 
any litigation  whether brought by or against us  could cause us to incur significant expenses and could divert a large amount of management time and effort 
a claim by us against a third party could  in turn  cause a counterclaim by the third party against us  which could impair our intellectual property rights and harm our business 
our business may be harmed due to risks associated with international sales and operations  which represent a substantial portion of our revenue 
in fiscal  based on the region where the customer resides  of our revenue was generated from international sales 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
international sales are subject to a number of risks  including o changes in government regulations  o export license requirements  o tariffs  taxes and trade barriers  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country and lead to a reduction in sales in that country  longer collection and payment cycles than those in the united states  o difficulty in staffing and managing international operations  and o political and economic instability  including the threat or occurrence of military and terrorist actions and enhanced national security measures 
our business may be harmed if our professional services organization does not generate an acceptable profit level 
our professional services business is subject to a variety of risks including o we may be unable to accurately predict staffing requirements and therefore the expense of fulfilling our service contracts may be greater than we anticipate  and o we may have an inappropriate level of resources dedicated to the professional services business in relation to the number of projects we are able to sell  resulting in a low utilization rate of resources 
if we are unable to operate the professional services organization effectively  the profitability of this business could decline  or even result in a loss  which could harm our business 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could cause our operating results to fluctuate 
the transactions made through our subsidiaries in canada  france  germany  italy  the netherlands and the united kingdom are primarily denominated in local currencies 
accordingly  these international operations expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations  which in turn could cause our operating results to fluctuate when we translate revenue and expenses denominated in other currencies into us dollars 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  typically against the canadian dollar  euro  and british pound sterling  to manage currency fluctuations on payments and receipts of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries 
the success of these currency activities depends upon estimation of intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
when determining whether to enter into foreign currency forward contracts  we also consider the impact that the settlement of such forward contracts may have on our cash position 
to eliminate a potential cash settlement of a forward position we may  from time to time  decide not to use foreign currency forward contracts to manage fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries 
in a period where we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts  we could experience significant non cash currency gains or losses if the value of the us dollar strengthens or weakens significantly in relation to the value of the foreign currencies 
for example  we recognized a foreign currency exchange gain in fiscal as a result of the dollar weakening in the fourth quarter at a time when we were not entering into foreign currency forward contracts  and we expect to report a foreign exchange loss in a range of  to  in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the us dollar strengthening significantly relative to the euro  british pound sterling and canadian dollar in the first two months of the quarter 
if we account for employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans using the fair value method  it could significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share 
there has been ongoing public debate whether employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans shares should be treated as a compensation expense and  if so  how to properly value such charges 
if we elected or were required to record an expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method  we could have significant accounting charges 
for example  in fiscal year  had we accounted for stock based compensation plans using the fair value method prescribed in fasb statement no 
as amended by statement  our net loss would have been increased by approximately million 
although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense using the fair value method in connection with option grants that have an exercise price at or above fair market value at the grant date and for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan  it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all stock based compensation as an expense using the fair value method 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed presentation of accounting for stock based compensation plans 
if we are required to treat all stock based compensation as an expense  we may change both our cash and stock based compensation practices 
we depend on non exclusive licenses for some of the technology we use with our products 
we license technology on a non exclusive basis from several companies for use with our products and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
for example  we license encryption technology that we include in our onebridge mobile groupware formerly xtndconnect server products 
our inability to continue to license this technology  or to license other technology necessary for use with our products  could result in the loss of  or delays in the inclusion of  important features of our products or result in substantial increases in royalty payments that we would have to pay pursuant to alternative third party licenses  any of which could harm our business 
in addition  the effective implementation of our products depends upon the successful operation of licensed software in conjunction with our products 
any undetected errors in products resulting from this licensed software may prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products  delay new product introductions and injure our reputation 
the complex computer software products that we produce may contain defects for which we may be liable 
the complex software products we offer may contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
these errors could result in dissatisfied customers  product liability claims and the loss of or delay in market acceptance of new or enhanced products  any of which could harm our business 
testing of our products is particularly challenging because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments in which our customers may deploy our products 
for example  our mobile information management products are used in a wide variety of telecommunications environments 
changes in technology standards or an increase in the number of telecommunications technologies used in the marketplace may create compatibility issues with our products and our customers environments 
accordingly  despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors could be found after commencement of commercial shipment 
a successful product liability claim brought against us could result in our payment of significant legal fees and damages  which would harm our business 
our stock price may be volatile and could drop significantly  resulting in the partial or total loss of a stockholder s investment 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may cause a stockholder s investment to decrease in value 
the following factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock o announcements of acquisitions by us or our competitors  o changes in our management team  o our ability to obtain financing when needed  o quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  o sales of significant numbers of shares within a short period of time  o the outcome of our litigation with pumatech  o announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  o general conditions in the computer and mobile device industry  o general economic conditions and their impact on corporate information technology spending  o price and trading volume volatility in the public stock markets in general  o announcements and updates of our business outlook  and o changes in security analysts earnings estimates or recommendations regarding our competitors  our customers or us 
if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  our business will suffer 
growth in our business may place a significant strain on our administrative  operational and financial resources and increase demands on our systems and controls  which could harm our business 
growth may also result in an increase in the scope of responsibility for management personnel 
we anticipate that our growth and expansion will require that we recruit  hire  train and retain new engineering  executive  sales and marketing  and administrative personnel 
difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel could require us to incur significant costs to recruit personnel or could limit our ability to grow 
in addition  in order to manage our growth successfully  we will need to continue to expand and improve our operational  management and financial systems and controls 
the failure to do so could harm our business 
the loss of key personnel  or our inability to attract and retain additional personnel  may harm our business 
our future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced  highly qualified management  technical  research and development  and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the computer software industry is intense  and there is a risk that we will have difficulty recruiting and retaining key employees 
in addition  new employees generally require substantial training  which may require substantial resources and management attention 
if we lose the services of one or more key employees  or if one or more of them decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  our business could be harmed 
searching for replacements for our key employees could divert management s time and result in increased operating expenses that may not be offset by either improved productivity or higher prices 
over the past two years  a number of our senior management employees have left extended systems  including most recently  steven simpson  our former president and chief executive officer  and we cannot assure you that there will not be additional departures 
any changes in management can be disruptive to our operations 
uncertainty created by turnover of key employees could result in reduced confidence in our financial performance  which could cause fluctuations in our stock price 
some anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan  as well as provisions of delaware law  could impair a takeover attempt 
we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
these include provisions o dividing our board of directors into three classes  each serving a staggered three year term  o authorizing blank check preferred stock  which could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to its common stock  o dividend and other rights superior to its common stock  o limiting the liability of  and providing indemnification to  directors and officers  o requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors  o specifying that stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of shareowners 
these provisions  alone or together  could deter or delay hostile takeovers  proxy contests and changes in control or management of extended systems 
as a delaware corporation  we also are subject to provisions of delaware law  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock 
in june  pursuant to a preferred stock rights agreement between extended systems and equiserve trust company  na  our board of directors issued certain preferred share purchase rights 
the rights were not intended to prevent a takeover of extended systems 
however  the rights may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of extended systems deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempted to acquire extended systems on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors  except pursuant to an offer conditioned upon redemption of the rights 
any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 
we intend to pursue additional acquisitions  and any acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate with our business  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or adversely affect our operating results 
as part of our strategy  we intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of companies that either complement or expand our existing business 
if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions  our business would be harmed 
we may not be able to properly evaluate the technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction  including accounting charges and transaction expenses 
acquisitions involve a number of risks and difficulties  including o the integration of acquired technologies with our existing products and technologies  o diversion of management s attention and other resources to the assimilation of the operations and employees of the acquired companies  o availability of equity or debt financing on terms favorable to us and our stockholders  o integration of management information systems  employees  research and development  and marketing  sales and support operations  o expansion into new markets and business areas  o potential adverse short term effects on our operating results  and o retention of customers and employees post acquisition 
in addition  if we conduct acquisitions using debt or equity securities  our existing stockholders investments may be diluted  which could affect the market price of our stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our liquid investments are at fixed interest rates and  therefore  the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
all of our liquid investments mature within days or less of june   therefore  we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of liquid investments is minimal 
sales made by our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the foreign country s currency 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the united states dollar and other currencies could materially harm our business 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  typically against the canadian dollar  euro  and british pound sterling  to manage fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries  thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
we report a net currency gain or loss based on changes in the fair value of forward contracts combined with changes in fair value of the underlying asset or liability being managed 
the success of these currency activities depends upon estimation of intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
when determining whether to enter into foreign currency forward contracts  we also consider the impact that the settlement of such forward contracts may have on our cash position 
to eliminate a potential cash settlement of a forward position we may  from time to time  decide not to use foreign currency forward contracts to manage fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies on transactions with our international subsidiaries 
in a period where we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts  we could experience significant non cash currency gains or losses if the value of the us dollar strengthens or weakens significantly in relation to the value of the foreign currencies 
we had no forward contracts in place as of june  as of june   we had forward contracts with a nominal value of million in place against the euro and british pound sterling  which matured within days 
we recognized a net currency exchange gain of  for the fiscal year ended june  and net currency exchange losses of  and  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively
