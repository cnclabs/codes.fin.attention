critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements in the preparation of financial statements and in the determination of company operating performance  the company utilizes certain significant accounting polices and these accounting policies are discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
also discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements are several new accounting pronouncements issued in and the impact of the new pronouncements is discussed below and in the consolidated financial statements 
as the company is in the business of developing  owning and managing apartment communities  its critical accounting policies relate to cost capitalization  asset impairment evaluation and the asset classification and accounting for real estate assets held for sale 
the company capitalizes those expenditures relating to acquiring new assets  developing new apartment communities and enhancing of the value of existing assets and that substantially extend the life of existing assets 
all other expenditures necessary to maintain a community in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 
additionally  for new development communities  carpet  vinyl and blind replacements are expensed as incurred during the first five years which corresponds to their estimated depreciable lives 
thereafter  these replacements are capitalized 
further  the company expenses as incurred all interior and exterior painting of communities 
for communities under development  the company capitalizes interest  real estate taxes  and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to apartment communities under development and construction 
interest is capitalized to projects under development based upon the weighted average cumulative project costs for each period multiplied by the company s weighted average borrowing costs  expressed as a percentage 
weighted average borrowing costs include the costs of the company s fixed rate secured and unsecured borrowings and the variable rate unsecured borrowings under its line of credit facilities 
the weighted average borrowing costs  expressed as a percentage  for the years ended december    and were  and  respectively 
the weighted average borrowing costs used by the company for interest capitalization generally increases as the company s variable rate unsecured debt decreases and decreases as the company s variable rate unsecured debt increases 
the internal personnel and associated costs are capitalized to the projects under development based upon the effort identifiable with such projects 
should the company reduce its development activities below a range of million to million annually  the company would need to either reduce its internal personnel and associated costs related to development and construction activities or reflect such costs as current period expenses 
the company treats each unit in an apartment community separately for cost accumulation  capitalization and expense recognition purposes 
prior to the commencement of leasing activities  interest and other construction costs are capitalized and reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress 
the company ceases the capitalization of such costs as the residential units in a community become substantially complete and available for occupancy 
this results in a proration of these costs between amounts that are capitalized and expensed as the residential units in a development community become available for occupancy 
in addition  prior to the completion of units  the company expenses as incurred substantially all operating expenses including pre opening marketing as well as property management and leasing personnel expenses of such communities

table of contents the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets using the methodology prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors considered by management in evaluating impairment of its existing real estate assets held for investment include significant declines in property operating profits  recurring property operating losses and other significant adverse changes in general market conditions that are considered permanent in nature 
if any real estate asset held for investment is considered impaired  a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
the company periodically classifies real estate assets as held for sale 
an asset is classified as held for sale after the approval of the company s internal investment committee and after an actual program to sell the asset has commenced 
upon the classification of a real estate asset as held for sale  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to the lower of its net book value or its fair value  less costs to sell the asset 
subsequent to the classification of assets as held for sale  no further depreciation expense is recorded 
real estate assets held for sale are stated separately on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
effective january  through the implementation of sfas no 
 the operating results of real estate assets held for sale and sold are reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying statements of operations 
the income from discontinued operations includes the revenues and expenses including depreciation and allocated interest expense  associated with the assets 
interest expense is allocated to assets held for sale based on actual interest costs for assets with secured mortgage debt 
interest expense is allocated to unencumbered assets based on the ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt multiplied by the weighted average interest rate on the company s unsecured debt for the period and further multiplied by the average book value of the assets sold 
this classification of operating results as discontinued operations applies retroactively for all periods presented for assets designated as held for sale in additionally  gains and losses on assets designated as held for sale in are classified as part of discontinued operations 
in years prior to  real estate assets held for sale were stated separately on the consolidated balance sheet in a manner consistent with approach discussed above 
however  the operating results and gains or losses on the sale of such assets were included in continuing operations 
as a result of this presentation  income from continuing operations and gains on property sales are not comparable between years 
in and  the financial accounting standards board issued several new accounting pronouncements and the pronouncements with a potential impact on the company are discussed in the following paragraphs 
sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections was issued in may sfas no

under sfas no 
 gains and losses from early debt retirements will only be treated as extraordinary items if they meet the criteria for extraordinary items under apb no 
since the definition of an extraordinary item is more restrictive under apb no 
 sfas no 
will generally cause the company to treat gains or losses from early debt retirements as part of income before extraordinary items 
this part of sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  and requires the reclassification of prior period extraordinary items not meeting the apb no 
criteria 
the company expects to implement this requirement of sfas no 
on january  upon implementation  the company will reclassify  net of minority interest  in and  net of minority interest  in from extraordinary items to expenses used in the determination of income from continuing operations 
the company believes this change is not significant to the company s results of operations or its financial position 
the remaining provisions of sfas no 
are generally not applicable to the company

includes the nature  purpose  size and activities of all variable interest entities where it is reasonably possible that such entities will be required to be consolidated by the company and the company s maximum exposure to loss from these entities 
the company currently does not have any interests in variable interest entities and believes that fin no 
will not have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial position 
results of operations the following discussion of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of operations  the accompanying selected financial data and the community operations segment performance information included below 
the company s revenues and earnings are generated primarily from the operation of its apartment communities 
for purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance  the company categorizes its operating communities based on the period each community reaches stabilized occupancy 
a community is generally considered by the company to have achieved stabilized occupancy on the earlier to occur of attainment of physical occupancy on the first day of any month or one year after completion of construction 
at december   the company s portfolio of apartment communities consisted of the following communities that were completed and stabilized for all of the current and prior year  five communities that achieved full stabilization during  and communities and additions to existing communities currently in the development or lease up stage 
sold communities include communities sold in  and that were not reflected in discontinued operations under sfas no 
see above 
the company has adopted an accounting policy related to communities in the lease up stage whereby substantially all operating expenses including pre opening marketing and management and leasing personnel expenses are expensed as incurred 
during the lease up phase  the sum of interest expense on completed units and other operating expenses including pre opening marketing and management and leasing personnel expenses will initially exceed rental revenues  resulting in a lease up deficit  which continues until such time as rental revenues exceed such expenses 
lease up deficits for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively

other revenue excludes interest income and third party services revenues included in total revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
other expenses includes certain indirect central office operating expenses related to management  grounds maintenance  and costs associated with commercial properties and furnished apartment rentals 
in addition to those expenses which relate to property operations  the company incurs recurring and non recurring expenditures relating to acquiring and developing new assets  materially enhancing the value of an existing asset  or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset  all of which are capitalized 
recurring capital expenditures are those that are generally expected to be incurred on an annual basis 
non recurring capital expenditures are those that generally occur less frequently than on an annual basis 
the operating partnership reported net income available to common unitholders of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and the company reported net income available to common shareholders of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in company operating performance in compared to reflects a decrease in fully stabilized community operating performance see discussion below  reduced earnings resulting from the company s asset sale and capital reinvestment program  increased depreciation and interest expense relating to new communities completed in and and increased general and administrative expenses 
the weaker operating performance in was somewhat offset by increased gains on asset sales between years and by the negative impact of severance and impairment charges in the impact of these items is discussed below

table of contents rental and other revenue decreased  or from to primarily due to the  or decline in revenues from fully stabilized communities discussed further below 
the rental and other revenue increases from the company s newly stabilized and lease up properties of  were offset by the revenue reduction of  from assets sold between years see discussion under discontinued operations comparisons of the impact of assets sold between and prior years is not comparable due to the implementation of sfas no 

property operating and maintenance expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased  or primarily due to increased central office management expenses as well as increased costs associated with a higher volume of corporate apartment rentals 
as discussed above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company exited the third party property management and landscape service business in the fourth quarter of through the sale of the businesses to their respective management teams 
these sales allowed the company to simplify its operations through a reduced work force from approximately  employees prior to the sale to approximately  employees as of december  and focus on its core business of owning  developing and managing multifamily real estate assets 
the net gain on property sales included in continuing operations of  for resulted from the sale of six communities containing  units  one commercial property and five land parcels 
the net gain on property sales included in continuing operations of  for resulted from the sale of two communities containing units and one commercial property 
this gain excluded losses of  related to these assets that were written down to their estimated fair value at december  these assets were all classified as assets held for sale at december  the net gain on property sales of   net of minority interest included in discontinued operations in  under sfas no

depreciation expense increased  or from to primarily due to increased depreciation on newly stabilized and lease up properties  partially offset by the cessation of depreciation on properties sold and currently held for sale 
interest expense increased  or from to primarily due to a  reduction in capitalized interest to development properties between years as the company s development pipeline transitioned to operating properties 
exclusive of the reduction in capitalized interest  the decrease in interest expense was a result of lower interest costs on the company s variable rate borrowings in general and administrative expenses increased  or  from to primarily due to reduced capitalization of certain costs associated with the company s development and construction efforts resulting from the reduced volume of development and construction activity between periods 
other expenses of in relates to the write down of a technology investment to its estimated fair value 
equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate entities increased from in to  in these losses reflect the company s share of earnings and losses from four single community limited liability companies see note to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents stabilized communities the company defines fully stabilized communities as those which have reached stabilization prior to the beginning of the previous year 
for the to comparison  fully stabilized communities are defined as those communities which reach stabilization prior to january  this portfolio consisted of communities with  units  including communities with  units located in atlanta  georgia  communities with  units located in dallas  texas  three communities with  units located in tampa  florida and seven communities with  units located in other markets 
the operating performance of these communities is summarized as follows year ended december  change rental and other revenue property operating and maintenance expense exclusive of depreciation and amortization revenue in excess of specified expense average economic occupancy average monthly rental rate per apartment unit apartment units in service communities which reached stabilization prior to january  in addition to those expenses which relate to property operations  the company incurs recurring and non recurring expenditures relating to acquiring new assets  materially enhancing the value of an existing asset  or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset  all of which are capitalized 
for the years ended december  and  recurring and non recurring expenditures were  and  or and on a per unit basis  respectively 
average economic occupancy is defined as gross potential rent less vacancy losses  model expenses and bad debt divided by gross potential rent for the period  expressed as a percentage 
the calculation of average economic occupancy does not include a deduction for concessions and employee discounts 
average economic occupancy  taking account of these amounts would have been and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
concessions were  and  and employee discounts were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
average monthly rental rate is defined as the average of the gross actual rental rates for leased units and the average of the anticipated rental rates for unoccupied units divided by total units 
rental and other revenue decreased  or from to this decrease resulted from a decline in the average economic occupancy of the portfolio from in to in and a decline in the average monthly rental rate per apartment unit 
the decline in average rental rate resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately  between years 
the aggregate decline in revenues related to vacancy loss  up front concessions and other property fees totaling approximately   and  respectively 
these declines in reflect the affect of the national recession on the company s primary markets coupled with a continuing supply of new apartment units 
this was especially true for the company s largest market  atlanta  georgia  which experienced job losses in and as many major employers downsized their workforce in response to slow economic activity 
property operating and maintenance expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization were essentially flat between years 
increased insurance expenses of  or were largely offset by decreased personnel expenses of or  decreased property tax expenses of or and decreased repairs and maintenance expenses of or 
insurance costs increased primarily due to the volatility in insurance markets caused by  among other things  increased terrorism risks 
property and liability coverage were both significantly higher for the renewal period 
personnel costs decreased due to both staff reductions and tighter control of wage levels between years 
property tax expenses decreased due to approximately of tax reductions for property taxes received and recognized in and a focused effort to control property taxes resulting in effectively no increase between years 
repairs and maintenance expenses decreased due to reduced grounds and overall expenses resulting from intensive cost control efforts in for  management expects modest declines in rental and other revenues driven primarily by declining rental rates 
similar to results  management intends to continue its cost control efforts with an expectation of only modest increases in operating expenses in primarily due to projected increases in property taxes and insurance expenses offset by reductions in personnel and maintenance expenses 
in light of an expectation of decreased revenues and slightly increased expenses in  stabilized community revenues in excess of specified expenses could decline when compared to post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp

the company uses funds from operations as a management tool to measure the operating performance of its communities 
inflation substantially all of the leases at the communities allow  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder  and thus may enable the company to seek increases in rents 
the substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less and the remaining leases are for up to two years 
at the expiration of a lease term  the company s lease agreements generally provide that the term will be extended unless either the company or the lessee gives at least sixty days written notice of termination 
in addition  the company s policy generally permits the earlier termination of a lease by a lessee upon thirty days written notice to the company and the payment of an amount equal to two month s rent as compensation for early termination 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effect of inflation
