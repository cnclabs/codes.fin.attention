item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a premier global management consulting firm 
we help leading organizations worldwide leverage technology to develop and implement growth strategies  improve operations  and capitalize on technology 
we work collaboratively with our clients  utilizing small teams of consultants with skills in strategy  technology and program management 
during fiscal year we generated million of net revenues before reimbursements of out of pocket expenses from clients 
as of march   we employed client serving professionals and had eleven offices in north america  europe and latin america 
we regularly review our fees for services  professional compensation and overhead costs to ensure that our services and compensation are competitive within the industry  and that our overhead costs are balanced with our revenue level 
in addition  we monitor the progress of client projects with client senior management 
we manage the activities of our professionals by closely monitoring engagement schedules and staffing requirements for new engagements 
however  a rapid decline in the demand for the professional services we provide could result in lower utilization of our professionals than we planned 
in addition  because most of our client engagements are terminable by our clients without penalty  an unanticipated termination of a client project could require us to maintain underutilized employees 
while professional staff levels must be adjusted to reflect active engagements  we must also maintain a sufficient number of senior professionals to oversee existing client engagements and participate in our sales efforts to secure new client assignments

critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we earn revenues from a range of consulting services  including helping organizations worldwide to leverage technology to develop and implement growth strategies  improve operations  and capitalize on technology 
our revenues are comprised of professional fees for services rendered to our clients plus reimbursement of out of pocket expenses 
prior to the commencement of a client engagement  we and our client agree on fees for services based upon the scope of the project  our staffing requirements and the level of client involvement 
we recognize revenue as services are performed in accordance with the terms of the client engagement 
service revenue recognition inherently involves a degree of estimation 
examples of important estimates in this area include determining the level of effort required to execute the project  calculating costs incurred and assessing our progress toward project completion on an ongoing basis 
we believe that these are critical accounting estimates because they can materially effect our revenues and earnings and require us to make judgments about matters that are uncertain 
we utilize a number of management processes to monitor project performance and revenue recognition including monthly reviews of the progress of each project against plan  staff and resource usage  service quality and client feedback 
from time to time  as part of our normal management process  circumstances are identified that require us to revise our estimates of the revenues to be realized on a project 
in most cases  these revisions relate to changes in the scope of the project  and do not significantly impact the expected fees on a contract 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects revenue previously recognized  we record the full effect of the revision in the period when the underlying facts become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred revenue we earn our revenues by providing consulting services to clients 
we bill our clients for these services on either a monthly or semi monthly basis in accordance with the terms of the client engagement 
accordingly  we recognize amounts due from our clients as the related services are rendered and revenue is earned even though we may not be able to bill for those services until a later date 
the terms of our client engagements also require us to assume the risk of non collection of amounts billed to clients 
management makes estimates of the amount of our billed and unbilled accounts receivable that may not be collected from clients 
we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it can materially effect our operating results and requires us to make judgments about matters that are uncertain 
in making these estimates  management specifically analyzes individual client balances  the composition of the aging of accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends  and considers our overall experience with estimating uncollectible amounts 
we recognize the effect of changes in our estimates  assumptions and assessments of the factors impacting the collectibility of amounts due from customers on an ongoing basis 
as of march   our accounts receivable balance was million  including unbilled accounts receivable of million  and net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
unbilled receivables represent revenues earned for services performed that have not been billed 
unbilled receivables are typically billed the following month 
although we and our clients agree on the scope of projects  expected deliverables and related fees in advance  from time to time we have made revisions to the scope of work and deliverables without making a corresponding adjustment to the fees for the project 
we refer to this as project run on as these revisions generally cause a project to extend beyond its targeted completion 
we monitor our actual project run on experience on an ongoing basis and perform monthly reviews of projects in progress against plan 
we provide for project run on costs based on our analysis of historical experience 
these provisions  net of actual costs incurred on completed projects  are reflected in deferred revenue 
as of march   our deferred revenue balance was million 
while we have been required to make revisions to our clients estimated deliverables and to incur additional project costs in some instances  to date there have been no such revisions that have had a material adverse effect on our operating results 
operating expenses the largest portion of our operating expenses consists of project personnel and related expenses 
project personnel expenses consist of payroll costs and related benefits associated with professional staff 
other related expenses include travel  subcontracting  third party vendor payments and unbillable costs associated with the delivery of services to our clients 
the amount of these other direct costs can vary substantially from period to period depending largely on revenue 
however  project personnel and related expenses are relatively fixed in nature  and declines in revenue will often result in reduced utilization of professional personnel and lower operating margins 
the remainder of our recurring operating expenses are comprised of expenses associated with the development of our business and the support of our client serving professionals  such as professional development and recruiting  marketing and sales  and management and administrative support 
professional development and recruiting expenses consist primarily of recruiting and training content development and delivery costs 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with the development and maintenance of our marketing materials and programs 
management and administrative support expenses consist primarily of the costs associated with operations  finance  information systems  facilities  including the rent of office space  and other administrative support for project personnel 
in december  september and december we recorded restructuring charges related to specific actions we took to better align our cost infrastructure with our near term revenue expectations 
we estimated these costs based upon our restructuring plans and accounted for these plans in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the restructuring charges and accruals required certain significant estimates of costs related to severance and other personnel related expenses  as well as costs related to reductions in office space and estimated sublease income to be realized in the future  the write off of associated leasehold improvements  and the establishment of accruals for other contractual commitments which are not expected to provide future benefit 
these estimates and assumptions are monitored on at least a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances 
although we do not expect there to be significant changes to our plans  it is reasonably possible that such estimates could change in the near term due to unanticipated events  resulting in adjustments to the amounts recorded  and the effect could be material 
such revisions will be reflected in the financial statements in the period they occur 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill on april  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets intangibles are no longer subject to amortization  rather they are subject to an assessment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred  but at least annually  by applying a fair value based test 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level  using a discounted cash flow method 
prior to april   the company amortized goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life not to exceed years  and periodically reviewed the recoverability of these assets based on the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
our goodwill was recognized in connection with acquisitions we made in fiscal and the majority of our goodwill related to our acquisition of cluster telecom bv  a pan european consulting firm specializing in wireless technology and digital strategies  which occurred in november under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test requires our management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  the company obtains appraisals from independent valuation firms 
in addition to the use of independent valuation firms  the company performs internal valuation analyses and considers other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows 
this approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and perpetual growth rate  among others 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed our initial impairment review following the guidance in sfas no 
and recorded a million non cash pretax charge for the impairment of goodwill  all of which was generated in the acquisition of cluster telecom bv 
the charge reflected overall market declines since the acquisition was completed in november  was non operational in nature and is reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed the required annual impairment review for goodwill and recorded an additional non cash charge of million  which was recorded as a component of operating income loss in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
this impairment charge was recognized to reduce the carrying value of goodwill at our europe and latin america reporting unit million and our north american reporting unit million 
these charges reflect the units lower than expected performance  including the continued decline in the consulting market  and lower valuations in the consulting industry primarily due to current market conditions and related competitive pressures 
the impairment charges are non cash in nature and do not affect the company s liquidity 
as a result of the charges recognized during the year ended march   the carrying value of our goodwill was reduced to zero at march  valuation of deferred tax assets in determining our current income tax provision we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
when we maintain deferred tax assets we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we record an allowance to reduce the net deferred tax asset to a value we believe will be recoverable by future taxable income 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about the company s future income over the life of the deferred tax asset  and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations 
management s assumptions about future income require significant judgment because actual income has fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so 
in estimating future income  we use our internal operating budgets and long range planning projections 
we develop our budgets and long range projections based on recent results  trends  economic and industry forecasts influencing our performance  our project pipeline  and other appropriate factors 
as a result of net operating losses incurred in fiscal years and  anticipated additional net operating losses for the first quarter of fiscal year  and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of taxable profits in future periods  the company recorded a charge of million to increase the valuation allowance against the net federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets during the fiscal year ended march  as of march   we had a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
new accounting policies on april   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for assets to be disposed of 
this statement establishes a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas no 
 for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
the statement retains most of the requirements of sfas no 
related to the recognition of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
there was no impact on the financial condition or operating results of the company from adopting sfas no 
in fiscal in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
it supersedes the guidance in eitf issue no 
under eitf  an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan 
in sfas  an entity s commitment to a plan does not  by itself  create a present obligation to other parties that meets the definition of a liability 
sfas also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   however  we will continue to follow the guidance of eitf for any changes in our restructuring estimates for the initiatives implemented prior to that date 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force finalized eitf issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
eitf also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
however  it does not address when the criteria for revenue recognition are met or provide guidance on the appropriate revenue recognition convention for a given unit of accounting 
eitf is effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   and early application is permitted 
upon adoption  entities may elect to either apply eitf prospectively or report the change in accounting as a cumulative effect adjustment 
the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment to fasb statement no 
 which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the transition and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we have included the required disclosures in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
as of april  we will begin to account for stock based compensation issued to employees under sfas no 
and related interpretations 
we intend to apply the fair value based method of accounting to awards granted  modified or settled after april  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues year ended march  revenue revenue before out of pocket expense reimbursements net revenue out of pocket expense reimbursements total revenue operating expenses project personnel and related expenses before out of pocket reimbursable expenses out of pocket reimbursable expenses total project personnel and related expenses professional development and recruiting marketing and sales management and administrative support goodwill amortization non cash compensation restructuring charge impairment charge on long lived assets total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax expense benefit loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of income tax benefit net loss fiscal compared to fiscal our net loss of million during fiscal increased million compared to our net loss of million during fiscal  primarily due to the non cash loss related to the impairment in the value of goodwill  the increase in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  and an increase in the operating loss before the impairment or amortization of goodwill  partially offset by decreased goodwill amortization resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal the company applies accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for stock issued to employees 
effective april   the company adopted sfas no

 the company s net loss and diluted loss per share would have increased by million to a net loss of million for the year ended march   or per share 
revenue before out of pocket expense reimbursements net revenue for fiscal was million  down compared with million reported for fiscal total revenue including out of pocket expense reimbursements was million for fiscal  down compared with million reported for fiscal the decline in revenue in fiscal can be principally attributed to the continued weakness in the global economy  resulting in a decline in current demand for the company s services 
the unstable economic conditions have also led to pricing pressures  a lengthening of the company s sales cycle and reductions and or deferrals of client expenditures for consulting services 
clients served in fiscal declined to as compared to clients served in fiscal revenue from new clients accounted for of fiscal revenue as compared to in fiscal revenue from existing clients accounted for of total revenue in fiscal as compared to in fiscal project personnel and related expenses before out of pocket reimbursable expenses decreased million  or  to million during fiscal as compared to million reported for fiscal project personnel and related expenses including out of pocket reimbursable expenses decreased million  or  to million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in project personnel and related expenses reflects savings resulting from cost reduction programs implemented during the third quarter of fiscal and throughout fiscal during the quarters ended december   september  and december   we further reduced personnel as part of the company s restructuring plans 
overall  we reduced our client serving professional staff from at march  to at march  as a percentage of net revenue  project personnel and related expenses before out of pocket reimbursable expenses increased from in fiscal to during fiscal  due primarily to a decline in revenue and lower utilization of personnel 
similarly  project personnel and related expenses including out of pocket reimbursable expenses increased as a percentage of net revenue from in fiscal to during fiscal professional development and recruiting expenses decreased million to million during fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease primarily reflects decreases in our level of recruiting personnel and activities  and decreased training conduct expenditures

goodwill amortization decreased million to zero during fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the company s adoption of sfas no 
on april  as a percentage of net revenues  these expenses decreased from to zero 
non cash compensation increased from during fiscal to million during fiscal non cash compensation expense is primarily the amortization of unearned compensation resulting from the issuance of stock options at prices below fair market value to cluster employees in connection with the cluster acquisition 
the unearned compensation will be earned over time contingent on the continued employment of these employees 
the increase in non cash compensation expense is due to the recognition of million of additional expense related to the remaining unamortized original intrinsic value of certain non vested stock options cancelled by the company on may   pursuant to an offer to employees other than senior officers to surrender certain stock options previously granted to them in exchange for a future grant of new options to purchase the same class of shares 
as a percentage of net revenues  non cash compensation expense increased to as compared to during the prior year primarily due to reduced revenues 
restructuring charge expense increased from million during fiscal year to million during fiscal year in september and december  the company recorded restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  as a result of management s plan to better align the company s operating infrastructure with anticipated levels of business in fiscal and beyond 
combined  the two charges included million for severance and related expenses 
a total of employees were terminated as part of the workforce reductions included in these charges  of whom were project personnel and of whom were operational personnel 
also included in the restructuring charges was million for estimated contractual commitments related to office space reductions 
the office space reductions included the further consolidation of office space in barcelona  boston  chicago  madrid  munich  new york and sao paulo

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company conducted its annual assessment of the carrying value of goodwill 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the carrying value of goodwill to zero 
this impairment charge was recognized to reduce the carrying value of goodwill at our europe and latin america reporting unit million and our north american reporting unit million 
these charges reflect the units lower than expected performance  including the continued decline in the consulting market  and lower valuations in the consulting industry primarily due to current market conditions and related competitive pressures 
the impairment charges are non cash in nature and do not affect the company s liquidity 
as a percentage of net revenues  the impairment charge was 
as of march   the carrying amount of goodwill was zero 
loss from operations increased from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million during fiscal due primarily to the reduced revenues and the goodwill impairment charge  partially offset by decreases in operating expenses as a result of the discontinuation of goodwill amortization effective april  and the cost reduction programs implemented throughout fiscal years and other income decreased million from million in fiscal to million during fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in interest yields and cash balances throughout fiscal year resulting in a decrease in interest income of million  which was partially offset by foreign exchange gains

the company has deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in fiscal year and fiscal year  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards no

management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the gross deferred tax assets 
income tax expense increased from an income tax benefit of million during fiscal year to an income tax expense of million during fiscal year due principally to a non cash charge of million to increase the valuation allowance against the net federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets 
as of march   the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was million  and covered the full amount of the company s net federal  state and international deferred tax assets 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company completed its initial impairment review following the guidance in sfas no 
and recorded a million non cash pretax charge for the impairment of goodwill  all of which was generated in the acquisition of cluster telecom bv 
the charge reflects overall market declines since the acquisition was completed in november  and is reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal compared to fiscal our net loss of million during fiscal increased by million resulting in a net loss of million during fiscal  primarily due to increased amortization of goodwill and non cash compensation costs recorded in connection with the cluster transaction that closed on november   a decrease in operating income before amortization of goodwill and non cash compensation  and costs associated with the restructuring plan implemented in the quarter ended december  revenue before out of pocket expense reimbursements net revenue for fiscal was million  down compared with million reported for fiscal total revenue including out of pocket expense reimbursements was million for fiscal  down compared with million reported for fiscal the decline in revenue in fiscal can be principally attributed to the weakness in the global economy  resulting in a decline in current demand for the company s services

the company expects the restructuring will produce cost savings of million on an annualized basis  of which approximately relates to project personnel and related costs  and approximately relates to other operating expenses 
income from operations decreased from million to a loss of million during fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to the increased amortization of goodwill and non cash compensation  reduced revenue and the restructuring charge 
other income decreased million from million to million during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in cash balances throughout fiscal year resulting in a decrease in interest income of million  which was partially offset by foreign exchange gains and a decrease in realized losses on equity investments

employees who accepted this offer were required to make an election with respect to all covered options by may  in order to receive the new options  the employees were required to remain employed by diamondcluster until november  the exchange offer was not available to the members of the board of directors or senior officers of diamondcluster 
a total of million stock options were surrendered as a part of this plan 
certain of these options had intrinsic value at the original grant date  the unvested portion of which had not been amortized to non cash compensation expense at the date surrendered 
the voluntary surrender of these options resulted in a non cash charge to compensation expense of million during the quarter ended june  relating to the remaining unamortized compensation expense related to these surrendered options 
on november   approximately million new options were granted to employees who remained employed by diamondcluster 
the exercise price for a majority of the options granted on november  was  or of the fair market value of the company s common stock on that date 
on january   we offered our employees other than senior officers a plan  approved by the board of directors  which gave employees a choice to cancel certain stock options granted to them in exchange for a future grant of a lesser number of new options to purchase the same class of shares  a majority of which would vest proportionately over a four year period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sensitive instruments foreign currency risk international revenues are generated primarily from our services in the respective countries by our foreign subsidiaries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country  most of which are the euro 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency  most of which are the euro 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the financial statements of our non us businesses are typically denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
as a result  we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates fluctuate  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected results and profitability 
in the past  the company has entered into transactions to reduce the effect of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses on recorded foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  and to reduce the effect of foreign exchange translation gains and losses on the parent company s net investment in its foreign subsidiaries 
these transactions involve the use of forward foreign exchange contracts in certain european currencies 
as of march   there were no open forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
a forward foreign exchange contract obligates the company to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
as a result  increases or decreases in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency transactions and investments in foreign subsidiaries are partially offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate the possibility of significant foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses 
the company does not use foreign currency contracts for trading purposes 
the company does not currently hedge anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses 
all foreign currency transactions and outstanding forward contracts are marked to market on a monthly basis 
diamondcluster has net investments in foreign operations located throughout europe and latin america 
in order to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on the company s financial position  in some cases the company hedges its euro exposures through the use of euro us dollar forward contracts 
these contracts have been designated and have qualified as hedging instruments of the foreign currency exposure related to the company s net investment in its foreign operations 
accordingly  the net amount of gains or losses on these forward foreign exchange contracts offset losses and gains on the company s exposure to foreign currency movements related to its net investments in its foreign operations and are reflected in the cumulative translation adjustment account and included as a component of other comprehensive income 
at march   the company had one euro us dollar forward contract outstanding in the notional principal amount of eur million 
on june   the company settled its euro us dollar forward contract for eur million 
as noted above  the company entered into this contract to mitigate the effect of an adverse movement of foreign exchange rates 
as a result of the weakening of the us dollar against the euro in the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a net loss on the forward exchange contract of million in the cumulative translation adjustments account which was offset by the related gain on the net investment in the foreign operations during the period 
as of march   there were no open euro us dollar or other forward contracts outstanding 
interest rate risk the company invests its cash in highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less 
the interest rate risk associated with our investing activities at march  is not material in relation to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings
