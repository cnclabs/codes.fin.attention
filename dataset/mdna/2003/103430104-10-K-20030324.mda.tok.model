item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page for a chart of hotel operating data for and application of business strategies maximizing operating cash flow aggressive asset management we closely monitor revenue generation  including rates  group pacing and yield management  and suggest improvements to managers initiatives to improve hotel performance 
we also utilize the smith travel research str reports to evaluate the performance of each of our hotels relative to its competitive set the hotels in its market that compete for the same business 
we work closely with all of our property managers to improve cost control initiatives 
our post september  action plan is an example of these activities 
in response to the decline in travel precipitated by the terrorist attacks  our hotel management companies implemented significant cost cutting initiatives at the property level to partially offset the declines in revenues at our properties 
throughout we continued to monitor the margins at our properties  which resulted in the gross operating profit after management fees of the consolidated hotels operated under the trs structure to be in versus in the prior year 
use of the trs structure we are now able to benefit from the cost reductions in our hotels because we have implemented the trs structure for all but one of our hotel properties 
we believe that the trs structure will enhance our long term performance  better align the interests of our operators with ours  and allow us to benefit from expense management initiatives  which can be implemented and monitored more closely 
in addition  we believe that our flexibility has been significantly enhanced because we can terminate our new management agreements with bmc  interstate and davidson without penalty  while our former percentage leases provided for our payment of significant termination penalties even if we sold a property 

table of contents reinvestment in hotel properties we believe that our regular program of capital improvements at our hotels  including replacement and refurbishment of furniture  fixtures  and equipment  helps maintain and enhance their competitiveness and maximizes their profitability 
consistent with this strategy  we have made significant renovations at several of our hotels in recent years 
in  and we spent million  million and million  respectively  on renovations  excluding the projects at our chicago  illinois and lyndhurst  new jersey hotels which are owned by unconsolidated joint ventures 
this represented  and of  and consolidated hotel revenues  respectively 
strategic brand positioning we maximize our market share and revenue by taking advantage of our sales and marketing orientation to identify the most effective branding strategy for each hotel and to further leverage the selected brands with effective direct sale strategies 
factors we consider in determining the most effective branding strategy are brand strengths and their current presence in the specific market  expected contribution to revenues  expected capital requirements and ongoing costs of the franchise  and strengthening strategic franchisor relationships 
in certain circumstances  we have concluded that operating a hotel independent of a franchise affiliation is the best branding strategy 
such is the case with the french lick springs resort and spa in french lick  indiana  and hotel in chicago 
the remainder of our portfolio contains properties that are currently operated under franchise license agreements with premier nationally recognized hotel chains including marriott  radisson  hilton  embassy suites  doubletree  holiday inn  hampton inn and quality suites 
initiatives to enhance returns on hotels iacc ancillary conference centers we have identified a strategic opportunity to enhance the revenue streams from certain of our existing hotels by developing ancillary conference centers meeting iacc standards within those hotels 
each conference center will be a business unit inside an existing full service hotel  designed to complement the existing transient and group business 
the conference center strategy is attractive to us because it creates demand for our guest and meeting rooms from a new client base  those who prefer to hold meetings at conference centers that meet iacc standards or who otherwise need the types of services provided at iacc conference centers 
iacc requires facilities to meet certain technical standards regarding technology  telecommunications  lighting  sound transmission and other items  which standards appeal particularly to corporate and institutional training programs 
further  the conference center services and pricing are designed on a complete meeting package basis  meaning that the users pay a fixed daily price per person on an all inclusive basis rooms  meals  breaks  telephone services  etc  regardless of utilization  thus making the cost of the services predictable for the planner and the hotel 
the benefit of this pricing structure to us is that we anticipate a higher revpor  meaning revenue per occupied room  because these guests purchase meals and other services at the hotel as a part of their packages 
additionally  we expect higher operating margins from this business segment because predictable utilization of these services results in the achievement of greater operational efficiency 
construction is underway at our first target property  our hotel in berkeley  and we are in the design phase for such facilities at two additional properties 

table of contents property redevelopment and expansion we are undertaking a series of projects at our pink shell beach resort in ft 
myers beach  florida to enhance this resort s position to a four star level and to take advantage of the opportunity to sell portions of the property while retaining long term cash flow 
in  we completed a million renovation of the sanibel view villas  a unit tower  which we have been selling as condominium units 
during  we commenced construction of a second condominium hotel at the resort  a new unit tower to be called white sand villas 
the construction entails eventual removal of cottages  of which had been removed at year end 
the units in the new tower will be sold as condominiums  with the expectation that the owners would put their unused room nights back to the resort by contract 
therefore  in addition to the cash flow generated from selling the units  we expect much of the sold inventory will be placed in our rental program  which will provide us with continuing fee income 
through march   we had entered into contracts for the sales of units for gross proceeds of million 
we have also completed the renovation of the newly renamed hotel in downtown chicago into a four star level independent hotel and the renovation and conversion of our lyndhurst  new jersey property to a courtyard by marriott 
managing our hotel portfolio mix acquiring upscale commercial and resort hotels in key markets our acquisition criteria focuses on hotels in the upper upscale and upscale segments located in major metropolitan markets and destination beach markets 
these markets have historically outperformed other markets because of their high barriers to entry and diversified demand generators 
our current target is greater metropolitan markets including san francisco  boston  new york  washington  dc and los angeles 
our success in implementing this strategy is illustrated by our acquisition of the meadowlands lyndhurst courtyard by marriott in the new york city metropolitan area and hotel in chicago 
we also intend sell selected non core suburban assets or those hotels not in our target markets 
funds for future acquisitions or development of hotels are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from capital obtained from borrowings  from the proceeds of the sale of non strategic hotels  from additional issuances of common shares  preferred shares  or other securities  from potential joint venture partners and from cash flows from operations 
our credit facility permits us to spend up to million for property acquisitions 
disposing of assets to provide capital for better investment opportunities we intend to sell assets that we believe have lower long term growth prospects because of physical characteristics or market location 
due to our efforts in marketing certain of the properties and modifying our loans  in we were able to complete the sale of two properties  the knoxville hilton and the lake norman hampton inn  for total gross proceeds of million 
we intend to maintain a geographically diversified hotel portfolio and may also cluster hotels within certain primary markets in order to take advantage of operational and managerial economies of scale 
we will acquire or develop additional hotel properties only as suitable opportunities arise  and will not undertake acquisition or development of properties unless adequate sources of capital and financing are available and the properties are priced attractively 
optimizing our capital structure and improving financial flexibility managing our leverage and debt service coverage ratios our goal is to maximize shareholder value by strategically using debt and other fixed income instruments  such as preferred equity  to enhance return on common equity while appropriately managing financial risk 
we successfully completed our million offering of preferred depositary shares in october  the net proceeds of which were used to pay down our indebtedness 

table of contents expanding our capital sources we are focused on enhancing our capital structure by diversifying our capital sources 
traditionally  we have utilized secured debt  common equity and joint venture equity to finance our capital needs 
we intend to broaden our sources of capital through increasing our use of alternative sources of debt and equity 
for example  we are financing the construction of white sand villas through a construction loan and we recently issued preferred stock 
we will continue to evaluate the use of other financing structures  such as unsecured debt and convertible securities  relative to our goal of improving financial flexibility and achieving an attractive cost of capital 
when using secured debt  we will seek enhanced flexibility in terms of refinancing options and the ability to allow for substitutions of collateral to facilitate sales of properties 
utilizing secured debt with flexible collateral provisions the majority of our debt is secured by hotel assets  and we anticipate continuing to use secured debt in the future in order to minimize our cost of financing 
our secured financings are generally cross collateralized  however  certain of them contain provisions allowing for substitutions of collateral to facilitate sales of properties 
while these rights in our existing loans are limited  we will seek enhanced flexibility in our future financings 
strategically utilizing joint venture equity the use of joint ventures allows us to further leverage our capital 
we will use joint ventures in instances in which it is strategically advantageous  or to invest in hotels larger than we would consider appropriate for us to acquire without a co venturer in light of the size of our capital base and leverage ratios 
we currently own five hotels in joint venture structures 
our joint venture partners manage four of the hotels and one is managed by bmc

joint ventures with third party hotel operators we have formed joint ventures with our third party lessee operators to align the hotel lessees economic interests with our economic interests 
in certain of these joint ventures  the lessee joint venture partner s ability to receive cash flow and equity capital distributions is subordinated to our receipt of specified minimum distributions 
in addition  certain lessees must maintain a specified net worth to support its lease payment obligations and pledge its joint venture interest as security for the lease payment obligations 
we are permitted to subject any majority owned joint venture s hotel to a mortgage or to sell the hotel or its interest in the joint venture without obtaining the affected joint venture partner s consent

we are subject to disruptions in the lodging industry that would likely result from terrorist attacks actual or threatened or military action affecting the united states 
the uncertainty that would result from these events would likely increase the public s reluctance to travel  which could adversely affect our operations 
competition  economic conditions and similar factors affecting us and the hotel industry generally could affect our performance 
our hotels are subject to all operating risks common to the hotel industry 
these risks include competition for guests from other hotels based upon brand affiliations  room rates  customer service  location and the condition and upkeep of each hotel in general and in relation to other hotels in its local market  adverse effects of general and local economic conditions  dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers  which may fluctuate and be seasonal  increases in energy costs  airline fares  and other expenses related to travel  which may deter travel  impact of financial difficulties of the airline industry and potential reduction in service on the demand for our hotel rooms and collectibility of our outstanding receivables from the airlines  increases in operating costs attributable to inflation and other factors  and overbuilding in the hotel industry  especially in individual markets 
hotel investments are generally illiquid  and we may not be able to sell our hotels when it is economically advantageous to do so 
hotel investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in accordance with our strategies or in response to economic or other conditions 
in addition  provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  limit a reit s ability to sell its properties in some situations when it may be economically advantageous to do so 
risks related to our operations the profitability of our hotels depends on the performance of the hotel management companies 
the profitability of our hotels depends largely upon the ability of the management companies to generate revenues at our hotels in excess of their operating expenses 
the failure of the management companies to manage the hotels effectively would adversely affect our cash flow received from hotel operations 
before january   our cash flow consisted primarily of lease payments from lessees 
our lessees were legally bound to make minimum lease 
table of contents payments even when such payments exceeded the cash flow from the hotel 
since implementing our trs structure on january   the responsibility and risks associated with making the minimum lease payments has shifted to lessees owned by the partnership 
therefore  we have effectively assumed the risks associated with operating shortfalls at our hotels operating under the trs structure 
we depend to a large degree on the performance of bmc 
bmc currently manages of our hotels 
we are therefore dependent to a large degree on the operating performance of bmc 
bmc has expanded in the past months  with the total number of hotels under its management increasing from to during that period 
we cannot provide assurance that bmc will successfully manage the increasing demands that its growth imposes on its management  administrative  operating and financial resources 
changes in management at these hotels or at other hotels in the future could result in temporary service disruptions at the affected hotels  which could in turn affect their operating and financial performance 
we are subject to conflicts of interest involving our chairman and chief executive officer 
our chairman and chief executive officer  robert w 
boykin  and his brother  john e 
boykin  own bmc and therefore derive benefits from bmc s management of of our hotels 
accordingly  mr 
boykin has and will continue to have conflicts of interest with us 
he had conflicts of interest in connection with our january trs transaction and in connection with the structuring of the management agreements for the hotels currently managed by bmc 
he will have similar conflicts on renewal of those agreements and in connection with future management agreements and other transactions that we may enter into with bmc 
conflicts of interest may also arise in connection with bmc s management of our hotels 
under certain circumstances  actions taken and decisions made by bmc to maximize its profits will not necessarily benefit us 
additionally  a subsidiary of bmc provides design services to us for a fee and also receives a portion of the fees we pay to an independent purchasing agent 
mr 
boykin may have conflicts of interest with respect to our procurement of design services and capital goods 
additionally  the sale of certain of our hotels may result in different and more adverse tax consequences to mr 
boykin than would be experienced by boykin lodging and our public shareholders  and he could seek to influence us not to sell a hotel even though that sale might otherwise be financially advantageous to us and our public shareholders 
our articles of incorporation provide that our independent directors are to make all determinations to be made on our behalf with respect to the relationships or opportunities that represent a conflict of interest for any of our officers or directors 
the covenants in our credit agreements may restrict our range of operating activities  and we are subject to refinancing risks 
we have a senior secured credit facility that enables us to borrow up to million and term loans of million  million and million  respectively  each of which is secured by certain of our hotel properties 
our senior secured credit facility and our million term loan require us  among other things  to maintain a minimum net worth  a coverage ratio of ebitda to debt service  a coverage ratio of ebitda to debt service and fixed charges  and a maximum leverage ratio  and place limitations on our distributions and acquisitions 
in addition  the million term loan prohibits the sale of the three hotels securing it  and the million term loan and the million term loan limit our ability to sell some of the hotel properties securing those loans 
these credit arrangements may limit our ability to sell certain hotels whose disposition might be desirable for strategic or financial purposes 
in july  our credit facility and the million term loan mature  management intends to refinance these facilities 
the initial term of the million term loan also expires in july  however  management intends to utilize the first of the two one year extension options available under the terms of the agreement 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our credit arrangements upon maturity on favorable terms or at all 
further  if we are unable to make payments on or to refinance indebtedness secured by our properties  the properties could be foreclosed upon with a consequent loss to us of income and asset value 
a portion of our borrowings bear interest at a variable rate  as may other indebtedness we incur in the future 
accordingly  increases in market interest rates could increase our debt service requirements  which could adversely affect our cash flow 
our need to make unexpected capital expenditures could adversely affect our cash flow 
our hotels require ongoing renovations and other capital improvements  including periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
if necessary capital expenditures exceed our expectations  there can be no 
table of contents assurance that sufficient sources of financing will be available to fund such expenditures 
certain of our financing agreements place limitations on our capital expenditures 
we may also acquire hotels in the future that require significant renovation 
we are subject to risks associated with development  redevelopment and acquisitions of hotels 
new and continued development projects and hotel acquisitions are subject to a number of risks  including the availability of acceptable financing  competition with other entities for investment opportunities  acquired properties failure to achieve anticipated operating results  construction costs of a property exceeding original estimates  overruns with respect to the cost of improvements to bring acquired properties to the requisite standards  and the expenditure of funds on  and the devotion of management time to  transactions that may not come to fruition 
we are subject to the risks associated with investments through joint ventures 
three of our hotels are owned by joint ventures in which we have controlling interests 
we may enter into similar joint ventures in the future 
any joint venture investment involves risks such as the possibility that the co venturer may seek relief under federal or state insolvency laws  or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals 
while the bankruptcy or insolvency of our co venturer generally should not disrupt the operations of the joint venture  we could be forced to purchase the co venturer s interest in the joint venture or the interest could be sold to a third party 
additionally  we have two joint ventures in which we have non controlling interests and we may enter into similar joint ventures in the future 
if we do not have control over a joint venture  the value of our investment may be affected adversely by a third party that may have different goals and capabilities than ours 
it may also be difficult for us to exit a joint venture that we do not control after an impasse 
in addition  a joint venture partner may be unable to meet its economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations 
obligations imposed by our franchise agreements could affect us adversely 
most of our hotels are subject to franchise or license agreements 
the continuation of a franchise or license agreement is generally subject to specified operating standards 
action or inaction on our part or by any of our hotel managers could result in our failure to meet those standards  which could result in the loss of the franchise 
a franchisor also could condition the continuation of a franchise on the completion of capital improvements that we determine are too expensive or otherwise unwarranted in light of general economic conditions or the operating results or prospects of the affected hotel 
in that event  we may elect to allow the franchise agreement to lapse 
in any case  the loss of a franchise agreement could have a material adverse effect upon the operations or the underlying value of the hotel covered by the agreement because of the loss of associated name recognition  marketing support and centralized reservation systems provided by the franchisor  or because of penalties payable upon early termination of the agreement 
additionally  the franchise agreements may place restrictions on the transfer or sale of assets or make such transfers or sales economically infeasible 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover certain risks 
we continue to carry comprehensive liability  fire  flood  earthquake and business interruption policies that insure us against losses within policy specification and insurance limits that we believe are reasonable 
recently  we have also elected under our primary policy to add coverage for terrorist attacks 
there are certain types of risks  generally of a catastrophic nature  that may be uninsurable or are not economically insurable 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose our investment in the affected hotel as well as the anticipated future cash flow from that hotel  while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to that hotel 
additionally  our insurance costs have increased significantly over the last two years 
continued increases in the costs of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our cash flow 

table of contents the costs of complying with laws and regulations could adversely affect our cash flow 
our hotels must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act the ada to the extent that they are public accommodations or commercial facilities as defined in the ada 
noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
if changes in these laws involve substantial expenditures or must be made on an accelerated basis  our cash flow could be adversely affected 
under various federal  state and local laws  an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in the property 
this liability may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the substances 
other laws impose on owners and operators certain requirements regarding conditions and activities that may affect human health or the environment 
failure to comply with applicable requirements could complicate our ability to operate or sell an affected property and could subject us to monetary penalties  costs required to achieve compliance and potential liability to third parties 
we may be potentially liable for such costs or claims in connection with the ownership and operation of our current hotels and hotels we may acquire in the future 
we have not been notified by any governmental authority of  nor are we aware of  any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our hotels 
nonetheless  it is possible that material environmental contamination or conditions exist  or could arise in the future  in the hotels or on the land upon which they are located 
we anticipate that we will incur additional costs for systems  staffing and third party services in maintaining compliance with new federal laws and regulations addressing corporate governance issues and with the proposed new listing requirements of the new york stock exchange 
we bear the risk of the timely completion of the white sand villas project 
each sales contract for the sale of a white sand villa unit provides that the developer  white sand villas development llc  a consolidated subsidiary  guarantees that it will complete construction of the condominium unit within two years following the date of the sales contract unless such failure is due to circumstances beyond the control of the developer 
the first sales contracts for white sand villa units were entered into in january thirty seven of the outstanding contracts were entered into in the first quarter of and eight were entered into in the second quarter of in the event the developer is unable to complete construction of the units by january  the developer would potentially be liable to the first purchaser for damages 
subsequent completion delays would result in the developer being subject to additional damages

these employees perform  directly or through the partnership  various acquisition  development  redevelopment and corporate management functions 
all persons employed in the daily operations of the hotels are employees of the management companies that the lessees have contracted with to operate the hotels

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations boykin s formation and significant events boykin lodging company boykin  an ohio corporation  is a real estate investment trust reit that was formed and completed an initial public offering in to continue and expand the over year history of hotel ownership  acquisition  redevelopment and repositioning activities of its predecessors  boykin management company and its affiliates 
boykin hotel properties  lp  an ohio limited partnership the partnership  is the operating partnership entity that transacts business and holds the direct and indirect ownership interests in boykin s hotels 
as of march   boykin lodging company has an ownership interest in  is the sole general partner of and does all its business through the partnership 
since our initial public offering  we have increased our portfolio by using capital raised through a combination of common share issuances  various debt financings  capital from strategic joint venture partners and cash flow generated from operations 
in october  we completed a million offering of  preferred depositary shares  each representing a interest in one share of our cumulative preferred shares and has a liquidation preference of per share 
dividends are payable quarterly  upon authorization of the board of directors  at an annual rate of per depositary share 
the shares are listed on the new york stock exchange 
proceeds from the offering were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness 
we currently have strategic alliances with four hotel operators and own four hotels with them through joint venture structures 
in  we also formed a joint venture with aew partners iii  lp aew and  through that joint venture we purchased a hotel located in downtown chicago 
at the end of  we had million of debt outstanding under various debt instruments 

table of contents effective january   we took advantage of the restructuring available under the reit modernization act and acquired leasehold interests in hotels from two of our operators 
during  we acquired the leasehold interest in yet another property 
following these transactions  all but one of our hotels are operated under the taxable reit subsidiary trs structure whereby the hotels are leased to a wholly owned subsidiary of the partnership 
at the end of  we owned interests in hotels containing a total of  guestrooms located in different states 
during february  we sold the knoxville hilton and lake norman hampton inn 
therefore  as of march   we own interests in hotels containing  guestrooms located in states 
critical accounting policies the critical accounting policies which we believe are the most significant to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results include the following investment in hotel properties 
hotel properties are stated at cost  net of any impairment charges  and are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years for buildings and improvements and three to years for furniture and equipment 
we review our hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause us to perform our review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located 
when such conditions exist  management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of a hotel property exceed its carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an adjustment to reduce the carrying amount to the related hotel property s estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss recognized 
there were no charges recorded for impairment of real estate in in and  we recorded charges of million and million  respectively  for impairment of real estate on the carrying value of several hotels due to their book value exceeding their net realizable value 
we do not believe that there are any factors or circumstances indicating impairment of any other of our investments in hotel properties at this time 
we estimate the fair market values of our properties through cash flow analysis taking into account each property s expected cash flow generated from operations  holding period and ultimate proceeds from disposition 
in projecting the expected cash flows from operations of the asset  we base our estimates on future projected earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  and deduct expected capital expenditure requirements 
we then apply growth assumptions to project these amounts over the expected holding period of the asset 
our growth assumptions are based on estimated changes in room rates and expenses and the demand for lodging at our properties  as impacted by local and national economic conditions and estimated or known future new hotel supply 
the estimated proceeds from disposition are judgmentally determined based on a combination of anticipated cash flow in the year of disposition  terminal capitalization rate  ratio of selling price to gross hotel revenues and selling price per room 
if actual conditions differ from those in our assumptions  the actual results of each asset s future operations and fair market value could be significantly different from the estimated results and value used in our analysis 
our operating results are also subject to the risks set forth under items c and of this form k 
revenue recognition hotel revenues hotel revenues including room  food  beverage and other hotel revenues are recognized as the related services are delivered 
ongoing credit evaluations are performed and an allowance for 
table of contents potential credit losses is provided against the portion of accounts receivable that is estimated to be uncollectible 
lease revenue through december   our principal source of revenue was lease payments from lessees pursuant to percentage lease agreements 
percentage lease revenue is based upon the room  food and beverage and other revenues of our hotels 
sales of condominium units during  we completed a renovation of a unit tower at the pink shell beach resort 
these renovated units are being sold as sanibel view villas condominiums  with the expectation that the unit owners will make their units available to us by contract for rental as hotel rooms 
the revenue related to the sales of these units is recorded upon closing of the sale 
as of december   we had closed on the sale of of the units within the tower 
as of december   all of the sanibel view unit owners have contracted with us to allow their unused room nights to be rented out as hotel rooms 
the related gross rental income generated by these units is recorded by the resort and included in hotel revenues within the consolidated financial statements 
under the terms of their contracts  a percentage of the gross rental income of each unit is to be remitted to the respective unit owner 
any unsold units are also being rented out as hotel rooms 
with regard to the white sand villa project which was commenced during  revenue will be recorded on the sale of the units under the percentage of completion method of accounting after the project meets certain required criteria 
the appropriate criteria had not been met as of december  income tax valuation allowance 
upon the effective date of the establishment of boykin s trss  the subsidiaries became subject to federal and state income taxes 
boykin s trss account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as of december   boykin s trss have a deferred tax asset of approximately  prior to any valuation allowance  related to the assumption of the retained deficit of westboy as well as the operating losses of the trss and their subsidiaries 
boykin s trss have recorded a valuation allowance against this asset due to the uncertainty of realization of the deferred tax asset and therefore  no provision or benefit from income taxes is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included within this form k 
results of operations we are reporting the hotel operating revenues and expenses with respect to the hotels included within the trs transactions discussed above beginning with their respective effective dates  whereas in the past  we reported percentage lease revenue 
as a result  the results of operations for are not directly comparable to the actual results for the same periods in and results of operations year ended december  compared to pro forma for year ended december   the company s net loss applicable to common shareholders totaled million or per fully diluted share compared with the same period last year when pro forma net loss totaled million  or per share 
revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared with pro forma revenues of million for the same period last year 
hotel revenues were million for the year ended december  compared with pro forma hotel revenues of million for the same period last year 
the decreasing hotel revenues can be attributed to the general softening in the economy and the continued impact on the travel industry from the aftermath of the terrorist attacks and the current political environment 
the following 
table of contents table sets forth the full year operating data of the consolidated properties that were operated under the trs structure as of december  average daily rate adr occupancy revpar chg chg chg consolidated hotels operated by a trs lease revenues decreased approximately million primarily as a result of marriott s hunt valley inn converting to the trs structure effective september  as such  the current year only includes eight months of lease revenue related to that hotel versus a full year for pro forma included in revenues is approximately million related to the sales of sanibel view villas units during the year 
the renovation and conversion of the sanibel view building to condominiums was completed in late  therefore  no sales had occurred in the prior year 
the related costs of the units sold during totaled million and are recorded as such within the financial statements 
for those consolidated hotels operated under the trs structure as of december   the gross operating profit after management fees subsequent to the respective dates of the trs transactions averaged  compared with on a pro forma basis for the previous year 
in we were faced with continued increases in the cost of workers compensation insurance and utilities as well as the need to reserve approximately million of outstanding united airlines receivables at the time of their parent company s  ual corp  bankruptcy filing 
we experienced a million acceleration in depreciation expense during related to the removal of cottages from the pink shell beach resort property to make way for the white sand villas development project 
in  management identified changes in circumstances which indicated that the carrying value of certain properties were impaired  and accordingly recorded a million non cash charge related to eight specific properties 
management did not identify any similar instances and therefore did not take any impairment charges related to any of its properties during during  there was a significant decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt 
additionally  in october  we repaid the entire outstanding balance of our million credit facility and approximately million of the million term note with the proceeds from our preferred depositary share offering 
these factors resulted in an overall decrease in interest expense of million from amortization of deferred financing costs increased million over prior year primarily as a result of the additional financing costs incurred for our march amendments of the million line of credit and the million term loan 
our equity loss in our unconsolidated joint ventures totaled million in versus income of million for the prior year pro forma period 
the change primarily resulted from the impact of the renovation on the operating results of our newly repositioned and renamed hotel in downtown chicago 
the guestroom portion of the renovation was completed late in the third quarter of approximately million of dividends related to the outstanding preferred depositary shares were declared in  those dividends reduced net income applicable to common shareholders 
as the preferred shares were issued during  there was no similar deduction for the year earlier period 
for the full year  funds from operations applicable to common shareholders ffo of million was below the pro forma million reported for the same period last year 
on a fully diluted basis  the full year ffo declined to per share compared with last year s pro forma ffo of per share

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to actual total revenues increased to million from million and hotel revenues increased to million from million  primarily as a result of the trs transaction discussed earlier 
lease revenue decreased to million versus million for because there were only two hotels which were not under the trs structure during after the implementation of this structure at our marriott s hunt valley inn property effective september   there was only one property  hampton inn san diego airport sea world  which was not under the trs structure and was therefore generating lease revenues 
please refer to the year ended december  compared to pro forma section for discussion regarding changes in revenues from sale of condominium units and the related cost of units sold 
similar to total revenues  total operating expenses increased substantially to million for versus million for hotel operating expenses  which include hotel departmental expenses  indirect expenses and management fees  increased to million from million in the prior year due to the inclusion of the results of the properties for which we acquired leasehold interests in connection with the trs transactions 
property taxes  insurance and other expense increased million over prior year due to increases in property and casualty insurance rates and the inclusion of related costs at the hotel property level in our operating results under the trs structure 
we incurred charges of million  million being non cash  during relating to the acquisition and termination of the percentage leases and related transaction costs to implement the trs structure 
such costs were not incurred during please refer to the year ended december  compared to pro forma section above for discussion regarding the impairment charges incurred during and the increase in depreciation 
other items which had significant changes over the prior year include interest expense  amortization of deferred financing costs  our equity in the income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures and the declaration of preferred dividends 
for detailed discussion regarding these changes  please see the year ended december  compared to pro forma section above 
based upon the above  had a net loss applicable to common shareholders of million compared to the million loss for the same period last year 
our ffo for was million compared to million in actual results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended for the year ended december   our net loss totaled million versus net income of million in our percentage lease revenue decreased to million from million in due to the decrease in consolidated hotel revenues 
our percentage lease revenue was driven by hotel revenues which were  in turn  driven by adr  occupancy  and revpar

adr occupancy revpar chg chg chg all hotels hotels a comparable hotels hotels b a includes all hotels we owned at the end of  including predecessors results 
b includes hotels we owned in both periods 
the decrease in hotel revenues from the prior year  and resultant decrease in our lease revenues  resulted from the weak hotel operating environment 
during the first eight months of  lodging demand declined modestly due to the softening economy  following september   the decline in demand was more severe 

table of contents another factor contributing to the decrease in revenues was the sale of the daytona beach radisson resort in january  which generated lease revenues of million in additionally  in february  we took over the radisson hotel mt

our ffo in was million compared to million in liquidity and capital resources our principal source of cash to meet our cash requirements  including dividends to shareholders  is our share of partnership s cash flow from the operations of the hotels 
cash flow from hotel operations is subject to all operating risks common to the hotel industry  including competition for guests from other hotels  adverse effects of general and local economic conditions  dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers  which may fluctuate and be seasonal  increases in energy costs  airline fares  and other expenses related to travel  which may deter traveling  increases in operating costs related to inflation and other factors  including wages  benefits  insurance and energy  overbuilding in the hotel industry  especially in particular markets  and actual or threatened acts of terrorism and actions taken against terrorists that cause public concern about travel safety 
in october  we completed an underwritten public offering of  depositary shares  each share representing of a share of our class a cumulative preferred shares  series a liquidation preference per depositary share 
an additional  depositary shares were issued to cover over allotments 
net proceeds after underwriting discounts and commissions were used to repay the entire outstanding balance on our credit facility and reduce the outstanding balance on the million term loan to just under million 
annual dividends of per depositary share are payable quarterly upon the authorization of the board of directors 
the shares are listed on the new york stock exchange 
we own a corresponding series a preferred equity interest in the partnership that entitles us to income and distributions in amounts equal to the dividends payable on the company s series a preferred shares 
as of december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and million of restricted cash for the payment of capital expenditures  real estate tax and insurance  and deposits received on pre sales of white sand villas condominium units 
there were outstanding borrowings totaling million against our term notes payable at year end 
proceeds from two property sales in february allowed for 
table of contents additional repayment of approximately million on the million term note payable  thereby reducing the outstanding balance to million 
we have not drawn on our credit facility since the october repayment 
we have a million credit facility to fund acquisitions of additional hotels  renovations and capital expenditures  and for our working capital needs  subject to limitations contained in the credit agreement 
for information relating to the terms of our credit facility and our million  million  and million term notes payable  please see notes and  respectively  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of boykin lodging company included in this form k 
our million and million term notes payable are property specific mortgages and pose no covenant compliance issues 
the credit facility and the million term note contain covenant formulas regarding our overall leverage and debt service coverage 
in march  we amended both debt facilities in order to  among other things  ease the leverage and debt service coverage covenants 
in january  our credit facility and the million term note were amended to provide us greater latitude in making capital expenditures and acquisitions  and to moderately tighten our financial covenants 
specifically  we are entitled to use up to million of proceeds under our credit facility for new acquisitions  and our capital expenditures for are now limited to of our total hotel revenues 
in addition  dividends on our common shares cannot exceed the lesser of of our trailing twelve months ffo or million per quarter  subject to certain exceptions  one being that we are entitled to distribute up to of reit taxable income 
based upon our current revpar and cash flow expectations  we expect to be in compliance with our covenants under the amended facilities through their july maturity 
we can give no assurance that our actual results will not differ materially from our expectations 
we may seek to negotiate additional credit facilities  replacement credit facilities  or we may issue debt instruments 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  long term  medium term or short term  bear interest at a fixed or variable rate  and be subject to such other terms as the board of directors considers prudent 
the availability of borrowings under the credit facility is restrained by borrowing base and loan to value limits  as well as other financial performance covenants contained in the agreement 
there can be no assurance that funds will be available in anticipated amounts from the credit facility 
due to our desire to maintain liquidity in the challenging hotel environment following september  our board of directors suspended the regular quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of in august  the board of directors reinstated a regular quarterly dividend on our common shares by declaring a dividend of per common share for the third quarter 
dividends have also been declared for the fourth quarter and first quarter at the same level 
the fourth quarter dividend was paid in january and the first quarter dividend is scheduled to be paid may  to shareholders of record march  while we are committed to a philosophy of regular quarterly dividends  the current economic and geopolitical environment may make it advisable to retain cash in order to enhance our liquidity going forward 
additionally  we are limited by the terms of our amended credit agreement to only distribute of our trailing twelve months ffo through common share dividends 
thus  while we expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend on our preferred shares  the continuation of the common dividend at its current level will depend upon the effect of the economy and geopolitical events on our performance 
in  we expect to spend approximately million related to capital expenditures at our hotels  excluding the pink shell beach resort project discussed below 
this amount includes planned refurbishments and replacements at selected existing hotels as well as revenue generating projects  such as the development of ancillary conference centers within certain properties 
we expect to use cash available from operations and restricted capital expenditure reserves  as well as borrowings under our line of credit to fund our renovations 
we are proceeding with the expansion project at the pink shell beach resort  which will add rooms to the resort 
the project includes demolishing cottage units of which have already been removed and constructing a new unit tower called white sand villas  which will significantly upgrade the character of the resort 
the units in the tower will be sold as condominiums  with the expectation that the owners would put their unused room nights back to the resort by contract  which will provide us with continuing fee income 
total 
table of contents construction costs of the condominium tower are estimated to be approximately million with a scheduled completion date during the fourth quarter of approximately million had been spent through december  to finance the construction of the white sand villas  in january we closed on a million construction loan which is secured by the project 
the loan bears interest at a rate that floats at libor plus basis points and is secured by the project 
while the loan matures in january  it requires principal payments upon closing the sales of the units 
the remaining funding of construction costs will be provided by deposits already collected on pre sales of the condominium units 
we have an active shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of up to million in securities 
securities issued under this registration statement may be preferred shares  depositary shares  common shares or any combination thereof  and may be issued at different times  depending on market conditions 
warrants to purchase these securities may also be issued 
the terms of issuance of any securities covered by this registration statement would be determined at the time of their offering 
no assurance can be made as to the availability of such capital 
inflation operators of hotels in general can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit the operators ability to raise rates to keep pace with inflation 
our general and administrative costs as well as real estate and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance and ground rent are subject to inflation 
seasonality our hotels operations historically have been seasonal 
the four hotels located in florida experience their highest occupancy in the first quarter  while the remaining hotels maintain high occupancy rates during the second and third quarters 
this seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and cash flow received from hotel operations 
competition and other economic factors our hotels are located in developed areas that contain other hotel properties 
the future occupancy  adr and revpar of any hotel could be materially and adversely affected by an increase in the number of or quality of the competitive hotel properties in its market area 
competition could also affect the quality and quantity of future investment opportunities  or our ability to sell existing properties 
as a portion of the lodging industry s sales are based upon business  commercial and leisure travel  changes in general economic conditions  demographics  or changes in local business economics  could affect these and other travel segments 
this may affect demand for rooms  which would affect hotel revenues

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our primary market risk exposure consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our debt instruments that bear interest at variable rates that fluctuate with market interest rates 
these debt instruments include our million secured credit facility no amounts outstanding as of december   the remaining balance on our million secured term loan  our million secured term loan and our share of floating rate debt under our unconsolidated joint ventures of million at year end 
we have entered into both variable and fixed rate debt arrangements to allow us to optimize the balance of using variable rate debt versus fixed rate debt 
our variable rate debt allows us to maximize financial flexibility when selling properties and minimize potential prepayment penalties on fixed rate loans 
our million  fixed rate term note allows us to minimize our interest rate risk exposure 
in march  we also purchased interest protection on million of our floating rate debt that fixes the overall interest rate on this debt at through july approximately of our outstanding debt at december  is fixed rate in nature  compared with at the end of the weighted average interest rate of our variable rate debt was as of december  we review interest rate exposure continuously in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
it is our policy to manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates on our borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments  to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements  and after considering the need for financial flexibility related to our debt arrangements 
we may enter into forward interest rate agreements  or similar agreements  to hedge our variable rate debt instruments where we believe the risk of adverse changes in market rates is significant 
under a forward interest rate agreement  if the referenced interest rate increases  we would be entitled to a receipt in settlement of the agreement that economically would offset the higher financing cost of the debt issued 
if the referenced interest rate decreases  we would make payments in settlement of the agreement  creating an expense that economically would offset the reduced financing cost of the debt issued 
other than the interest protection agreement discussed above  we do not have any other material market sensitive financial instruments 
we do not believe that changes in market interest rates will have a material impact on the performance or fair value of our hotel portfolio as the value of our hotel portfolio is based primarily on the operating cash flow of the hotels  before interest expense charges 
however  a change of in the index rate to which our variable rate debt is tied would change our annual interest incurred by million  based upon the balances outstanding on our variable rate instruments at december
