item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report for the years ended december  and some matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as we believe  anticipate  expect or words of similar import 
similarly  statements that describe our future plans  objectives or goals are also forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated including our ability to manage growth  the availability and integration of acquisition targets  competition  weather conditions  geographic concentration and government regulation 
you should consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
overview waste industries is a regional  vertically integrated provider of solid waste services 
we were founded by members of the current senior management team in we operate primarily in north carolina  south carolina  virginia  tennessee  mississippi  alabama  georgia and florida  providing solid waste collection  transfer  recycling  processing and disposal services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
at december   we operated collection operations  transfer stations  approximately county convenience drop off centers  eight recycling facilities and landfills in the southeastern us we had revenues of million and operating income of million in the year ended december   and revenues of million and operating income of million in the year ended december  our presence in high growth markets in the southeastern us  including north carolina  georgia and virginia  has supported our internal growth 
from through  we acquired  either by merger or asset purchase  solid waste collection or disposal operations 
sixty five of these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases 
accordingly  the results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our financial statements only from the respective dates of acquisition and have affected period to period comparisons of our operating results 
during the year ended december   we did not have any significant acquisitions requiring historical or pro forma financial statements to be presented 
we anticipate that a significant part of our future growth will come from acquiring additional solid waste collection  transfer and disposal businesses and  therefore  we expect that additional acquisitions could continue to affect period to period comparisons of our operating results 
current levels of population growth and economic development in the southeastern us and our strong market presence in the region should provide an opportunity to increase our revenues and market share 
as we add customers in existing markets  our density should improve  which we expect will increase our collection efficiencies and profitability 
results of operations general our branch waste collection operations generate revenues from fees collected from commercial  industrial and residential collection and transfer station customers 
we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial and industrial services that are performed under one year to five year service agreements 
our residential collection services are performed either on a subscription basis with individual households  or under contracts with municipalities  apartment owners  homeowners associations or mobile home park operators 
residential customers on a subscription basis are billed quarterly in advance and provide us with a stable source of revenues 
a liability for future service is recorded upon billing and revenues are recognized at the end of each month in 
index to financial statements which services are actually provided 
municipal contracts in our existing markets are typically awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and thereafter on a bid or negotiated basis and usually range in duration from one to five years 
municipal contracts generally provide consistent cash flow during the terms of the contracts 
our prices for our solid waste services are typically determined by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged in our markets for similar services 
our ability to pass on price increases is sometimes limited by the terms of our contracts 
long term solid waste collection contracts typically contain a formula  generally based on a predetermined published price index  for automatic adjustment of fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs 
at december   we operated approximately convenience sites under contract with counties in order to consolidate waste in rural areas 
these contracts  which are usually competitively bid  generally have terms of one to five years and provide consistent cash flow during the term of the contract since we are paid regularly by the local government 
at december   we also operated eight recycling processing facilities as part of our collection and transfer operations where we collect  process  sort and recycle paper products  aluminum and steel cans  pallets  plastics  glass and other items 
our recycling facilities generate revenues from the collection  processing and resale of recycled commodities  particularly recycled wastepaper 
through a centralized effort  we resell recycled commodities using commercially reasonable practices and seek to manage commodity pricing risk by spreading the risk among our customers 
we also operate curbside residential recycling programs in connection with our residential collection operations in most of the communities we serve 
operating expenses for our collection operations include labor  fuel  equipment maintenance and tipping fees paid to landfills 
at december   we owned  operated or transferred from transfer stations that reduce our costs by improving our utilization of collection personnel and equipment and by consolidating the waste stream to gain more favorable disposal rates 
at december   we owned and operated landfills 
operating expenses for these landfill operations include labor  equipment  legal and administrative  ongoing environmental compliance  host community fees  site maintenance and accruals for closure and post closure maintenance 
cost of equipment sales primarily consists of our cost to purchase the equipment that we resell 
we capitalize certain expenditures related to pending acquisitions or development projects 
indirect acquisition and project development costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
our policy is to charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion thereof that we estimate to be recoverable  through sale or otherwise relating to any operation that is permanently shut down  any pending acquisition that is not consummated and any landfill development project that is not expected to be successfully completed 
engineering  legal  permitting  construction and other costs directly associated with the acquisition or development of a landfill  together with associated interest  are capitalized 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include management salaries  clerical and administrative overhead  professional services  costs associated with our marketing and sales force and community relations expense 
property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method 
other income has not historically been material to our results of operations 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions that could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant estimates and assumptions that are particularly susceptible to a significant change in the future 
index to financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
landfill accounting landfill permitting  acquisition and preparation costs are amortized using a units of production method as permitted airspace of the landfill is consumed 
landfill permitting and preparation costs represent only direct costs related to these activities  including legal  engineering and construction 
landfill preparation costs include the costs of construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms and the installation of leak detection and leachate collection systems 
in determining the amortization rate for a landfill  preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfill s permitted and permittable capacity 
units of production amortization rates are determined annually 
we determine the rates based on estimates provided by our internal and third party engineers  and consider the information provided by surveys that are performed at least annually 
significant changes in our estimates could result in material increases to our landfill depletion rates  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we routinely review our investment in operating landfills to determine whether the costs of these investments are realizable 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
disposal site closure and long term care landfill closure and post closure costs represent an estimate of the current value of the future obligations associated with closure and post closure monitoring of non hazardous solid waste landfills currently owned by us 
closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance costs represent the costs related to cash expenditures yet to be incurred when a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes 
in determining accruals for closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance requirements  we consider final capping of the site  site inspection  groundwater monitoring  leachate management  methane gas control and recovery  and operating and maintenance costs to be incurred during the period after the facility closes 
some of these environmental costs  principally capping and methane gas control costs  are also incurred during the operating life of the site in accordance with the landfill operation requirements of the subtitle d regulations and the air emissions standards 
our accounting personnel and consultants review at least annually the future cost requirements for closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance for our operating landfills 
the impact of changes determined to be changes in estimates  based on the annual update  are accounted for on a prospective basis 
while the precise amounts of these future obligations cannot be determined  at december   we estimate our total landfill closure and post closure costs to range from million to million 
we provide accruals for these estimated costs as the remaining permitted airspace of landfills is consumed 
these costs are expressed in current dollars and are not discounted to reflect anticipated timing of future expenditures 
at december  and  we had accrued approximately million and million for such costs 
significant revisions in the estimated lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of landfill closure and post closure costs could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
derivative financial instruments we formally document our hedge relationships  including identifying the hedge instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction 
our derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  criteria must be met  including a requirement that both at inception of the hedge  and on an ongoing basis  the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge 
when it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting  and any gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recognized in earnings 
long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment on a market by market basis whenever events or changes in the 
index to financial statements circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if an evaluation is required  the projected future net cash flows on an undiscounted basis attributable to each market would be compared to the carrying value of the long lived assets including an allocation of goodwill  if appropriate of that market 
if an impairment is indicated  the amount of the impairment is measured based on the fair value of the asset 
we also evaluate the remaining useful lives to determine whether events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of such lives 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of revenues represented by the individual line items reflected in our statements of operations some items have been reclassified for presentation purposes only year ended december  total revenues service revenues equipment sales total cost of operations selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization organizational costs loss on sale of business units impairment of fixed assets operating income interest expense  net of interest income other income income before income tax expense income tax expense net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase was attributable primarily to the effect of three businesses acquired during the year ended december  and eight businesses and contracts acquired during the year ended december   resulting in an million increase  offset by the decrease in revenues associated with collection operations and hauling assets sold of million and the effect of prices and collection volumes resulting from new municipal and commercial contracts and residential subscriptions  resulting in an increase of million 
total cost of operations 
total cost of operations increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was attributable primarily to increased casualty and worker compensation insurance of approximately million  increased fleet maintenance costs of approximately million  increased labor costs and associated expenses of approximately million  increased landfill maintenance expense of approximately million  offset by decreased landfill and disposal fees of approximately million due to increased internalization 
total cost of operations as a percentage of revenues increased from to for and  respectively 
these increases in operations are primarily the result of the pervasive increase in insurance costs facing all industries  including the waste industry  coupled with the expansion of our existing operations through acquisitions 
sg a 
sg a decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was attributable primarily to enhanced productivity and cost containment strategies employed during the year 
these initiatives resulted in decreased labor costs and related expenses of approximately million  lower bad debt provisions of approximately million and decreased postage fees of  sg a as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in as a result of synergies achieved through acquisitions and enhanced productivity 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  to million in from million in depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in the primary component of this decrease was the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill effective january  organizational costs 
we incurred organizational costs of approximately  for  which were primarily related to our holding company reorganization 
the reorganization enabled us to simplify our organizational structure  segregate for operational and liability purposes our distinct business activities and those of our subsidiaries  allow greater autonomy to companies currently owned or to be acquired by us in the future  and make it easier to implement future secured credit facilities at reduced costs of implementation 
we did not incur these costs in 
index to financial statements loss on disposal of collection and hauling assets 
we recognized a loss on sale of business units totaling approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
these sales were a divestiture of assets in certain markets to better align us for enhanced profitability 
interest expense net of interest income 
interest expense net of interest income decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower average debt levels of million  compared to million in and  respectively 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was attributable to an increase in income before taxes 
net income 
net income increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to increased total revenues  decreased sg a costs  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense net of interest income  offset by increased total operating costs and income tax expense 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase was attributable primarily to the following factors the effect of seven businesses acquired during the year ended december  and three businesses and contracts acquired during the year ended december   resulting in an million increase  offset by the decrease in revenues associated with collection operations sold of million and the effect of prices and collection volumes resulting from new municipal and commercial contracts and residential subscriptions and annexation fees  resulting in an increase of million 
total cost of operations 
total cost of operations increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was attributable primarily to increased insurance expense of approximately million  increased labor costs and associated expenses of approximately million  increased landfill expense of approximately million offset by a decrease of disposal fees of approximately million  increased fleet maintenance costs of approximately million  as well as a million increase due to general costs associated with the acquisition of seven businesses in and three businesses in total cost of operations as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in sg a

sg a as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in from million in the primary components of this increase were the effect of additional depreciation related to the seven businesses acquired during the year ended december  and the three businesses acquired during the year ended december  of million and million resulting from equipment acquired for the operation at the landfills 
the remaining million related to increased property  equipment and landfill site and cell costs due to higher collection volumes 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in organizational costs 
we incurred organizational costs of approximately  and  for and  respectively  which were primarily related to our holding company reorganization 
the reorganization enabled us to simplify our organizational structure  segregate for operational and liability purposes our distinct business activities and those of our subsidiaries  allow greater autonomy to companies currently owned or to be acquired by us in the future  and make it easier to implement future secured credit facilities at reduced costs of implementation 
loss on disposal of collection and hauling assets 
we recognized a loss on sale of business units totaling approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
these sales were a divestiture of assets in certain markets to better align us for enhanced profitability 
interest expense net of interest income 
interest expense net of interest income decreased approximately  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to the lower average interest rate on borrowings of for compared to for and lower average borrowings million for compared to million in 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased approximately  or  to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to a decline in income before income taxes and a decrease in the effective tax rate of approximately from to as a result of our holding company reorganization completed in 
index to financial statements net income 
net income decreased approximately  million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in total cost of operations  insurance expense and depreciation and amortization expense offset by a decrease in income tax expense in liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december  was million and million at december  our strategy in managing our working capital has been to apply the cash generated from operations that remains available after satisfying our working capital and capital expenditure requirements to reduce indebtedness under our bank revolving credit facility and to minimize our cash balances 
we generally finance our working capital requirements from internally generated funds and bank borrowings 
in addition to internally generated funds  we have in place financing arrangements to satisfy our currently anticipated working capital needs in prior to  we had fully drawn our three million term facilities with prudential insurance company of america 
in  we began principal repayments on the first million term facility 
the prudential facilities require us to maintain financial ratios  such as minimum net worth  net income  and limits on capital expenditures and indebtedness 
also  the facility prohibits the payments of cash dividends 
in addition  it requires the lenders approval of acquisitions in some circumstances 
interest on the three prudential facilities is paid quarterly  based on fixed rates for the three facilities of  and  respectively  and the facilities mature as follows million in april  million in june and million in february  subject to renewal 
we maintain a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lending institutions for which fleet national bank  formerly known as bankboston  na  acts as agent 
this credit facility provides up to million through november virtually all of our assets  and those of our subsidiaries  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries  secure our obligations under the fleet credit facility 
pursuant to an intercreditor agreement with fleet  prudential shares in the collateral pledged under the fleet credit facility 
in addition  our subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the prudential term loan facilities 
the fleet credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either a fleet base rate or at the eurodollar rate based on eurodollar interbank market rates plus  in each case  a percentage rate that fluctuates  based on the ratio of our funded debt to ebitda income before income taxes plus interest expense and depreciation and amortization  from to for base rate borrowings and to for eurodollar rate borrowings 
the fleet facility requires us to maintain financial ratios and satisfy other requirements  such as minimum net worth  net income  and limits on capital expenditures and indebtedness 
also  the facility prohibits the payments of cash dividends 
in addition  it requires the lenders approval of acquisitions in some circumstances 
as of december   million was outstanding under the fleet credit facility  and the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was approximately 
on april   we closed on a variable rate development bond with sampson county sampson facility 
this bond provides up to million of income tax exempt funding 
as of december   an aggregate of approximately million was outstanding under the sampson facility 
these funds were drawn to repay funds borrowed from the fleet syndication used to finance the original sampson county landfill acquisition 
the bonds are backed by a letter of credit issued by wachovia bank trust as a participating lender under our fleet syndication 
the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the sampson facility was approximately at december  as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions related to all outstanding borrowings 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands 
index to financial statements payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years over years long term debt expected aggregate environmental liabilities operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations as of december   our fleet credit facility allows us to borrow up to million provided we are in compliance with loan covenants 
environmental liabilities are based on current costs and include final closure  post closure and environmental remediation costs 
amount of commitment expiration per period commerical commitments total amounts committed less than year to years to years over years standby letters of credit performance bonds total commericial commitments net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  that consisted primarily of net income of million plus non cash adjustments eg depreciation and amortization  etc 
of million  offset by a reduction in working capital 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million 
of this  million was used to fund the cash portion of acquisitions and million was used to fund capital expenditures  which was primarily for investments in property and equipment  consisting primarily of trucks  containers and other equipment 
cash inflows from investing activities included million received from the sale of property and equipment 
capital expenditures were million for compared to million in in  we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  including million for vehicle and equipment additions and replacements  approximately million for landfill site and cell development  approximately million for support equipment and approximately million for facilities  additions and improvements 
we expect to fund our planned capital expenditures principally through internally generated funds and borrowings under existing credit facilities 
as an owner and potential acquirer of additional new landfill disposal facilities  we might also be required to make significant expenditures to bring newly acquired disposal facilities into compliance with regulatory requirements 
we might also be required to make significant expenditures to obtain permits for newly acquired disposal facilities or expand the available disposal capacity at any newly acquired disposal facilities 
we cannot currently determine the amount of these expenditures because they will depend on the nature and extent of any acquired landfill disposal facilities  the condition of any facilities acquired and the permitting status of any acquired sites 
we expect we would fund any capital expenditures to acquire solid waste collection and disposal businesses and any regulatory expenses for newly acquired disposal facilities  to the extent we could not fund such acquisitions with our common stock  through borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
we have financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs  or long term care  or remediation of disposal facilities we operate or for which we are or might become responsible 
landfill closure and post closure costs include estimated costs to be 
index to financial statements incurred for final closure of landfills and estimated costs for providing required post closure monitoring and maintenance of landfills 
we estimate  these future cost requirements based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the epa s subtitle d regulations 
while we cannot determine the precise amounts of these future obligations  at december   we estimate the total costs to be approximately million to approximately million for remediation  final closure of our operating facilities and post closure monitoring costs 
our estimate of these costs is expressed in current dollars and is not discounted to reflect anticipated timing of future expenditures 
we provide accruals for these future costs generally for a term of years after final closure of any landfill  and will provide additional accruals for these and other landfills we might acquire or develop in the future  based on engineering estimates of consumption of airspace over the useful lives of such facilities 
there can be no assurance that our ultimate financial obligations for actual closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to insurance policies or trust funds 
such a circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the total costs for remediation  final closure of our operating facilities and post closure monitoring costs 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was million  which included net repayments under long term debt including capital leases of million 
at december   we had approximately million of long term and short term borrowings outstanding including capital leases and approximately million in letters of credit including performance bonds 
at december   the ratio of our total debt including capital leases to total capitalization was  compared to at december  new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
under sfas  the use of the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  is prohibited 
this statement also changes the criteria for the recognition of acquired intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas apply to all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method of accounting completed after june  the adoption of sfas had no impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminates amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful life and instead requires an impairment only approach 
at adoption  any goodwill impairment loss is recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
subsequently  any impairment losses are recognized as a component of income from operations 
as required  we adopted sfas no 
effective january   which has resulted in the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
we determined we operate in one reporting unit based on the current reporting structure and  accordingly  have assigned goodwill at the enterprise level 
we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test by comparing the enterprise fair value to its carrying value and have determined that no impairment exists at the adoption date 
a reconciliation of previously reported net income and per share amounts adjusted for the exclusion of goodwill net of the related income tax effect is as follows in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  reported net income add back goodwill amortization  net of taxes adjusted net income basic earnings per common share reported net income add back goodwill amortization  net of taxes adjusted net income diluted earning per common share report net income add back goodwill amortization  net of taxes adjusted net income effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and accounting principles board no 
 reporting the results of operation reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
effective september   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement was issued to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results see note m the amendments to sfas no 
in paragraphs a e of this statement were effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
applies to all legally enforceable obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and provides the accounting and reporting requirements for such obligations 
sfas no 
requires amounts initially recognized as an asset retirement obligation to be measured at fair value 
the recognized asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the cost of the asset and is depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
sfas will require us to change the methodology we currently use to record closure and post closure costs related to our landfills 
the most significant change to our methodology required by sfas is inflating and discounting our obligations to reflect today s dollars 
sfas no 
 which will primarily impact the accounting for our landfill operations  does not change the basic landfill accounting followed historically by us along with others in the waste industry 
in general  the waste industry has recognized expenses associated with both amortization of capitalized costs and future closure and post closure obligations on a units of consumption basis 
index to financial statements as airspace is consumed over the life of the related landfill 
this practice  referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry  will continue to be followed upon adoption of sfas no 
 except as discussed below 
under sfas  obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill will be recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event 
obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations will be recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire landfill 
landfill retirement obligations will be capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed throughout the entire landfill  depending upon the nature of the obligation 
all obligations will be initially measured at estimated fair value 
fair value will be calculated on a present value basis using our credit adjusted  risk free rate 
upon adopting sfas no 
 we will no longer record closure and post closure expense as a component of cost of operations 
instead  amortization expense will be recorded on the capitalized portion of the obligation and accretion expense will be recorded using the effective interest method 
upon adoption  sfas no 
requires a cumulative change in accounting for landfill obligations retroactively to the date of the inception of the landfill 
inception of the asset retirement obligation is the date operations commenced or the date the asset was acquired 
to do this  sfas no 
requires the creation of the related landfill asset  net of accumulated amortization and an adjustment to the final capping  closure and post closure liability for cumulative accretion 
the adjustments that occur upon adoption are required to be accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we will adopt sfas no 
beginning january  and  based on current estimates  will record an after tax expense of approximately million as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
requires that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in accounting principles board opinion no 
applying the provisions of opinion no 
will distinguish transactions that are part of an entity s recurring operations from those that are unusual and infrequent and meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item 
sfas no 
was effective for us beginning january  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  such as restructurings  involuntarily terminating employees  and consolidating facilities initiated after december  the implementation of sfas no 
will not require the restatement of previously issued financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
it clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee  including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the objective of the initial measurement of the liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are effective for us on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or amended after december  we will record the fair value of future material guarantees  if any 
we do not believe the implementation of fin will have a significant impact on our financial results 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires that unconsolidated variable interest entities must be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries 
a primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses or residual benefits 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to existing variable interest entities in the periods beginning after june  we have not determined the impact  if any  that the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our results of operations tend to vary seasonally  with the first quarter typically generating the least amount of revenues  higher revenues in the second and third quarters  and a decline in the fourth quarter 
this seasonality reflects the lower volume of waste during the fall and winter months 
also  operating and fixed costs remain relatively constant throughout the calendar year  which  when offset by these revenues  results in a similar seasonality of operating income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk quantitative disclosures 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective january  to modify the interest characteristics of our outstanding long term debt and have designated the qualitative instrument as a cash flow hedge 
under the terms of the agreement  the interest rate swap has a notional value of million with a fixed rate of 
the agreement expires november we have used heating oil option agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in diesel fuel oil prices 
to date  such agreements have not been significant to our financial condition and results of operations 
there were no open option agreements at december  
index to financial statements the following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates of our long term debt at december  by expected maturity dates 
fair values have been determined based on quoted market prices as of december  our market risk exposure has not changed materially during the months ended december  thereafter total in thousands fixed rate variable rate qualitative disclosures 
our primary exposure relates to interest rate risk on long term and short term borrowings  the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet interest expense requirements and exceed financial covenants  and the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future acquisitions 
we manage interest rate risk on outstanding long term and short term debt through the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on existing debt  we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis
