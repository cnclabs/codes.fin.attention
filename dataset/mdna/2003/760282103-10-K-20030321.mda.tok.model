table of contents credit risk management extending credit to businesses and consumers exposes the company to credit risk 
credit risk is the risk that the principal balance of a loan and any related interest will not be collected due to the inability of the borrower to repay the loan 
the company manages credit risk in the loan portfolio through adherence to consistent underwriting standards  guidelines and limitations established by senior management 
written loan policies establish underwriting standards  lending limits and other standards or limits as deemed necessary and prudent 
various approval levels  based on the amount of the loan and whether the loan is secured or unsecured  have also been established 
loan approval authority ranges from the individual loan officer to the directors loan committee 
republic bank has established loan review and quality control functions to conduct ongoing  independent reviews of the lending process 
this group ensures adherence to established policies and procedures  monitors compliance with applicable laws and regulations  provides objective measurement of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  and ensures that proper documentation exists 
the following discussion summarizes the underwriting policies and procedures for the major categories within the loan portfolio and addresses the company s strategies for managing the related credit risk 
commercial loans credit risk associated with commercial loans is primarily influenced by prevailing economic conditions and the level of underwriting risk the company is willing to assume 
to manage credit risk when extending commercial credit  the company focuses on adequately assessing the borrower s ability to repay and by obtaining sufficient collateral 
to minimize credit risk  the company concentrates its commercial lending efforts on commercial real estate loans 
at december   commercial real estate loans accounted for of total commercial loans 
emphasis is also placed on loans that are government guaranteed  such as sba loans 
commercial loans are generally secured by the borrower s assets at a or less loan to value ratio and by personal guarantees 
management closely monitors the composition and quality of the total commercial loan portfolio to ensure that significant credit concentrations by borrower or industry do not exist 
residential real estate mortgage loans the company originates fixed rate and variable rate residential mortgage loans which are secured by the underlying family unit residential property 
at december   these loans accounted for of total portfolio loans 
credit risk in this area of lending is minimized by the assessment of the creditworthiness of the borrower  including debt to income ratios  credit bureau scores and adherence to underwriting policies that emphasize conservative loan to value ratios of generally no more than 
residential mortgage loans granted in excess of the loan to value ratio criterion are generally insured by private mortgage insurance  unless otherwise guaranteed or insured by the federal or state government 
credit risk is further reduced since the majority of the company s fixed rate mortgage loan production is sold to investors in the secondary market without recourse 
installment loans credit risk in the installment loan portfolio is controlled through consistent adherence to conservative underwriting standards that consider  but are not necessarily limited to  debt to income levels  past payment tendencies as evidenced by credit bureau reports  and loan to value ratios as to any collateral 
asset quality non performing assets non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  restructured loans and other real estate owned oreo 
oreo represents real estate properties acquired by the company through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure 
commercial loans  residential real estate mortgage loans and installment loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is days or more past due  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
in all cases  loans may be placed on non accrual status earlier when  in the opinion of management  reasonable doubt exists as to the full  timely collection of interest or principal 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest accruals cease and any uncollected interest is charged against current income 
interest subsequently received on non accrual loans is applied against the principal balance

the increase in non accrual commercial loans was due primarily to two commercial real estate loan relationships located in michigan and indiana 
the company believes the risk allocated allowance for loan losses attributable to these loans is adequate

table of contents impaired loans sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 considers a loan impaired when it is probable that payment of principal and interest will not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the original loan agreement 
consistent with this definition  all non accrual and restructured loans with the exception of residential mortgage and consumer installment loans are impaired 
an impaired loan for which it is deemed necessary to record a specific allocated allowance may be written down to the fair value of the underlying collateral via a direct charge off against the allowance for loan losses at the time it is determined the loan balance exceeds the fair value of the collateral 
consequently  those impaired loans not requiring a specific allocated allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the underlying collateral equaled or exceeded the recorded investment in the loan 
all impaired loans were evaluated using the fair value of the underlying collateral as the measurement method 
at december  and  the gross recorded investment in impaired loans totaled million and million  respectively 
similar to non accrual loans  interest payments subsequently received on impaired loans are applied against the principal balance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impaired loans 
provision and allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents the company s estimate of probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an adequate level through additions to the provision for loan losses 
an appropriate level of the risk allocated allowance is determined based on the application of risk percentages to graded loans by categories 
specific reserves are established for individual loans when deemed necessary by management 
in addition  management considers other factors when determining the unallocated allowance  including loan quality  changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  consultation with regulatory authorities  amount of nonperforming loans  delinquency trends and economic conditions and industry trends 
it must be understood  however  that inherent risks and uncertainties related to the operation of a financial institution require management to depend on estimates  appraisals and evaluations of loans to prepare the company s financial statements 
changes in economic conditions and the financial prospects of borrowers may result in abrupt changes to the estimates  appraisals or evaluations used 
in addition  if actual circumstances and losses differ substantially from management s assumptions and estimates  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to absorb all future losses  and net income could be significantly impacted 
gross loan charge offs increased million to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in is primarily due to increases in the company s commercial loan charge offs  which have been impacted by growth in the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio and the overall economy in the company s primary market areas of michigan  ohio and indiana 
based on these factors  the company may have a similar loss experience on such loans in the future

the risk percentages are developed by the company in consultation with regulatory authorities  actual loss experience  peer group loss experience and are adjusted for current economic conditions 
the risk percentages are considered a prudent measurement of the risk of the company s loan portfolio 
such risk percentages are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
the company reviews each delinquent commercial loan on a bi weekly basis 
grades for commercial loans are assigned based upon review of such factors such as debt service coverage  collateral value  financial condition of the borrower  experience and reputation of management and payment history 
delinquent mortgage and installment loans are reviewed monthly and assigned a rating based on their payment status 
in addition  the commercial loan review committee will  on a monthly basis  conduct reviews of certain individual loans exceeding  that have not exhibited delinquency trends 
these reviews assign a current risk rating based on the financial condition of the borrower and collateral values 
based upon these reviews  the company determines the grades for its loan portfolio on a monthly basis and computes the allocation for allowance for loan losses 
these reviews provide a mechanism that results in loans being graded in the proper category and accordingly  assigned the proper risk percentage in computing the risk allocated or specific allocated allowance

repurchased shares will be used for employee benefit plans  stock dividends and other general business purposes  including potential acquisitions 
the company repurchased  shares and  shares under the program during and  respectively 
the company repurchased  shares and  shares under the program during and  respectively 
as of december   there were  shares available for repurchase under the program 
the company is subject to risk based capital adequacy guidelines that measure capital relative to risk weighted assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
capital adequacy guidelines issued by the federal reserve board require bank holding companies to have a minimum total risk based capital ratio of  with at least half of total capital in the form of tier  or core capital 
the company s total risk based capital ratio was at december  compared to at december  for further information regarding regulatory capital requirements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to provide funds at an acceptable cost to meet loan demand and deposit withdrawals and to service other liabilities as they become due 
managing liquidity also enables the company to take advantage of opportunities for business expansion 
funds are available from a number of sources  including  but not limited to  cash and money market investments  the investment securities portfolio  mortgage loans held for sale and portfolio loan repayments and maturities 
short term liquidity is available from federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreement to repurchase  deposit growth  retail  brokered and municipal certificates of deposit and fhlb advances 
long term liquidity is generated from securities sold under agreement to repurchase  deposit growth  the maturity structure of time deposits  brokered certificates of deposit and fhlb advances 
as of december  the company s balance of certificates of deposit maturing within the next twelve months was million 
the company expects that a significant portion of these certificates of deposit will be renewed based on the company s success at establishing long lasting customer relationships 
however  the company will use its other available funding sources to replace those deposits which are not renewed 
at december   republic bank had available million in unused lines of credit with third parties for federal funds purchased and million available in unused borrowings with the fhlb 
republic bancorp inc has four major funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements interest earning deposits  dividends from republic bank  access to the capital markets and a revolving credit agreement with a third party 
on december   million was available from republic bank for payment of dividends to the parent company without prior regulatory approval  compared to million at december  also  at december   the parent company had interest earning deposits of million at republic bank to meet any liquidity requirements 
in december  the company entered into a million revolving credit agreement with a third party with a floating interest rate based on libor 
there were no advances outstanding under the agreement at december   which expires on december  depending on market conditions and liquidity requirements  the company would also consider the issuance of additional debt instruments to provide additional liquidity  if necessary 

table of contents as discussed in item of this report on form k  republic bank is subject to statutory and regulatory requirements and  among other things  may be limited in their ability to pay dividends to the parent company 
these statutory and regulatory restrictions have not had  and are not expected to have  a material effect on the company s ability to meet its cash obligations 
forward looking statements the disclosures on pages appearing under market risk management contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements involve certain risks  uncertainties  estimates and assumptions by management  which may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements 
for a discussion of certain factors that may cause such forward looking statements to differ materially from actual results  see item of this document 
market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
the company s market risk exposure is composed entirely of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid withdrawn  reprice or mature in specified periods 
asset and liability management the primary objective of asset and liability management is to maintain stability in the level of net interest income by producing the optimal yield and maturity mix of assets and liabilities within the interest rate risk limits set by the company s asset and liability management committee alco and consistent with projected liquidity needs and capital adequacy requirements 
interest rate risk management the company s alco  which meets weekly  is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
senior management at republic bank is responsible for ensuring that the bank asset and liability management procedures adhere to corporate policies and risk limits established by their respective board of directors 
during  both short term and long term interest rates decreased 
the three month treasury bill decreased basis points and the prime lending rate decreased basis points from december  to december   while the year treasury bond decreased basis points during the demand for residential loans continued to be high during as mortgage rates remained historically low 
the company s residential real estate mortgage balance increased during the year  as new mortgage loan production more than offset loan payoffs within the portfolio 
commercial lending continued to be strong due to the successful efforts by our team of experienced commercial lenders and the lower prime lending rates 
lower interest rates also continued to attract home equity borrowers as the balance of consumer direct loans grew in the mortgage loans held for sale balance is the company s most interest rate sensitive asset 
it is also short term in nature as the majority of loans held for sale are sold within days 
by funding this balance with primarily short term borrowings  the company is able to closely match its liquidity needs  as this balance will generally increase in a declining interest rate environment and decrease in a rising interest rate environment  and maintain a consistent interest rate spread when the yield curve moves in parallel shifts 
as is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  committing to fund residential real estate loan applications at specified rates and holding residential mortgage loans for sale exposes the company to market risk during the period after the loans close but before they are sold to investors 
to minimize this exposure to market risk  the company enters into firm commitments to sell such mortgage loans at specific future dates and prices to various third parties 
the company utilizes two complementary quantitative tools to measure and monitor interest rate risk static gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling 
each of these interest rate risk measurements has limitations  but when evaluated together  they provide a reasonably comprehensive view of the exposure the company has to interest rate risk 

table of contents static gap analysis static gap analysis is utilized at the end of each month to measure the amount of interest rate risk embedded in the balance sheet as of a point in time 
the company undertakes this analysis by comparing the differences in the repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
a gap is defined as the difference between the principal amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that reprice within a specified time period 
this gap provides a general indication of the sensitivity of the company s net interest income to interest rate changes 
if more assets than liabilities reprice or mature in a given period  resulting in an asset sensitive position or positive gap  increases in market interest rates will generally benefit net interest income because earning asset rates will reflect the changes more quickly than rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
alternatively  where interest bearing liabilities reprice more quickly than interest earning assets  resulting in a liability sensitive position or negative gap  increases in market interest rates will generally have an adverse impact on net interest income 
at december   the cumulative one year gap was a positive of total earning assets 
at december   the cumulative one year gap was a positive of total earning assets 
the company s current policy is to maintain a mix of asset and liabilities with repricing and maturity characteristics that permit a moderate amount of short term interest rate risk based on current interest rate projections  customer credit demands and deposit preferences 
the company generally operates in a range of zero to of total earning assets for the cumulative one year gap 
management believes that this range reduces the vulnerability of net interest income to large shifts in market interest rates while allowing the company to take advantage of fluctuations in current short term rates 
this range also complements the company s strong retail mortgage banking franchise 
the one year gap at december  exceeds this range primarily due to the prepayment assumption the model uses in estimating the maturity terms of the residential mortgage portfolio 
with residential mortgage rates at historical lows  prepayment speed assumptions are at high levels resulting in a high level of assumed maturities within the one year period 
a slow down in prepayment speed assumptions to more normalized levels would significantly reduce the one year gap percentage 
earnings simulation on a monthly basis  the earnings simulation model is used to quantify the effects of various hypothetical changes in interest rates on the company s projected net interest income over the ensuing twelve month period 
the model permits management to evaluate the effects of various parallel shifts of the us treasury yield curve  upward and downward  on net interest income expected in a stable interest rate environment ie  base net interest income 
as of december   the earnings simulation model projects the following change in net interest income from base net interest income  assuming an immediate parallel shift in market interest rates change in market interest rates in basis points change in net interest income over the next twelve months these projected levels are well within the company s policy limits 
these results portray the company s interest rate risk position as asset sensitive for the one year horizon 
the earnings simulation model assumes that current balance sheet totals remain constant and all maturities and prepayments of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are reinvested at current market rates 
impact of interest rate fluctuations and inflation on earnings unlike most industrial companies  substantially all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rate fluctuations generally have a more significant and direct impact on a financial institution s performance than do the effects of inflation 
to the extent inflation affects interest rates  real estate values and other costs  the company s lending activities may be adversely impacted 
significant increases in interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential property and to qualify for mortgage loans 
as a result  the company s volume of loans originated may be reduced and the potential reduction in the related interest income and fee income may be larger than would be implied by a simple linear extrapolation of the results generated by the earnings simulation model 
a lower interest rate environment would enable more potential borrowers to reduce their mortgage interest rate and qualify for relatively higher mortgage loan balances  therefore resulting in higher mortgage loan production activity as well as interest income

table of contents accounting and financial reporting developments in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
as of december  the company had no variable interest entities 
the company does not expect fin to have any impact on the financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which provides guidance on how to transition from the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under apb to sfas s fair value method of accounting  if a company so elects 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value method of recording stock options under sfas in accordance with the transitional guidance of sfas  the fair value method of accounting for stock options will be applied prospectively to awards granted subsequent to january  as permitted  options granted prior to january  will continue to be accounted for under apb opinion  and the pro forma impact of accounting for these options at fair value will continue to be disclosed in the consolidated financial statements until the last of those options vest in the company uses the black scholes model to estimate option values 
in  the company anticipates issuing restricted stock in lieu of stock option grants 
as a result  the company estimates the income statement impact associated with expensing stock options in will be immaterial 
the actual impact per diluted share may vary in the event the fair value or the number of options granted increases from the current estimate  or if the current accounting guidance changes 
the company continues to recognize compensation expense for restricted stock over the vesting period in accordance with apb opinion no 
such expense is included in salaries and employee benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation expands the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
fin applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset  liability  or equity security of the guaranteed party 
guarantees subject to the disclosure requirements of fin but not to the recognition provisions include  among others  a guarantee accounted for as a derivative instrument under sfas  a parent s guarantee of debt owed to a third party by its subsidiary or vice versa  and a guarantee which is based on performance not price 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for the company as of december   and require disclosure of the nature of the guarantee  the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee  and the current amount of the liability  if any  for the guarantor s obligations under the guarantee 
the recognition requirements of fin are to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  significant guarantees that have been entered into by the company are disclosed in note the company does not expect the requirements of fin to have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas  acquisitions of certain financial institutions  which provides guidance on the accounting for the acquisition of a financial institution and supersedes the specialized accounting guidance provided in sfas  accounting for certain acquisitions of banking or thrift institutions 
sfas became effective upon issuance and requires companies to cease amortization of unidentified intangible assets associated with certain branch acquisitions and reclassify these assets to goodwill 
sfas also modifies sfas to include in its scope long term customer relationship intangible assets and thus subject those intangible assets to the same undiscounted cash flow recoverability test and impairment loss recognition and measurement provisions required for other long lived assets 
while sfas may affect how future business combinations  if undertaken  are accounted for and disclosed in the financial statements  the issuance of the new guidance had no effect on results of operations  financial position  or liquidity because the company does not have any assets subject to the specialized accounting guidance provided in sfas or sfas 
table of contents sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was issued in july and becomes effective for the company beginning january  this statement requires a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity  such as the sale or termination of a line of business  the closure of business activities in a particular location  or a change in management structure  to be recorded as a liability at fair value when it becomes probable the cost will be incurred and no future economic benefit will be gained by the company for such cost 
applicable costs include employee termination benefits  contract termination costs  and costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
sfas supersedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  which in some cases required certain costs to be recognized before a liability was actually incurred 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets  was issued in october and addresses how and when to measure impairment on long lived assets and how to account for long lived assets that an entity plans to dispose of either through sale  abandonment  exchange  or distribution to owners 
the statement s provisions supersede sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which addressed asset impairment  and certain provision of apb opinion related to reporting the effects of the disposal of a business segment and requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be recorded in the period in which the losses are incurred rather than the measurement date 
under sfas  more dispositions may qualify for discontinued operations treatment in the income statement 
the provisions of sfas became effective for the company on january   and did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas requires an entity to record a liability for an obligation associated with the retirement of an asset at the time the liability is incurred by capitalizing the cost as part of the carrying value of the related asset and depreciating it over the remaining useful life of that asset 
the standard is effective for the company beginning january  and its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these statements drastically change the accounting for business combinations  goodwill  and intangible assets 
statement no 
eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations except for qualifying business combinations that were initiated prior to july  statement no 
further clarifies the criteria to recognize intangible assets separately from goodwill 
the requirements of statement no 
are effective for any business combination accounted for by the purchase method that is completed after june  ie  the acquisition date is july  or after 
under statement no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the amortization provisions of statement no 
apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   companies are required to adopt statement no 
in their fiscal year beginning after december  at december   the company s goodwill balance was million and intangible asset balance was million 
as a result  the adoption of these statements did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company
