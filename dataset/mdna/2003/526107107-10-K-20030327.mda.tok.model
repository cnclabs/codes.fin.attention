item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company participates in four reportable business segments of the hvacr industry 
the first reportable segment is residential heating and cooling  in which lii manufactures and markets a full line of heating  air conditioning and hearth products for the residential replacement and new construction markets in the united states and canada 
the second reportable segment is commercial heating and cooling  in which lii manufactures and sells primarily rooftop products and related equipment for commercial applications 
combined  the residential and commercial heating and cooling segments form lii s heating and cooling business 
the third reportable segment is service experts  which includes sales and installation of  and maintenance and repair services for  hvacr equipment by approximately lii owned service centers in the united states and canada 
the fourth reportable segment is refrigeration  which consists of unit coolers  condensing units and other commercial refrigeration products 
during august  lii formed joint ventures with outokumpu oyj of finland outokumpu 
outokumpu purchased a percent interest in the company s former heat transfer business segment in the us and europe for million in cash and notes  with lii retaining percent ownership 
the net after tax gain on the sale and the related expenses and charges was million 
lii accounts for its remaining percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting 
the company currently reports the historical results of operations of its former heat transfer business segment in the corporate and other business segment 
for a more detailed discussion of this sale  see results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  gains losses and other expenses 
lii s customers include distributors  installing dealers  property owners  national accounts and original equipment manufacturers 
the demand for lii s products and services is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors  such as interest rates  the availability of financing  regional population and employment trends  new construction  general economic conditions and consumer confidence 
in addition to economic cycles  demand for lii s products and services is seasonal and dependent on the weather 
hotter than normal summers generate strong demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and colder than normal winters have the same effect on heating products 
conversely  cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress sales of hvacr products 
the principal components of cost of goods sold in lii s manufacturing operations are component costs  raw materials  factory overhead  labor and estimated costs of warranty expense 
in lii s service experts segment  the principal components of cost of goods sold are equipment  parts and supplies and labor 
the principal raw materials used in lii s manufacturing processes are copper  aluminum and steel 
in instances where lii is unable to pass on to its customers increases in the costs of copper and aluminum  lii enters into forward contracts for the purchase of those materials 
lii attempts to minimize the risk of price fluctuations in key components by entering into contracts  typically at the beginning of the year  which generally provide for fixed prices for its needs throughout the year 
these hedging strategies enable lii to establish product prices for the entire model year while minimizing the impact of price increases of components and raw materials on its margins 
warranty expense is estimated based on historical trends and other factors 
on january   lii completed the acquisition of service experts inc  an hvac company comprised of hvac retail businesses across the united states  for approximately million  including million shares of lii common stock and the assumption of million of debt 
the acquisition added an additional service centers to the retail network 
as these centers have been integrated into the retail operation with the centers acquired by lii since september   operating performance has not reached expected levels 
subsequently  restructuring plans which covered selling  closing or merging under performing company owned dealer service centers have reduced the total number of company owned service centers to approximately as a result of these changes and other improvements  service experts financial results have improved significantly 
on january   lii adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 and recorded a million impairment of goodwill million  net of taxes 
the impairment charge relates primarily to the to acquisitions of lii s service experts and hearth products operations  where lower than expected operating results occurred 
in order to provide meaningful comparisons  certain financial information has been adjusted to reflect the discontinuation of goodwill and trademark amortization for the years ended december  and lii s fiscal year ends on december of each year and its interim fiscal quarters are each comprised of weeks 
for convenience  throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the week periods comprising each fiscal quarter are denoted by the last day of the calendar quarter

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates 
the critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how the company develops its judgments about future events and related estimations and how they can impact the financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that requires the most difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to the results of operations 
the company identified the most critical accounting policies to be estimation of warranty liabilities  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  adequacy of allowance for doubtful accounts  pension and post retirement benefit projections  and estimates of self insured risks 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page product warranties a liability for estimated warranty expense is established by a charge against operations at the time products are sold

the company recorded warranty expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s estimate of future warranty costs is determined for each product line 
the number of units that are expected to be repaired or replaced is determined by applying the estimated failure rate  which is generally based on historical experience  to the number of units that have been sold and are still under warranty 
the estimated units to be repaired under warranty are multiplied by the average cost undiscounted to repair or replace such products to determine the company s estimated future warranty cost 
the company s estimated future warranty cost is subject to adjustment from time to time depending on actual experience

the second step was required for certain reporting units within the residential heating and cooling  service experts and heat transfer reporting segments where the results of various business operations acquired during to were lower than expected 
in the second step  the company compared the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill  both of which were measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation was the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill and was less than the carrying amount of these reporting units goodwill by million 
accordingly  the company recorded a million million  net of tax impairment charge upon adoption 
the goodwill impairment evaluation described above requires management to make long range forecasts  determine the weighted average cost of capital and estimate the fair value of assets both recognized and unrecognized for the various reporting units 
these forecasts and related factors are subject to various risks and uncertainties described within this document 
to the extent these forecasts do not materialize and are adjusted downward in later periods  additional impairments may be required
