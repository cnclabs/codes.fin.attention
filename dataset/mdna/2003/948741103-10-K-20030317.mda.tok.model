item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
the results of operations and financial condition of the company  as reflected in the accompanying statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  retailer performance  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of the company s tenants 
management believes the most critical accounting policies in this regard are the estimation of an allowance for doubtful receivables including the allowance for straight line rent receivables  the determination of reserves for self insured general liability insurance and the periodic determination of whether the value of a real estate asset has been impaired 
each of these issues requires management to make judgments that are subjective in nature  however  management considers and assesses a significant amount of historical data and current market data in arriving at what it believes to be reasonable estimates

additionally  operating partnership units valued at million were issued in conjunction with the purchase of seven properties in north carolina which utilized the downreit structure 
including these north carolina properties  we acquired shopping centers  adding million square feet to our portfolio 
page in  wri acquired land at three separate locations for the development of retail shopping centers 
two of these acquisitions were made in joint ventures 
these joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting  because wri has the ability to exercise significant influence  but does not have financial or operating control 
we currently have retail developments underway which  upon completion  will represent an investment of approximately million and will add million square feet to the portfolio 
these projects will come on line beginning in early through mid we invested million in these projects during and expect to invest approximately million in these properties during and capitalized expenditures for acquisitions  new development and additions to the existing portfolio were  in millions   and during  and  respectively

million common shares of beneficial interest 
net proceeds to wri totaled million based on a price of per share and were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our million revolving credit facility 
wri has a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
this facility will mature in november and provides for a one year extension  at our sole option

wri also has an unsecured and uncommitted overnight credit facility totaling million to be used for cash management purposes 
wri has two interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million which expire in june and fix interest rates on a like amount of the million revolver at 
we have determined these swap agreements are highly effective in offsetting future variable interest cash flows of the revolving credit debt and  accordingly  they have been designated as cash flow hedges 
an additional interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of million serves as a hedge against changes in interest rates on a million variable rate medium term note 
this swap fixes the interest rate on the medium term note at and matures in july in july  an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million matured 
the fair value of these interest rate swaps at december  was reflected as a liability of million

page also in july  we entered into eleven interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million that convert fixed interest payments at rates from to to variable interest payments 
these interest rate swaps have been designated as fair value hedges 
we have determined that these contracts will be highly effective in limiting our risk of changes in the fair value of the fixed rate notes attributable to changes in variable interest rates 
the fair value of these interest rate swaps at december  was reflected as an asset of million 
during the first nine months of  the company issued a total of million of unsecured fixed rate medium term notes at a weighted average rate of and a weighted average term of years

funds from operations the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts defines funds from operations as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in addition  nareit recommends that extraordinary items not be considered in arriving at ffo 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with the nareit definition 
most industry analysts and equity reits  including wri  believe ffo is an alternative measure of performance relative to other reits 
there can be no assurance that ffo presented by wri is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness

   effects of inflation the rate of inflation was relatively unchanged in wri has structured its leases  however  in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby wri receives rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of wri s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which allows wri to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of wri s leases also require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and ad valorem taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon wri s operating results

accordingly  there is no assurance that wri s expectations will be realized 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk wri uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance its capital requirements 
these transactions expose wri to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage a portion of this risk  primarily interest rate swap agreements with major financial institutions 
these swap agreements expose wri to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties to the swaps 
we do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business 
at december   wri had fixed rate debt of billion and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps 
we also had variable rate notes receivable from joint venture partners totaling million at year end 
in the event interest rates were to increase basis points  net income  funds from operations and future cash flows would decrease million based upon the variable rate debt and notes receivable outstanding at december  page
