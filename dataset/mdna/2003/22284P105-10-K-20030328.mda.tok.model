overview we are one of the ten largest truckload carriers in the united states measured by revenue 
we focus on longer lengths of haul in targeted markets where we believe our service standards can provide a competitive advantage 
we are a major carrier for traditional truckload customers such as manufacturers and retailers  as well as for transportation companies such as freight forwarders  less than truckload carriers  and third party logistics providers that require a high level of service to support their businesses 
between and  we grew our revenue before fuel and other surcharges from million to million through internal growth and acquisitions 
over the same period  we grew net income from  or 
per diluted share  to million  or per diluted share 
we believe this rapid growth was strategically important  as we gained the size and equipment capacity to cover additional traffic lanes and geographic areas for customers  participate in competitive bids to transport freight for major shippers and develop a substantial dedicated service business 
beginning in  the combination of softening freight demand and our rapid expansion affected our profitability  as we were unable to obtain the freight rates and levels of asset utilization we expected 
at the same time  rising insurance premiums and depressed used truck prices increased our operating costs 
as a result  our freight revenue declined slightly and our net income declined to million in we experienced a net loss of million in  including a million pre tax impairment charge relating to the reduced market value of our used tractors 
following the setbacks in and early  we adopted several business practices in that were designed to improve our profitability and particularly  our average revenue per tractor  our chief measure of asset utilization 
the most significant of these practices were constraining the size of our tractor and trailer fleets until profit margins justify expansion  increasing freight volumes within our existing traffic lanes  replacing lower yielding freight  implementing selective rate increases  and reinforcing our cost control efforts 
we believe that a combination of these business practices and an improved freight environment contributed to substantial improvement in our operating performance between and for  our revenue declined from million to million  but our net income improved to million  including a million pre tax charge relating to the market value of our used tractors and a  after tax extraordinary item relating to early extinguishment of debt  both in the first quarter of revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  and other accessorial services 
freight revenue  which is our revenue before fuel and accessorial surcharges  has accounted for approximately of our revenue over the past three years 
generally  we are paid by the mile or by the load for our services 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the numbers of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the us economy  inventory levels  the level of truck capacity in our markets  specific customer demand  the percentage of team driven tractors in our fleet  and our average length of haul 
since we have held our fleet size relatively constant 
an overcapacity of trucks in our fleet and the industry generally as the economy slowed contributed to lower equipment utilization and pricing pressure 
revenue from an acquired operation that generated approximately million in revenue in the year prior to its acquisition helped offset the loss of revenue from certain existing customers whose freight volumes were affected by the economy or who sought lower priced service 
the main constraints on our internal growth are the ability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified drivers and  in times of slower economic growth  to add profitable freight 
in addition to constraining fleet size  we reduced our number of two person driver teams during and into to better match the demand for expedited long haul service 
our single driver fleets generally operate in shorter lengths of haul  generate fewer miles per tractor  and experience more non revenue miles  but the additional expenses and lower productive miles are expected to be offset by generally higher revenue per loaded mile and the reduced employee expense of compensating only one driver 
we expect operating statistics and expenses to shift with the mix of single and team operations 
expenses and profitability over the past three years the trucking industry has experienced a significant increase in operating costs 
the main factors for the industry as well as for us have been an increased annual cost of tractors due to higher initial prices and lower used truck values  a higher overall cost of insurance and claims  and elevated fuel prices 
other than those categories  our expenses have remained relatively constant or have declined 
looking forward  our profitability goal is to return to an operating ratio of approximately 
we expect this to require additional improvements in revenue per tractor per week to overcome expected additional cost increases of new revenue equipment discussed below  and other general increases in operating costs  as well as to expand our margins 
because a large percentage of our costs is variable  changes in revenue per mile affect our profitability to a greater extent than changes in miles per tractor 
revenue equipment we operate approximately  tractors and  trailers 
of our tractors  at december   approximately  were owned  were financed under operating leases  and were provided by owner operators  who own and drive the tractors 
of our trailers  at december   approximately  were owned and approximately  were financed under operating leases 
over the past several years  the market value of used equipment has deteriorated 
in recognition of this fact  we recognized pre tax impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of and million in the first quarter of in relation to the reduced value of our model year through tractors 
in addition  we increased the depreciation rate lease expense on our remaining tractors to reflect our expectations concerning market value at disposition 
we estimate the impact of the change in the estimated useful lives and depreciation on the model year tractors to be approximately million pre tax or 
per share annually 
although we believe the additional depreciation will bring the carrying values of the model year tractors in line with future disposition values  we do not have trade in agreements covering those tractors 
our assumptions represent our best estimate  and actual values could differ by the time those tractors are scheduled for trade 
because of the adverse change from historical purchase prices and residual values  the annual expense per tractor on model year and tractors is expected to be higher than the annual expense on the model year and units being replaced 
we believe the increase in depreciation expense was approximately one half cent per mile pre tax during and will grow to approximately one cent per mile pre tax in as all of these new units are delivered 
by the time the model year tractors are traded and the entire fleet is converted in  we expect the total increase in expense to be approximately one and one half cent pre tax per mile 
the timing of these expenses could be affected if we change our tractor trade cycle to three years  which we are considering 
if the tractors are leased instead of purchased  the references to increased depreciation would be reflected as additional lease expense 
we finance a portion of our tractor and trailer fleet with off balance sheet operating leases 
these leases generally run for a period of three years for tractors and seven years for trailers 
with our tractor trade cycle currently at approximately four years  we have been purchasing the leased tractors at the expiration of the lease term  although there is no commitment to purchase the tractors 
the first trailer leases expire in  and we have not determined whether to purchase trailers at the end of these leases 
owner operators provide a tractor and a driver and are responsible for all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile 
we do not have the capital outlay of purchasing the tractor 
the payments to owner operators and the financing of equipment under operating leases are recorded in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
expenses associated with owned equipment  such as interest and depreciation  are not incurred  and for owner operator tractors  driver compensation  fuel  and other expenses are not incurred 
because obtaining equipment from owner operators and under operating leases effectively shifts financing expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses  we evaluate our efficiency using net margin rather than operating ratio 
transplace effective july   we combined our logistics business with the logistics businesses of five other transportation companies into a company called transplace  inc transplace operates an internet based global transportation logistics service 
initially  we accounted for our investment in transplace using the equity method of accounting 
during the third quarter of  transplace changed its filing status to a c corporation and as a result  we determined it appropriate to account for our investment using the cost method of accounting 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to freight revenue  excluding fuel and accessorial surcharges for each of the three years ended december freight revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and related expenses fuel expense operations and maintenance revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims communications and utilities general supplies and expenses depreciation and amortization  including gains losses on disposition of equipment and impairment of assets total operating expenses operating income other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit income loss before extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt  net of income tax benefit net income loss freight revenue is total revenue less fuel surcharge and accessorial revenue 
in this table  fuel surcharge and accessorial revenue are shown netted against the appropriate expense category 
salaries  wages  and related expenses  million  million  and million  fuel expense  million  million  and million  operations and maintenance  million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
includes a million and a million pre tax impairment charge or and of freight revenue in and  respectively 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  freight revenue total revenue less fuel surcharge and accessorial revenue decreased million  to million in  from million in our revenue was affected by a decrease in weighted average number of tractors partially offset by a increase in revenue per tractor per week to  in from  in the revenue per tractor per week increase was primarily generated by a higher utilization of equipment and a higher rate per total mile 
weighted average tractors decreased to  in from  in we have elected to constrain the size of our tractor fleet until fleet production and profitability improve 
salaries  wages  and related expenses  net of accessorial revenue of million in and million in  decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  salaries  wages  and related expenses decreased to in  from in wages for over the road drivers as a percentage of freight revenue decreased to in from in the decrease was largely attributable to us utilizing a larger percentage of single driver tractors  with only one driver per tractor to be compensated  implementing changes in our pay structure and implementing a per diem pay program for our drivers during august as a percentage of freight revenue  our payroll expense for employees other than over the road drivers increased to in from in due to growth in headcount and local drivers in the dedicated fleet 
health insurance  employer paid taxes  workers compensation  and other employee benefits decreased to in from in the decrease was primarily due to lower employer paid taxes related to lower wage levels and was partially offset by increases in workers compensation and health insurance costs related to rising medical expenses  which are expected to continue to increase in future periods 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million in and million in  decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  net fuel expense remained relatively constant at in and in fuel surcharges amounted to 
per loaded mile in compared to 
per loaded mile in fuel prices have increased sharply during the first two months of because of reasons such as unrest in venezuela and the middle east and low inventories 
higher fuel prices will increase our operating expenses 
fuel costs may be affected in the future by volume purchase commitments  the collectibility of fuel surcharges  and lower fuel mileage due to government mandated emissions standards that were effective october   and will result in less fuel efficient engines 
we did not have any fuel hedging contracts at december  operations and maintenance consist primarily of vehicle maintenance  repairs and driver recruitment expenses 
net of accessorial revenue of million in and million in  operations and maintenance decreased million to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  operations and maintenance remained essentially constant at in and we extended the trade cycle on our tractor fleet from three years to four years  which resulted in an increase in the number of required repairs 
however  the increased repair costs were offset by reduced driver recruitment expenses 
we expect maintenance costs to decrease as we take delivery of new tractors 
driver recruiting expense may increase if shipping volumes increase and create greater demand for trucking services 
revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased to in from in the decrease was the result of lower lease payments of freight revenue in compared to of freight revenue in and a smaller fleet of owner operators during an average of in compared to an average of in 
the smaller fleet of owner operators resulted in lower payments to owner operators of freight revenue in compared to of freight revenue in 
we expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership and or leasing to increase in future periods 
the increase is expected to result from a combination of higher initial prices of new equipment  lower resale values for used equipment  and increased depreciation lease payments on some of our existing equipment over their remaining lives in order to better match expected book values or lease residual values with market values at the equipment disposal date 
to the extent equipment is leased under operating leases  the amounts will be reflected in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
to the extent equipment is owned or obtained under capitalized leases  the amounts will be reflected as depreciation expense and interest expense 
those expense items will fluctuate with changes in the percentage of our equipment obtained under operating leases versus owned and under capitalized leases 
operating taxes and licenses decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  operating taxes and licenses remained essentially constant at in and insurance and claims  consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability  physical damage  and cargo damage insurance and claims  increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  insurance increased to in from in the increase is a result of an industry wide increase in insurance rates  which we addressed by adopting an insurance program with significantly higher self insured retention exposure that is partially offset by lower premium rates 
the retention level for our primary insurance layer increased from  in to  in to  in march of  to million in november of  and to million on march  from july  to november   our excess insurance coverage over the million primary layer we had in effect million from november to november  was determined to be invalid 
although we are not aware of any claim that is expected to exceed our primary coverage  any such claim would be uninsured unless the agent s errors and omissions policy provides coverage 
in the event of an uninsured claim our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we accrue the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
these accruals are based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of the claim and estimates of future claims development based on historical trends 
insurance and claims expense will vary based on the frequency and severity of claims  the premium expense  and the level of self insured retention 
because of higher self insured retentions  our future expenses of insurance and claims may be higher or more volatile than in historical periods 
communications and utilities decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  communications and utilities remained essentially constant at in and general supplies and expenses  consisting primarily of headquarters and other terminal facilities expenses  increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  general supplies and expenses remained essentially constant at in and in depreciation  amortization and impairment charge  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  decreased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to in from in the decrease is the result of impairment charges  partially offset by increased depreciation expense and losses on the sale of equipment 
we recognized pre tax charges of approximately million and million  in and  respectively  to reflect an impairment in tractor values 
depreciation and amortization expense is net of any gain or loss on the sale of tractors and trailers 
loss on the sale of tractors and trailers was approximately million in and  in we expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership and or leasing to increase in future periods 
the increase is expected to result from a combination of higher initial prices of new equipment  lower resale values for used equipment  and increased depreciation lease payments on some of our existing equipment over their remaining lives in order to better match expected book values or lease residual values with market values at the equipment disposal date 
to the extent equipment is leased under operating leases  the amounts will be reflected in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
to the extent equipment is owned or obtained under capitalized leases  the amounts will be reflected as depreciation expense and interest expense 
those expense items will fluctuate with changes in the percentage of our equipment obtained under operating leases versus owned and under capitalized leases 
amortization expense relates to deferred debt costs incurred and covenants not to compete from five acquisitions 
goodwill amortization ceased beginning january   in accordance with sfas no 
 and we evaluate goodwill and certain intangibles for impairment  annually 
during the second quarter of  we tested our goodwill for impairment and found no impairment 
the positive impact of goodwill no longer being amortized was approximately  for other expense  net  decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of freight revenue  other expense decreased to in from in the decrease was the result of lower debt balances and more favorable interest rates 
included in the other expense category are interest expense  interest income  and pre tax non cash losses related to the accounting for interest rate derivatives under sfas no 
 which amounted to million in and million in our income tax expense in was million or of income before taxes 
our income tax benefit for was million or of loss before income taxes 
the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate due to permanent differences related to a per diem pay structure implemented during the third quarter of due to the nondeductible effect of per diem  our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods as income fluctuates 
as a result of the factors described above  net earnings increased million  to million income in of revenue  from million loss in of revenue 
prior to the million and million pre tax charges for impairment  net income for and would have been million diluted earnings per share and million diluted earnings per share respectively 
as a result of the foregoing  our net margin increased to in from in comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue decreased million  to million in  from million in our growth was affected by a decrease in revenue per tractor per week to  in from  in the revenue per tractor per week decrease was primarily generated by a lower utilization of equipment and a lower rate per total mile due to a less robust freight environment 
weighted average tractors increased to  in from  in due to a weak freight environment  we have elected to constrain the size of our tractor fleet until profitability improves 
salaries  wages  and related expenses decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  salaries  wages  and related expenses increased to in  from in even though the percentage of total miles driven by company trucks increased in vs 
in  wages for over the road drivers as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in  partially due to our implementation of cost reduction strategies including a per diem pay program for our drivers during august our payroll expense for employees other than over the road drivers increased to of revenue in from of revenue in due to growth in headcount and local drivers in the dedicated fleet 
health insurance  employer paid taxes  and workers compensation increased to of revenue in  from in the increase as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of increased group health insurance claims in as compared to fuel expense increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel expense increased to in from in this increase was due to the increased usage of company trucks due to the decrease in our utilization of owner operators  who pay for their own fuel purchases  lower quantities and less efficient pricing of fuel contracted using purchase commitments  and slightly lower fuel economy 
these increases were partially offset by fuel surcharges  which amounted to 
per loaded mile or approximately million in compared to 
per loaded mile or approximately million in fuel costs may be affected in the future by lower fuel mileage if government mandated emissions standards effective october   are implemented as scheduled 
operations and maintenance  consisting primarily of vehicle maintenance  repairs and driver recruitment expenses  increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  operations and maintenance increased to in  from in we extended the trade cycle on our tractor fleet from three years to four years  which resulted in an increase in the number of required repairs 
revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation decreased to in from in the decrease was primarily the result of a smaller fleet of owner operators during an average of in compared to an average of in 
over the past year  it has become more difficult to retain owner operators due to the challenging operating conditions 
the smaller fleet resulted in lower payments to owner operators of revenue in compared to of revenue in 
owner operators are independent contractors  who provide a tractor and driver and cover all of their operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile 
accordingly  expenses such as driver salaries  fuel  repairs  depreciation  and interest normally associated with company owned equipment are consolidated in revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation when owner operators are utilized 
the decrease from lower owner operator expense was partially offset by our entry into additional operating leases 
as of december   we had financed approximately tractors and  trailers under operating leases as compared to  tractors and  trailers under operating leases as of december  the equipment leases will increase this expense category in the future  while reducing depreciation and interest expense 
operating taxes and licenses decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  operating taxes and licenses remained essentially constant at in as compared to in insurance and claims  consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability  physical damage  and cargo damage insurance and claims  increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance increased to in from in the increase is a result of an industry wide increase in insurance rates  which we addressed by adopting an insurance program with significantly higher deductible exposure that is partially offset by lower premium rates 
the deductible amount increased from  in to  in in  we increased our deductible to  our insurance program for liability  physical damage  and cargo damage involves self insurance with varying risk retention levels 
claims in excess of these risk retention levels are covered by insurance in amounts which we consider adequate 
we accrue the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
these accruals are based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of the claim and estimates of future claims development based on historical trends 
insurance and claims expense will vary based on the frequency and severity of claims  the premium expense and the lack of self insured retention 
communications and utilities increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities remained essentially constant at in as compared to in general supplies and expenses  consisting primarily of headquarters and other terminal facilities expenses  increased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  general supplies and expenses remained essentially constant at in and in depreciation and amortization  including gains losses on disposition of equipment and impairment of assets  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization increased to in from in the increase is primarily the result of a million pre tax impairment charge related to approximately  model year through tractors in use 
we will recognize an additional impairment charge on tractors in the first quarter of see critical accounting policies impairment of long lived assets for additional information 
our approximately  model year tractors are not affected by the charge 
we have increased the annual depreciation expense on the model year tractors to approximate our recent experience with disposition values 
depreciation and amortization expense is net of any gain or loss on the sale of tractors and trailers 
loss on the sale of tractors and trailers was approximately  in compared to a gain of million in period 
amortization expense relates to deferred debt costs incurred and covenants not to compete from five acquisitions  as well as goodwill from eight acquisitions 
goodwill amortization will cease beginning january   in accordance with sfas and we will evaluate goodwill and certain intangibles for impairment  annually prospectively beginning january other expense  net  decreased million  to million in  from million in as a percentage of revenue  other expense remained essentially constant at in the period from in the period 
included in the other expense category is interest expense  interest income  and a million pre tax non cash adjustment related to the accounting for interest rate derivatives under sfas excluding the non cash adjustment  other expense decreased million  to million in the period from million in the period 
the decrease was the result of lower debt balances and interest rates 
as a result of the foregoing  our pre tax margin decreased to in compared with in our income tax benefit for was million or of loss before income taxes 
our income tax expense for was million or of earnings before income taxes 
in  the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate due to permanent differences related to a per diem pay structure implemented during the third quarter of due to the nondeductible effect of per diem  our tax rate will fluctuate in future periods as earnings fluctuate 
as a result of the factors described above  net earnings decreased million  to million loss in of revenue  from million income in of revenue 
prior to the million pre tax charge for impairment  net income and earnings per share for would have been million and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources historically our growth has required significant capital investments 
we historically have financed our expansion requirements with borrowings under a line of credit  cash flows from operations and long term operating leases 
our primary sources of liquidity at december   were funds provided by operations  proceeds under the securitization facility as defined below  proceeds under the credit agreement as defined below and operating leases of revenue equipment 
we believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and projected needs for at least the next twelve months 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in our primary sources of cash flow from operations in were net income and depreciation and amortization  which included a million pre tax impairment charge 
the period included an unusually large collection of receivables that had resulted from billing problems during and a large increase in depreciation and amortization  associated with the million pre tax impairment charge 
our number of days sales in accounts receivable increased to days in from days in net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in in  net cash used in investing activities related to the purchase of tractors  which were previously financed through operating leases  and the acquisition of new revenue equipment net of trade ins using proceeds from the credit agreement 
during and  capital expenditures were lower than in previous years due to our planned slower fleet growth as well as our decision to lengthen our tractor trade cycle 
in  approximately million was related to the financing of our headquarters facility  which was previously financed through an operating lease that expired in march we financed the facility using proceeds from the credit agreement 
during  approximately million related to a million investment in transplace and million for the acquisition of certain assets of cts 
we expect capital expenditures  primarily for revenue equipment net of trade ins  to be approximately million in  exclusive of acquisitions  if we remain on a four year trade cycle for tractors 
if we change our trade cycle back to three years  our capital expenditures could increase significantly 
we also are considering alternatives for accelerating our trailer disposition schedule  which could affect our capital expenditures or lease commitments 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  million in and million in during  we reduced outstanding balance sheet debt by million 
at december   we had outstanding debt of million  primarily consisting of million drawn under the credit agreement  million in the securitization facility  and a million interest bearing note to the former primary stockholder of srt 
interest rates on this debt range from to 
in  we authorized a stock repurchase plan for up to million shares to be purchased in the open market or through negotiated transactions 
in  a total of  shares had been purchased with an average price of 
during and  we did not purchase any additional shares through the repurchase plan 
the stock repurchase program has no expiration date 
in december  we entered into the credit agreement with a group of banks  which matures december and was extended in february for an additional two years 
borrowings under the credit agreement are based on the banks base rate or libor and accrue interest based on one  two  or three month libor rates plus an applicable margin that is adjusted quarterly between and based on cash flow coverage 
at december   the margin was 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by the company and all of the company s subsidiaries except cvti receivables corp 
and volunteer insurance limited 
at december   the credit agreement had a maximum borrowing limit of million 
when the facility was extended in february  the borrowing limit was reduced to million with an accordion feature which permits an increase up to a borrowing limit of million 
borrowings related to revenue equipment are limited to the lesser of of net book value of revenue equipment or the maximum borrowing limit 
letters of credit were limited to an aggregate commitment of million at december   and were increased to a limit of million in february the credit agreement includes a security agreement such that the credit agreement may be collateralized by virtually all of our assets if a covenant violation occurs 
a commitment fee  that is adjusted quarterly between and per annum based on cash flow coverage  is due on the daily unused portion of the credit agreement 
as of december   we had borrowings under the credit agreement in the amount of million with a weighted average interest rate of 
in december  we entered into a million revolving accounts receivable securitization facility the securitization facility 
on a revolving basis  we sell our interests in our accounts receivable to crc  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary incorporated in nevada 
crc sells a percentage ownership in such receivables to an unrelated financial entity 
we can receive up to million of proceeds  subject to eligible receivables and will pay a service fee recorded as interest expense  based on commercial paper interest rates plus an applicable margin of per annum and a commitment fee of per annum on the daily unused portion of the facility 
as discussed in the financial statement footnotes  the net proceeds under the securitization facility are required to be shown as a current liability because the term  subject to annual renewals  is days 
as of december  there were million in proceeds received 
crc does not meet the requirements for off balance sheet accounting  therefore  it is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
in october  we issued million in ten year senior notes to an insurance company 
the notes were retired on march   with borrowings from the credit agreement 
we incurred a million after tax extraordinary item million pre tax to reflect the early extinguishment of this debt in the first quarter of the credit agreement and securitization facility contain certain restrictions and covenants relating to  among other things  dividends  tangible net worth  cash flow  acquisitions and dispositions  and total indebtedness and are cross defaulted 
we are in compliance with the credit agreement and securitization facility as of december  contractual obligations and commitments we had commitments outstanding related to equipment  debt obligations  and diesel fuel purchases as of december  these purchases are expected to be financed by debt  proceeds from sales of existing equipment  and cash flows from operations 
we have the option to cancel commitments relating to equipment with days notice 
the following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period there in thousands total after long term debt   short term debt   operating leases        lease residual value guarantees       purchase obligations diesel fuel    equipment   total contractual cash obligations        critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors it considers as relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures 
changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note of the financial statements attached hereto 
other footnotes describe various elements of the financial statements and the assumptions on which specific amounts were determined 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition revenue  drivers wages and other direct operating expenses are recognized on the date shipments are delivered to the customer 
we record revenue on a net basis for transactions on which we functioned as a broker in and prior to january   we reported revenue net of fuel surcharges and accessorial revenue and netted such amounts against the related expense items 
effective january   we began including those items in revenue in our statement of operations  and the prior period statements of operations have been conformed with the reclassification 
property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
historically  we depreciated revenue equipment over five to seven years with salvage values ranging from to 
during  we extended our estimate for the useful life of our dry van trailers acquired between july and march from seven to eight years and increased the salvage value to approximately of cost 
we based this decision on market experience at that time 
we are re evaluating the salvage value  useful life  and annual depreciation of these trailers based on the current market environment 
any change could result in greater annual expense in the future 
in september  we changed our estimated useful life and salvage value to seven years and of cost for new trailers 
gains or losses on disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation in the statements of income 
impairment of long lived assets in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supersedes both sfas and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions in sfas for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas for example  sfas provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
we adopted sfas on january  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets by analyzing the operating performance and future cash flows for those assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
we adjust the carrying value of the underlying assets if the sum of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying value 
impairment can be impacted by our projection of future cash flows  the level of cash flows and salvage values  the methods of estimatation used for determining fair values and the impact of guaranteed residuals 
insurance and other claims our insurance program for liability  property damage  and cargo loss and damage  involves self insurance with high risk retention levels 
we have increased the self insured retention portion of our insurance coverage from  for each claim in to million plus an additional layer from million to million for each claim at november effective march  we increased our primary coverage to million with a million retention level  plus an additional layer from million to million for each claim 
we accrue the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
these accruals are based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of the claim and estimates of future claims development based on historical trends 
the rapid and substantial increase in our self insured retention makes these estimates an important accounting judgment 
insurance and claims expense will vary based on the frequency and severity of claims  the premium expense and the lack of self insured retention 
in addition to our primary insurance coverage we normally carry excess coverage in amounts that have ranged from million to million 
on july   we received a binder for million of excess insurance coverage over our million primary layer 
subsequently  we were forced to seek replacement coverage after the insurance agent retained the premium and failed to produce proof of insurance coverage 
if one or more claims from the period july to november exceeded million in amount  we would be required to accrue for the potential or actual loss and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are not aware of any such claims at this time 
we maintain a workers compensation plan and group medical plan for our employees with a deductible amount of  for each workers compensation claim and a deductible amount of  for each group medical claim 
in the first quarter of  we adopted a workers compensation plan with a self insured retention level of million per occurrence and renewed our group medical plan with a deductible amount of  lease accounting we lease a significant portion of our tractor and trailer fleet using operating leases 
substantially all of the leases have residual value guarantees under which we must insure that the lessor receives a negotiated amount for the equipment at the expiration of the lease 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  the rental expense under these leases is reflected as an operating expense under revenue equipment rentals and purchased transportation 
to the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee  we accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term 
the estimated values at lease termination involve management judgments 
operating leases are carried off balance sheet in accordance with sfas no 
inflation and fuel costs most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
we historically have limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
fuel expense comprises a larger percentage of revenue for us than many other carriers because of our long average length of haul 
most of our contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although we historically have been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  increases usually are not fully recovered 
fuel prices have remained high throughout most of   and  which has increased our cost of operating 
the elevated level of fuel prices has continued into seasonality in the trucking industry  revenue generally decreases as customers reduce shipments during the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations 
at the same time  operating expenses generally increase  with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and weather creating more equipment repairs 
for the reasons stated  first quarter net income historically has been lower than net income in each of the other three quarters of the year 
our equipment utilization typically improves substantially between may and october of each year because of the trucking industry s seasonal shortage of equipment on traffic originating in california and our ability to satisfy some of that requirement 
the seasonal shortage typically occurs between may and august because california produce carriers equipment is fully utilized for produce during those months and does not compete for shipments hauled by our dry van operation 
during september and october  business increases as a result of increased retail merchandise shipped in anticipation of the holidays 
the table below sets forth quarterly information reflecting our equipment utilization miles per tractor per period during   and we believe that equipment utilization more accurately demonstrates the seasonality of our business than changes in revenue  which are affected by the timing of deliveries of new revenue equipment 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends 
equipment utilization table miles per tractor per period first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter factors that may affect future results a number of factors  over which we have little or no control  may affect our future results 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following economic factors negative economic factors such as recessions  downturns in customers business cycles  surplus inventories  inflation  and higher interest rates could impair our operating results by decreasing equipment utilization or increasing costs of operations 
fuel prices the price of diesel fuel has remained at elevated levels for much of the past three years 
fuel is one of our largest operating expenses  and high fuel prices have a negative impact on our profitability 
significant fluctuations can make collection of fuel surcharges more difficult 
continued high fuel prices and fluctuations may affect our future results 
in addition  our volume purchase commitments during and obligate us to purchase approximately million and million gallons in and  respectively 
rising prices of fuel will negatively impact our profitability to the extent of purchase commitments  less the effects of fixed price arrangements and financial hedges 
capital requirements the truckload industry is very capital intensive 
historically  we have depended on cash from operations and our credit facility to expand the size of our fleet and maintain modern revenue equipment 
we review our tractor and trailer trade cycle from time to time 
in  we extended our trade cycle for tractors from three years to four years because of a depressed market for used equipment 
we are considering returning to a tractor trade cycle of less than four years if the expected overall costs of maintenance and capital would benefit the company 
such a change  or other changes in tractor and trailer acquisition and financing  could materially increase our borrowing 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms in the future  we may have to limit our growth  enter into less favorable financing arrangements  or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods  any of which could have a materially adverse affect on our profitability 
growth we experienced significant growth in revenue between our founding in and since  however  our revenue base has remained relatively constant 
there can be no assurance that our revenue growth rate will return to historical levels or that we can effectively adapt our management  administrative  and operational systems to respond to any future growth 
our operating margins could be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic conditions 
slower or less profitable growth could adversely affect our stock price 
resale of used revenue equipment prior to  we historically recognized gains on the sale of our revenue equipment 
the market for used tractors experienced a sharp drop in late and low resale values have continued into which led to the impairment charges described herein 
the prices of used trailers also are depressed 
if the prices for used equipment remain depressed  we could find it necessary to dispose of our equipment at lower prices  increase our depreciation expense  and or retain some of our equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers competition for drivers is intense in the trucking industry 
there historically has been  and continues to be  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers 
this shortage could force us to significantly increase the compensation we pay to driver employees  curtail our growth  or experience the adverse effects of tractors without drivers 
competition the trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with other truckload carriers  private fleets operated by existing and potential customers  railroads  rail intermodal service  and to some extent with air freight service 
competition is based primarily on service  efficiency  and freight rates 
many competitors offer transportation service at lower rates than the company 
our results could suffer if we are forced to compete solely on the basis of rates or if economic and competitive factors increase the downward pressure on rates 
regulation the trucking industry is subject to various governmental regulations 
the dot sent a final rule  which has not been published  to the office of management and budget omb in january  for omb review and approval 
that rule  if approved  may limit the hours in service during which a driver may operate a tractor 
the dot is also considering a proposal that would require installing certain safety equipment on tractors 
the epa has promulgated air emission standards that have increased the cost of tractor engines and are expected to reduce fuel mileage 
although we are unable to predict the nature of any changes in regulations  the cost of any changes  if implemented  may adversely affect our profitability 
insurance and claims from to present  we have adopted an insurance program with significantly higher deductibles 
an increase in the number or severity of accidents  stolen equipment  or other loss events over those anticipated could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability 
acquisitions a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions  and acquisitions are an important component of our growth strategy 
we must continue to identify desirable target companies and negotiate  finance  and close acceptable transactions or our growth could suffer 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas provides new guidance on the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost 
it also provides accounting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year beginning in and is not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of and also broadens the definition of what constitutes discontinued operations and how the results of discontinued operations are to be measured and presented 
sfas was effective for our fiscal year beginning in and is not expected to materially change the methods we use to measure impairment losses on long lived assets 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas amends existing guidance on reporting gains and losses on extinguishment of debt to prohibit the classification of the gain or loss as extraordinary  as the use of such extinguishments have become part of the risk management strategy of many companies 
sfas also amends sfas to require sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
the provisions of the statement related to the rescission of statement no 
is applied in fiscal years beginning after may  the provisions of the statement related to statement no 
were effective for transactions occurring after may  the adoption of sfas no 
is expected to result in reclassification of the fiscal year loss on extinguishment of debt 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
interpretation no 
also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have guarantees which are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements 
we do not anticipate adopting the fair value method of accounting promulgated by sfas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to market risks from changes in i certain commodity prices and ii certain interest rates on our debt 
commodity price risk prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political  economic  and market factors that are generally outside our control 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  we have been able to recover a portion of long term fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can be unpredictable as well as the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
for  diesel fuel expenses net of fuel surcharge represented of our total operating expenses and of freight revenue 
at december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
we do not trade in derivatives with the objective of earning financial gains on price fluctuations  on a speculative basis  nor do we trade in these instruments when there are no underlying related exposures 
interest rate risk the credit agreement  provided there has been no default  carries a maximum variable interest rate of libor for the corresponding period plus 
during the first quarter of  we entered into two million notional amount interest rate swap agreements to manage the risk of variability in cash flows associated with floating rate debt 
at december   we had drawn million under the credit agreement 
approximately million was subject to variable rates and the remaining million was subject to interest rate swaps that fixed the interest rates at and plus the applicable margin per annum 
the swaps expire january and march these derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
and consequently are marked to fair value through earnings  in other expense in the accompanying statement of operations 
at december   the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements was a liability of million 
assuming the december  variable rate borrowings  each one percentage point increase or decrease in libor would affect our pre tax interest expense by  on an annualized basis  excluding the portion of variable rate debt covered by cancelable interest rate swaps  and the effect of changes in fair values resulting from those swaps 
we do not trade in derivatives with the objective of earning financial gains on price fluctuations  on a speculative basis  nor do we trade in these instruments when there are no underlying related exposures
