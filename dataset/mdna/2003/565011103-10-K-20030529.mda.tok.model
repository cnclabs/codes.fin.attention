as a result of deterioration in the markets for our products and services due to the progressive weakening of global economic conditions beginning in fiscal and continuing in fiscal  we have new challenges in our ability to stabilize revenue and operating performance and to expand market share 
the weak macroeconomic environment over the past two years has included a recession in the united states economy that was fueled by substantial reductions in capital spending by corporations world wide  especially spending on information technology 
during our second and third quarters of fiscal  we first experienced delays in consummating software license transactions 
while the global economy declined during much of fiscal  there were indications late in the year that an end to the economic slow down appeared to be forthcoming 
late in our fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced improvements in closure rates on software license transactions  as evidenced by an increase in software revenue as compared to our second and third quarters of fiscal as we entered into fiscal  global economic conditions and information technology spending appeared to be stabilizing 
however  capital spending by corporations  especially spending on enterprise application software  continued to be weak 
we also believe market conditions overseas  especially in europe  tend to lag market conditions in the united states 
we believe that the primary reasons for the decrease in information technology spending in fiscal and related to concerns of our clients and prospects about committing to large capital projects in the face of uncertain global economic conditions and the impact of these conditions on their respective businesses 
as a result  organizations intensified their efforts to identify and realize potential cost savings  in part  by restricting their software procurement to well defined current needs 
in addition  in the years preceding the global economic slowdown  many corporations made capital expenditures in anticipation of future growth that did not materialize  thereby reducing their capital expenditure needs in our fiscal and fiscal years 
geopolitical concerns and uncertainties  such as the war on terrorism  the events leading up to  and the subsequent war with iraq and other hostilities in various parts of the world appear to have exacerbated corporations caution regarding their capital spending 
our financial performance was adversely affected in fiscal as a result of these economic conditions and uncertainties and the resulting decrease in enterprise application software spending by united states and european corporations 
the lengthening of sales cycles and reductions in capital spending in recent quarters caused our software revenue and total revenue to decrease in fiscal  adversely affecting our operating performance 
demand for our pricing and revenue optimization and our supplier relationship management products has been more severely impacted than our supply chain management and service parts management products for which there are more mature markets 
although our markets in most industries and geographies have deteriorated  industries most severely impacted include  among others  manufacturing  chemical energy  high technology and travel  transportation hospitality 
industries less affected include government  aerospace defense and automotive  consumer packaged goods  food beverage  life sciences and retail  as consumer spending  especially in the united states  has remained relatively stable 
our clients and prospects in these markets have continued to invest in application software  including our offerings  although at reduced levels 
customers are generally licensing fewer software modules than in past years 
we have not lost any major customers or contracts in recent quarters that have negatively impacted revenue 
as a result of these factors  we experienced a decline in the average selling price asp per significant software license transaction and a decline in the number of software license transactions of million and greater in fiscal as compared to fiscal currently  it is unclear when or if our average selling price per license transaction will decrease  stabilize or increase 
we expect market conditions will continue to be challenging for us in the near term as longer sales cycles and delays in decision making on software purchases may persist 
in response to the weakness in spending on enterprise application software  we enacted a number of cost containment and cost reduction measures during fiscal  in addition to those implemented during fiscal  to reduce our cost structure 
during fiscal  we reduced our employee workforce from  employees at may  to  employees at february  or across the organization 
in addition  we reduced the number of contractors  implemented a mandatory unpaid leave program for all us employees during the first week in july and september and a voluntary week of unpaid leave during our second and third quarters of fiscal for our european employees and reduced our office space 
these cost containment and cost reduction measures resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of approximately million during fiscal for severance and related benefits associated with involuntary terminations  lease termination costs  contract termination costs  relocation costs and impairment charges on our sales force automation software  property  equipment and leasehold improvements 
in addition  we expect to incur incremental restructuring charges of approximately million in our first quarter of fiscal as a result of further cost containment and cost reduction initiatives including subleasing approximately of our corporate headquarters space for an amount less than our current rent obligation 
we expect to sublease the space by august  with expected annual cost savings of approximately million 
our implementation of cost containment and cost reduction initiatives during our second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal better aligned our operating cost structure with the anticipated revenue levels due to the downturn in the global economy 
our cost containment and cost reduction initiatives reduced our aggregate cost of software  cost of services and support  sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses  excluding amortization of acquired technology and non cash compensation expense 
for our fourth quarter of fiscal  these expenses decreased  or million  from the total for our first quarter of fiscal  compared to a decrease in total revenues of  or million  over the same period 
since the end of our fourth quarter  we have further reduced our total workforce and expect our employee workforce to total between  and  employees for our first and second quarters in fiscal in the aggregate  we expect that all cost containment and cost reduction measures implemented in fiscal will reduce our cost structure by approximately million on an annualized basis 
in addition  during fiscal we continued to shift a significant number of contractors to our product development facilities in india 
at february    or  of our total product development contractors were based in india as compared to  or  at february  results of operations the following table includes the consolidated statements of operations data for each of the years in the three year period ended february  expressed as a percentage of revenue fiscal year ended february  revenue software services support reimbursed expenses total revenue operating expenses cost of software amortization of acquired technology cost of services and support cost of reimbursed expenses sales and marketing product development general and administrative amortization of intangibles goodwill impairment charge purchased research and development and acquisition related expenses restructuring and other impairment charges non cash stock compensation expense benefit iri settlement total operating expenses loss from operations other expense income net loss before income taxes provision for benefit from from income taxes net loss the percentages shown above for cost of services and support  sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses have been calculated excluding non cash stock compensation expense benefit as follows in thousands fiscal year ended february  cost of services and support sales and marketing product development general and administrative see operating expenses non cash stock compensation expense benefit for further detail 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates made by management with respect to these and other items that require management s estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and impairment review of goodwill  deferred income taxes and restructuring related expenses 
these policies  and our procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue our revenue consists of software license revenue  services revenue  support revenue and reimbursed expenses 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
software license revenue  services revenue and support revenue are generally recognized when the four basic criteria of sop and sab are met as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by us and the customer to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered delivery is considered to occur when media containing the licensed program is provided to a common carrier fob shipping point or  in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
fixed or determinable fee we consider the license fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and is payable within months from the agreement date 
if the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
we consider services fees to be fixed or determinable if the services fee or rates for time and material contracts are not subject to refund or adjustment 
collection is probable we perform a credit review for all significant transactions at the time the arrangement is executed to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as they become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer the revenue and recognize the revenue upon collection 
if a software license contains customer acceptance criteria or a cancellation right  the software revenue is deferred and recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation right 
fees are allocated to the various elements of software license agreements using the residual method  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vsoe of fair value for support services is provided by the renewal rate 
vsoe of fair value for implementation services is based upon separate sales of services at stated hourly rates by level of consultant 
under the residual method  we defer revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements based on vsoe of fair value  and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and recognized as revenue when the basic criteria in sop and sab have been met 
typically  payments for software licenses are due within twelve months from the agreement date 
where software license agreements call for payment terms of twelve months or more from the agreement date  software revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
when we provide services that are considered essential to the functionality of software products licensed or if the licensed software requires significant production  modification or customization  we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in these cases  software revenue is deferred and recognized based on labor hours incurred to date compared to total estimated labor hours for the contract 
implementation services are separately priced and sold  are generally available from a number of suppliers and typically are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
implementation services  which include project management  systems planning  design and implementation  customer configurations and training are typically billed on an hourly basis time and materials and sometimes under fixed price contracts 
implementation services are recognized as the work is performed 
on fixed price contracts  services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating labor hours incurred to date to total estimated labor hours 
in the event services are billed in advance of work being performed  the billed amount is initially recorded as deferred services revenue and recognized as services revenue when the work is performed 
to date  the number of fixed price services engagements and services engagements considered essential to the functionality of our software products both situations requiring use of the percentage of completion method have been insignificant 
however  if we enter into more of these types of arrangements in the future  our reported revenue and operating performance will be subject to increased levels of estimates and uncertainties 
the estimation process inherent in the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting for revenue is subject to judgments and uncertainties and may affect the amounts of software and services revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates to complete client engagements including skill level and experience of project managers and staff assigned to engagements and continuity and attrition level of implementation consulting staff 
changes in the estimated stage of completion of a particular project could create variability in our revenue and results of operations if we are required to increase or decrease previously recognized revenue related to a particular project or we expect to incur a loss on the project 
support revenue includes post contract customer support and the rights to unspecified software upgrades and enhancements 
customer support is generally billed annually  initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as support revenue ratably over the support period 
allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three years in the period ended february   our provision for doubtful accounts has ranged between approximately and of total revenue 
we initially record the provision for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience of write offs and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and related credit risks 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers the age of the accounts receivable  our historical write off experience  the credit worthiness of the customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry and general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of the company s future provision for doubtful accounts 
if the assumptions we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future collections  there could be an impact on future reported results of operations 
based on our total revenue reported for the fiscal  our provision for doubtful accounts would change by approximately million annually for a change in proportion of total revenue 
the provision for doubtful accounts is included in sales and marketing expense for software license receivables and cost of services and support for services and support fees receivable  in the condensed consolidated statement of operations 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize the development cost of software  other than internal use software  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to clients 
software development costs are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product  commencing with the date the product is first available for general release 
generally  an economic life of two years is used to amortize capitalized software development costs 
in future periods  if we determine that technological feasibility occurs at a later date  such as coincident with general product release to clients  we may not capitalize any software development costs 
this would increase our reported operating expenses in the short term by the amounts we do not capitalize  which have ranged between million and million annually during fiscal through fiscal the estimated economic life of our capitalized software development costs is subject to change in future periods based on our experience with the length of time our products or enhancements are being or are expected to be used 
a change in the expected economic life of our capitalized software development costs of six months would change our annual operating expenses by approximately million to million 
valuation of long lived assets  including intangible assets and impairment review of goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including intangible assets and software developed for internal use  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
when we determine that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  we generally measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in addition  at each reporting date  we compare the net realizable value of capitalized software development costs to the unamortized capitalized costs 
to the extent the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the net realizable value  the excess amount is written off 
other intangible assets  including acquired technology  are amortized over periods ranging from two to seven years 
evaluating long lived assets for impairment involves judgments as to when an asset may potentially be impaired 
we consider there to be a risk of impairment if there is a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  if there is a significant change in the extent or intended use of an asset  or if actual or projected operating losses indicate continuing losses from an asset used to produce revenue 
as of february  our net book value of long lived assets  consisted of the following in thousands property and equipment software development costs software developed for internal use goodwill acquired technology customer relationships total the estimated economic useful lives of our long lived and intangible assets are subject to change in future periods based upon the intended use of the asset or period of time revenues are expected to be generated 
on march   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas goodwill and other intangible assets and as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill 
we performed the initial impairment review of our goodwill required by sfas during the first quarter of fiscal and no impairment losses were recognized 
during the quarters ended august  and november   we experienced adverse changes in our stock price resulting from a decline in our financial performance and adverse business conditions that have affected the technology industry  especially application software companies 
based on these factors  we performed a test for goodwill impairment at august  and november  and determined that based upon the implied fair value which includes factors such as  but not limited to  the company s market capitalization  control premium and recent stock price volatility of the company as of august  and november   there was no impairment of goodwill 
we performed another test for goodwill impairment as of february   our annual date for goodwill impairment review  and determined that our implied fair value was less than stockholders equity  including goodwill  an indication that goodwill may be impaired 
therefore  we performed the second step of the impairment test 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to reduce goodwill associated with our acquisitions to their estimated fair value as of that date 
the goodwill impairment loss was determined by calculating the difference between a our implied fair value as of february  less the fair value of our net assets and b the carrying value of goodwill 
the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets of the company were determined by an independent valuation 
our implied fair value was estimated based on the closing quoted market price of our common stock on february  multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares market capitalization plus an implied control premium  determined by an independent valuation firm  as if we were owned by a single stockholder 
the implied control premium used for purposes of measuring the implied fair value of the company was determined by review of the premiums paid by other companies in past public technology and software acquisitions 
we will continue to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  coinciding with our fiscal year end  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our implied fair value below our carrying value 
please refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further discussion of sfas  note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further discussion of our goodwill impairment and see factors that may affect future results risks related to our business 
determining the implied fair value of goodwill involves judgments as to when an impairment may exist  as well as estimates used to compute the implied fair value 
if the estimates used to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill were to change such that the fair value dropped below stockholders equity  this could result in an impairment charge for some or all of our goodwill balance 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider historical taxable income  estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is greater or less than the valuation allowance we have recorded 
based on various factors  including our cumulative losses for fiscal  and when adjusted for non recurring items  the size of our loss for fiscal and estimates of future profitability  management has concluded that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be insufficient to recover our net deferred tax assets 
based on the weight of positive and negative evidence regarding recoverability of our deferred tax assets  we recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets  which resulted in a million charge to income tax expense in the fiscal year ended february  management will continue to monitor its estimates of future profitability and realizability of our net deferred tax assets based on evolving business conditions 
restructuring related expenses our restructuring charges are comprised primarily of i severance and associated employee benefits related to the involuntary reduction of our workforce  ii lease termination costs  costs associated with permanently vacating facilities abandonment or both  and iii impairment costs related to certain long lived assets and leasehold improvements abandoned 
prior to december   we accounted for the costs associated with the reduction of our workforce in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
eitf 
accordingly  we recorded the liability related to involuntary termination costs when the following conditions were met i management with the appropriate level of authority approved a termination plan that committed us to such plan and established the benefits the employees would receive upon termination  ii the benefit arrangement was communicated to the employees in sufficient detail to enable the employees to determine the termination benefits  iii the plan specifically identified the number of employees to be terminated  their locations  and their job classifications  and iv the period of time to implement the plan did not indicate changes to the plan are likely 
the termination costs we record are not associated with  nor do they benefit  continuing activities 
prior to december   we accounted for lease termination costs in accordance with eitf accordingly  we recorded the costs associated with lease termination  abandonment or both when the following conditions were met i management with the appropriate level of authority approved a termination plan that committed us to such plan  ii the plan specifically identified all activities that would not to be continued  including the method of disposition and location of those activities  and the expected date of completion  iii the period of time to implement the plan does not indicate changes to the plan were likely  and iv the leased property had no substantive future use or benefit to us 
we recorded the liability associated with lease termination  abandonment or both as the sum of the total remaining lease costs and related exit costs  less probable sublease income or the expected lease termination fees or penalties 
we accounted for costs related to long lived assets abandoned in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and  accordingly  charged to expense the net carrying value of the long lived assets when we ceased to use the assets 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas on january  sfas nullifies eitf and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of a company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf and also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
accordingly  for exit or disposal activities undertaken after december   we recorded the liability related to involuntary termination costs  lease costs  abandonment costs or both and relocation costs as they were incurred 
inherent in the estimation of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish lease abandonments 
changing business and real estate market conditions may affect the assumptions related to the timing and extent of our ability to sublease vacated space 
we review the status of restructuring liabilities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  we record changes to our restructuring liabilities based on management s most current estimates 
revenue software revenue 
software revenue decreased  or million  in fiscal and decreased  or million  in fiscal the decrease in software revenue and software revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal and fiscal was due to the weakness of the global economy and geopolitical uncertainties in our fiscal and fiscal and the related decline in spending for enterprise application software 
this resulted in a decrease in the asp for our software during both fiscal and fiscal and a decrease in the number of significant software license transactions consummated during fiscal and fiscal the following table summarizes significant software transactions consummated during fiscal  and fiscal year ended february  significant software transactions number of transactions  to  number of transactions million and greater total number of transactions average selling price in thousands significant software transactions are those with a value of  or greater recognized within the fiscal year 
we believe the reduction in software transactions of million or greater in fiscal and fiscal is the result of companies becoming more cautious and deliberate regarding commitments to large capital expenditures  especially spending for enterprise application software  due to the uncertain global economic conditions and geopolitical uncertainties 
services revenue 
services revenue decreased  or million  in fiscal and increased  or million  in fiscal the decrease in services revenue in fiscal was the result of the decrease in the number of completed software license transactions in fiscal and fiscal and resulting lower demand for implementation services  offset by the services revenue from wds which was acquired in april the increase in services revenue in fiscal was due to an increased demand for implementation services and training  resulting from increases in completed software license transactions in fiscal and the acquisition of talus solutions  inc talus in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the decline in the number of completed software license transactions in fiscal  we believe that services revenue in fiscal will be lower than fiscal services revenue tends to track software license revenue in prior periods 
see forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results 
support revenue 
support revenue increased  or million  in fiscal and increased  or million  in fiscal the increase in support revenue in fiscal and fiscal was due to the increase in the base of clients that have licensed our software products and entered into annual support arrangements coupled with renewals of annual support agreements by our existing client base and the talus and wds acquisitions 
in the past  we have experienced high rates of renewed annual support contracts 
there can no assurance that our historical renewal rate will continue 
see forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results 
international revenue 
we market and sell our software and services internationally  primarily in europe  asia  canada and central and south america 
revenue outside of the united states decreased  or million  to million in fiscal and increased  or million  to million in fiscal revenue outside of the united states as a percentage of total revenue was  and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in our international revenue in fiscal resulted from the progressive weakening of global economic conditions  especially in the european economies  and geopolitical uncertainties  which resulted in delayed and smaller buying decisions by prospects and customers for our products 
the increase in our international revenue in fiscal resulted from our efforts to expand our presence and selling efforts outside of the united states 
operating expenses cost of software 
cost of software consists primarily of amortization of capitalized software development costs and royalty fees associated with third party software either embedded in our software or resold by us 
the following table sets forth amortization of capitalized software development costs and other costs of software for the three fiscal years ended february   and in thousands fiscal year ended february  amortization of capitalized software percentage of software revenue other costs of software percentage of software revenue total cost of software percentage of software revenue the decrease in cost of software in fiscal was the result of decreased royalty fees due to lower software revenue 
the increase in cost of software in fiscal was due to increased amortization of capitalized software resulting from an increase in the number of product development initiatives 
amortization of acquired technology 
in connection with our acquisitions of wds and dfe in fiscal  the acquisition of the collaborative sourcing and design assets of partminer csd  inc csd and spaceworks intellectual property during fiscal and certain previous acquisitions  we acquired developed technology that we offer as part of our integrated solutions 
acquired technology is amortized over periods ranging from four to six years 
we expect annual amortization of acquired technology to be approximately million in fiscal cost of services and support 
cost of services and support primarily includes personnel and third party contractor costs 
cost of services and support as a percentage of related revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal cost of services and support increased  or million  in fiscal and increased  or million  in fiscal the increase in cost of services and support during fiscal was attributable to an increase in support royalties paid to third parties and the wds acquisition in april  offset by the implementation of our cost containment and cost reduction initiatives during fiscal the increase in cost of services and support during fiscal was attributable to adding the personnel necessary to support the growth in services and support revenue and installed customer base 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs  sales commissions  promotional events such as user conferences  trade shows and technical conferences  advertising and public relations programs 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal sales and marketing expense decreased  or million in fiscal and increased  or million  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to an overall decrease in the average number of sales  marketing and business development employees to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  which was the result of cost containment and cost reduction measures implemented in the second half of fiscal and fiscal  a decrease in sales commissions due to lower software revenue  and a decrease in promotional spending  travel  advertising and public relations spending resulting from cost containment and cost reduction measures implemented in the second half of fiscal and fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to increased personnel costs resulting from an increase in the average number of sales  marketing and business development employees to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  offset by lower sales commissions resulting from decreased software sales 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal was due to the combination of lower sales commissions due to decreased software revenue and cost containment and cost reduction measures implemented in the second half of fiscal and fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal was due to the combination of lower sales commissions due to decreased software revenue  flat promotional spending and higher revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal product development 
product development costs include expenses associated with the development of new software products  enhancements of existing products and quality assurance activities and are reported net of capitalized software development costs 
such costs are primarily from employees and third party contractors 
the following table sets forth product development costs for the three fiscal years ended february   and in thousands fiscal year ended february  gross product development costs percentage of total revenue less capitalized software development costs percentage of total revenue product development costs  as reported percentage of total revenue gross product development costs decreased  or million  in fiscal and increased  or million  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to an increase in the proportion of our development work being performed by contractors in india in order to take advantage of cost efficiencies associated with india s lower wage scale  and a decrease in the average number of contractors in the united states resulting from cost containment and cost reduction measures implemented in the second half of fiscal and in fiscal this decrease was offset by an increase in gross product development costs resulting from the wds acquisition in april the increase in gross product development costs in fiscal was the result of an increase in the average number of product development employees  acquisitions during the first six months of fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal and an increased number of product development initiatives 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include personnel and other costs of our legal  finance  accounting  human resources  facilities and information systems functions 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or million  in fiscal and increased  or million  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to a decrease in the average number of general and administrative employees resulting from cost containment and cost reduction measures implemented in the second half of fiscal and fiscal  offset by an increase in costs resulting from the wds acquisition in april the increases in fiscal were due to an increase in personnel to support our growth 
amortization of intangibles and goodwill impairment 
our acquisitions of wds in april  csd and one release during fiscal and certain previous acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that represent the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired 
other intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from four to seven years 
amortization of intangibles decreased by  or million  in fiscal the decrease resulted from our adoption of sfas on march   which requires that we no longer amortize goodwill and assembled workforce 
sfas also requires that goodwill be tested for impairment on an annual basis and when there is reason to suspect that values may have been impaired 
we performed a test for goodwill impairment as of february   our annual date for goodwill impairment review and determined a write down was necessary 
accordingly  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in fiscal to reduce goodwill associated with our acquisitions down to their estimated fair value 
details of our amortization of intangibles and goodwill impairment are included in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and details of our acquisitions are included in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
purchased research and development and acquisition related expenses 
our acquisitions of wds in fiscal and talus and stg holdings  inc stg in fiscal included the purchase of technology that had not yet been determined to be technologically feasible and had no alternative future use at its then current stage of development 
accordingly  in fiscal and fiscal  the portion of the purchase price for wds  talus and stg allocated to purchased research and development of million and million  respectively  in aggregate  was expensed immediately in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
details of our acquisitions are included in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
restructuring and other impairment charges 
we adopted restructuring plans in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal and in the second and third quarters of fiscal in connection with our decision to implement these plans  we incurred related restructuring and other impairment charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  including million in additional restructuring charges related to the expected loss of a sublease income on office space at a location previously included as a component of the restructuring plan 
the following table sets forth a summary of restructuring and other impairment charges  net of adjustments  for fiscal and in thousands fiscal year ended february  lease obligations and terminations severance and related benefits impairment charges other total restructuring and other impairment charges the impact to reported basic and diluted loss per share as a result of the restructuring and other impairment charges was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
as a result of the adoption of our restructuring plans in fiscal  we reduced our operating expenses by million annually 
our restructuring plans and cost containment initiatives in fiscal further reduced certain of our operating expenses by approximately million annually from the cost structure for our quarter ended may  the cost savings associated with our restructuring and cost containment efforts began to be realized in the following quarter 
we do not expect our cost savings to be offset by increases in other expense areas 
details of our restructuring and other impairment charges are included in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
a summary of approximate annual cost savings associated with our restructuring plans is as follows in thousands fiscal year ended february  fiscal fiscal restructuring plans restructuring plans functional expense cost of services and support sales marketing product development general and administrative total expense type salaries benefits contractors promotion travel depreciation office expenses total our aggregate cost of software  cost of services and support  sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses  excluding amortization of acquired technology and non cash stock compensation expense  was million for the quarter ended may  we expect the comparable quarterly costs to be approximately million for the quarter ended may   representing a reduction in quarterly costs of approximately million  or approximately million annually 
non cash stock compensation expense benefit 
we recognized non cash stock compensation expense benefit of million in fiscal related to unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition of talus and million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  related to stock options that were repriced in january and unvested stock options assumed in the talus acquisition 
these amounts are included as a separate component of stockholders equity and are amortized by charges to operations in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
repriced options in january  the company repriced certain employee stock options  other than those held by executive officers or directors 
this resulted in approximately million options being repriced and the four year vesting period starting over 
under fin  repriced options are subject to variable plan accounting  which requires compensation cost or benefit to be recorded each period based on changes in our stock price until the repriced options are exercised  forfeited or expire 
this resulted in a benefit of million in fiscal and an expense of million in fiscal the initial fair value used to measure the ongoing stock compensation charge or benefit was based on the closing price of our common stock on june  since our stock price at the beginning and end our fiscal quarters was below  no charge or benefit was recorded during fiscal as of february   approximately million repriced options were still outstanding  all of which are fully vested 
in future periods  we will record additional charges or benefits related to the repriced stock options still outstanding based on the change in our common stock price compared to the last reporting period 
if our stock price at the beginning and end of any reporting period is less than  no charge or benefit will be recorded 
unvested stock options talus acquisition as part of the talus acquisition  we assumed all outstanding stock options  which were converted into our stock options 
options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock were unvested at the acquisition date 
fin requires the acquiring company to measure the intrinsic value of unvested stock options assumed at the acquisition date in a purchase business combination and record a compensation charge over the remaining vesting period of those options to the extent those options remain outstanding 
this resulted in a charge of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million during fiscal iri settlement 
the iri settlement charge of million in fiscal represents the amount in excess of a liability accrued in prior years for the resolution of a dispute between the company and information resources  inc iri 
details of the iri settlement are included in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report

provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million in fiscal  a benefit from income tax of million in fiscal and an income tax provision of million in fiscal during fiscal  management concluded that  based on various factors  including our cumulative losses for fiscal  and when adjusted for non recurring items  the size of our loss for fiscal and estimates of future profitability  future taxable income will  more likely than not  be insufficient to cover our net deferred tax assets 
based on the weight of positive and negative evidence regarding recoverability of our deferred tax assets net operating loss carryforwards  we recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets  which resulted in a million charge to income tax expense in fiscal management will continue to monitor its estimates of future profitability and realizability of our net deferred tax assets based on evolving business conditions 
we do not expect to record a deferred income tax benefit in future periods when we incur a loss 
net loss we reported a net loss of million  million and million for fiscal years ending february   and  respectively 
the increased net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an increased operating loss resulting from a decrease in total revenue  the goodwill impairment charge in fiscal  increased restructuring and other impairment charges  purchased research and development associated with the wds acquisition and income tax charges in fiscal compared to income tax benefits in fiscal  offset by the favorable effect of the non amortization provisions of sfas beginning march  and a decrease in the aggregate cost of software  cost of services and support  sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses 
the increased net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an increased operating loss resulting from an increase in amortization expense  restructuring and other impairment charges  the iri settlement and the converge  inc investment impairment  offset by income tax benefits in fiscal compared to income tax charges in fiscal and a decrease in purchased research and development charges 
loss per common share loss per common share is computed in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share  which requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for entities with complex capital structures 
basic earnings loss per common share is based on net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings or loss per common share include  when dilutive  i the effect of stock options and warrants granted using the treasury stock method  ii the effect of contingently issuable shares earned during the period  and iii shares issuable under the conversion feature of our convertible notes using the if converted method 
future weighted average shares outstanding calculations will be impacted by the following factors the ongoing issuance of common stock associated with stock option and warrant exercises  the issuance of common shares associated with our employee stock purchase plan  any fluctuations in our stock price  which could cause changes in the number of common stock equivalents included in the diluted earnings per common share calculations to the extent we have net income  the issuance of common stock to raise capital or effect business combinations should we enter into such transactions  assumed or actual conversions of our convertible debt into common stock

the notes mature in november and are convertible by the holder into approximately million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
the conversion price of the notes will be adjusted in the event that we issue our common stock as a dividend or distribution with respect to our common stock  we subdivide  combine or reclassify our common stock  we issue rights to our common stockholders to purchase our common stock at less than market price  we make certain distributions of securities  cash or other property to our common stockholders other than ordinary cash dividends  or we make certain repurchases of our common stock 
upon a change of control of the company  the holders of the notes would have the right to require us or our successor to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase in cash 
the notes do not have any financial covenants 
on or after november   we may redeem  from time to time  the notes in whole or in part  at our option

the redemption price  expressed as a percentage of the principal amount  is redemption period redemption price november  through october  november  through october  november  through october  november  through maturity on january   we entered into a one year unsecured revolving credit facility with svb for million 
under the terms of this credit facility  we may request cash advances  letters of credit  or both 
the credit facility requires us to comply with the following financial covenants i minimum tangible net worth defined as stockholders equity plus convertible debt less goodwill  capitalized software costs and other intangible assets must be greater than million as of february   with future quarters covenants to be determined during the first quarter of fiscal  and ii a ratio of a cash and cash equivalents deposited with svb and its affiliates plus accounts receivable to b current liabilities plus  long term indebtedness to svb and outstanding letters of credit minus deferred revenue of at least to in addition  the svb credit facility requires us to maintain million in funds with svb and its affiliates

under the terms of the svb credit facility  we maintain the right to terminate the facility at any time upon repayment of any advances and the posting of cash collateral for any outstanding letters of credit 
under the credit facility  svb has the right to obtain a lien on all of our assets  other than intellectual property  upon an occurrence of default  unless we terminate the facility as provided above 
the credit facility also provides that  upon an event of default  we are prohibited from paying a cash dividend to our shareholders 
as of february   we had million in letters of credit outstanding under this line to secure our lease obligations for office space 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of february  prior to entering into our credit facility agreement with svb  we had a credit facility agreement with boa that expired on february  as of february   we had million in letters of credit outstanding with boa which were fully collateralized 
the cash collateral is presented as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet as of february  the cash restriction with boa will be eliminated once all outstanding letters of credit have been transferred to svb 
approximately million of the boa letters of credit were transferred to svb in march and those related cash restrictions have been eliminated 
we are in the process of transferring the remaining outstanding letters of credit to svb 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
in april  the company entered into a credit agreement with svb  as amended  under which the company could borrow up to million for the purchase of equipment 
amounts borrowed under the facility accrue interest at a rate equal to the greater of the three year treasury note rate plus or  and are repaid monthly over a month period 
during fiscal  the company borrowed million under this credit facility 
the facility allowed for borrowings through march  we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of february  as of february   the company s future fixed commitments and the effect these commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended february or  thereafter total capital lease obligations operating lease obligations not in restructuring operating leases obligations in restructuring equipment line of credit convertible subordinated notes total fixed commitments includes principal and interest payments the lease commitments in the above table designated as operating lease obligations in restructuring only include the non cancelable portion of lease commitments included in past restructuring initiatives and  accordingly  have not been reduced by estimated sublease income 
however  as required by eitf issue no 
costs associated with lease modification or termination 
eitf  we have reduced these lease commitments by estimated sublease income in determining the total restructuring lease obligations of million recorded in the accompanying balance sheet as of february  please refer to notes and in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
in the future  we may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
in addition  we may make strategic investments in businesses and enter into joint ventures that complement our existing business 
any future acquisition or investment may result in a decrease to our liquidity and working capital to the extent we pay with cash 
we believe that our existing liquidity and expected cash flows from operations will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we believe that the combination of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund expected capital expenditures  capital lease obligations and working capital needs for the next twelve months 
however  weakening economic conditions or continued weak demand for enterprise application software in future periods could have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and liquidity 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may choose to purchase a portion of the notes in the open market from time to time if we are able to do so on terms favorable to us 
purchases of the notes would reduce our debt outstanding  but may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may elect to obtain additional debt or equity financing if we are able to raise it on terms favorable to us 
see forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on march   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas business combinations  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  with the exception of the immediate requirement to use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas establishes new standards for accounting and reporting for business combinations and requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas requires goodwill and certain intangible assets to remain on the balance sheet and not be amortized 
therefore  we stopped amortizing goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  on march  in addition  sfas requires assembled workforce and certain other identifiable intangible assets to be reclassified as goodwill 
on an annual basis  and when there is reason to suspect that values may have been impaired  goodwill must be tested for impairment and write downs may be necessary 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
sfas also requires recognized intangible assets with finite lives to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
sfas required us to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill was impaired at the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we were required to identify our reporting units and determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
the first test for potential impairment required us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value which includes factors such as  but not limited to  our market capitalization  control premium and recent stock price volatility of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
we performed the initial goodwill impairment test required by sfas during the first quarter of fiscal we consider ourselves to have a single reporting unit 
accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company 
as of march   based on our implied fair value  there was no impairment of goodwill 
during the quarters ended august  and november   we experienced adverse changes in our stock price resulting from a decline in our financial performance and adverse business conditions that have affected the technology industry  especially application software companies 
based on these factors  we performed a test for goodwill impairment at august  and november  and determined that based upon the implied fair value which includes factors such as  but not limited to  the company s market capitalization  control premium and recent stock price volatility of the company as of august  and november   there was no impairment of goodwill 
we performed another test for goodwill impairment as of february   our annual date for goodwill impairment review and determined the implied fair value of the company was less than stockholders equity  including goodwill  an indication that goodwill may be impaired 
therefore  we performed the second step of the impairment test 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to reduce goodwill associated with our acquisitions to their estimated fair value as of that date 
the goodwill impairment loss was determined by calculating the difference between a our implied fair value as of february  less the fair value of our net assets and b the carrying value of goodwill 
our implied fair value was estimated based on the closing quoted market price of the our common stock on february  multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares market capitalization plus an implied control premium as if we were owned by a single stockholder 
we will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis  coinciding with our fiscal year end  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our implied fair value below our carrying value 
if our stock price decreases to levels such that our implied fair value is significantly less than stockholders equity for a sustained period of time  among other factors  we may be required to record additional impairment losses related to goodwill below its carrying amount 
we will perform a test for goodwill impairment at february   which is our annual date for goodwill impairment review  or earlier if conditions are present which may indicate an impairment 
please refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further discussion of sfas  note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further discussion of our goodwill impairment and see factors that may affect future results risks related to our business 
effective march   as required by sfas  we have ceased amortization of goodwill associated with acquisitions completed prior to july  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations initiated before july  were amortized until february  sfas does not require the restatement of prior period earnings  but does require transitional disclosure for earnings per share and adjusted net income under the revised rules see note 
on march   we adopted the provisions of sfas sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  but retains the fundamental provisions of sfas for i recognition measurement of impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and ii measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board s opinion no 
apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for segments of a business to be disposed of but retains apb s reporting requirement to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting requirement to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
on march   we adopted the provisions of staff announcement topic no 
d income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which was subsequently incorporated in emerging issues task force no 
eitf 
eitf establishes that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  hotel stays and similar costs should be characterized as revenue in the income statement 
adoption of the guidance had the resulting effect of increased revenue and increased operating expenses 
prior to our adoption of this standard  we recorded out of pocket expense reimbursements as a reduction of cost of services 
accordingly  we reclassified these amounts to revenue in our comparative financial statements beginning in our first quarter of fiscal application of eitf did not result in any net impact to operating income or net income in any past periods and will not result in any net impact in future periods 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities ie  restructuring activities  including costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits due to employees who are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement 
sfas supersedes eitf and eitf and therefore prohibits recognition of a liability based solely on an entity s commitment to a plan to exit an activity 
sfas requires that i liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities be measured at fair value and changes in the fair value of the liability at each reporting period be measured using an interest allocation approach  ii one time termination benefits be expensed at the date the entity notifies the employee  unless the employee must provide future service  in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period  iii liabilities to terminate a contract be recorded at fair value when the contract is terminated  iv liabilities related to an existing operating lease  unless terminated  be recorded at fair value  less estimated sublease income  and measured when the contract does not have any future economic benefit to the entity ie  the entity ceases to utilize the rights conveyed by the contract  and v all other costs related to an exit or disposal activity be expensed as incurred 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  retroactive application of sfas is prohibited and  accordingly  liabilities recognized prior to the initial application of sfas must continue to be accounted for in accordance with eitf  eitf or other applicable preexisting guidance 
accordingly  we will continue to account for its restructuring obligations recorded during in accordance with eitf  eitf or other applicable preexisting guidance 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others interpretation 
interpretation elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit  and provides new disclosure requirements regarding indemnification provisions  including indemnification provisions typically included in a software license arrangement 
it also clarifies that at the time a guarantee is issued  we must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations we assume under the guarantee and must disclose that information in our financial statements 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee do not apply to product warranties  indemnification provisions in our software license arrangements  or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   and the disclosure requirements apply to guarantees outstanding as of december  adoption of interpretation will not have a material effect on our operating performance or financial condition 
in december  statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  was issued 
sfas amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method used on the reported results 
the disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  and interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of this statement did not impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating us and our business 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial  may also materially impair our operating performance and financial condition 
risks related to our indebtedness and financial condition our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in november  we completed a convertible debt offering of million in subordinated convertible notes the notes that are due november our indebtedness could have important consequences for investors 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing  require the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of capital to fund our operations  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors 
although we have no present plans to do so  we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
while the terms of our credit facility imposes certain limits on our ability to incur additional debt  we are permitted to incur additional debt subject to compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement 
moreover  the terms of the notes set forth no limits on our ability to incur additional debt 
if a significant amount of new debt is added to our current levels  the related risks described above could intensify 
we may have insufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
we will be required to generate cash sufficient to pay all amounts due on the notes and to conduct our business operations 
the notes require interest payments of million annually with million of principal due november as of february   the remaining principal and interest payments due under the notes were million 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  excluding restricted cash of million  was million as of february  assuming our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities remain constant from our february  levels  we will have to generate million of net cash flow through any combination of normal operations of the company  raising of debt and equity capital or asset sales by november to meet our remaining principal and interest payments under the notes 
we have incurred net losses in the past  and we may not be able to cover our anticipated debt service obligations 
this may materially hinder our ability to make principal and interest payments on the notes 
our ability to meet our future debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we may choose to purchase a portion of our convertible subordinated notes in the open market which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
although we have no present plans to do so  we may choose to purchase a portion of our convertible subordinated notes outstanding from time to time in the open market in future periods 
this action would be contingent on approval of our board of directors and on compliance with the conditions of applicable securities laws 
while the terms of our credit facility imposes certain limits on our ability to repurchase our debt securities  we are permitted to do so subject to compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement 
purchases of convertible subordinated notes in the open market would be funded from available cash and cash equivalents and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
we may violate financial covenants under our credit facility which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
during fiscal  our financial performance made it difficult for us to achieve the financial covenants under our credit facility with boa 
during november  we were required to cash collateralize million of outstanding letters of credit under the boa credit facility as a result of violating a financial covenant 
also  we violated the consolidated ebitda covenant under the boa credit facility for the quarter ended november  as of february   million of outstanding letters of credit was still held as collateral 
in january  we entered into a new unsecured credit facility with svb to replace the boa credit facility  which should eliminate most  if not all  of the cash restriction described above by the end of our first quarter fiscal approximately million of the boa letters of credit were transferred to svb in march and these cash restrictions have been eliminated 
we are in the process of transferring the remaining outstanding letters of credit to svb 
however  if our future financial performance results in a violation of financial covenants under the new credit facility with svb in future periods  we could be required to provide cash collateral for outstanding borrowings or letters of credit  which would have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and financial condition 
risks related to our business adverse economic and political conditions have caused a deterioration of the markets for our products and services and have adversely affected and could further adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition 
our revenue and operating results depend on the overall demand for our software and related services 
regional and global adverse changes in the economy and political upheaval and unrest have caused a deterioration of the markets for our products and services 
this has resulted in reductions  delays and postponements of customer purchases  which materially adversely affected our financial performance during fiscal and demand for our pricing and revenue optimization and our supplier relationship management products has been more severely impacted than our supply chain management and service parts management products for which there are more mature markets 
although our markets in most industries and geographies have deteriorated  industries most severely impacted include  among others  chemicals and energy  high technology  manufacturing and travel  transportation hospitality 
industries less affected include automotive  consumer packaged goods  food beverage  life sciences and retail 
if these adverse conditions continue or worsen  we would likely experience further reductions  delays  and postponements of customer purchases further adversely affecting our operating performance and financial condition 
national and global responses to future hostilities and terrorist attacks may materially adversely affect demand for our software and services because of the economic and political effects on our markets and by interrupting the ability of our customers to do business in the ordinary course  as a result of a variety of factors  including  among others  changes or disruptions in movement and sourcing of materials  goods and components or the possible interruption in the flow of information or monies 
we have experienced significant losses in recent years due to operational difficulties in fiscal and the first half of fiscal and to a deterioration of our markets resulting from weakening economic conditions and increased political instability commencing in fiscal we have recently incurred significant losses 
we experienced operational difficulties in fiscal and the first half of fiscal problems with our direct sales operation and intense competition  among other factors  contributed to net losses in fiscal and fiscal and a decline in revenue in fiscal thereafter  our financial performance began to improve under our new management team 
however  beginning in fiscal  weakening economic conditions and increased political instability resulted in a deterioration in our markets 
we experienced sequential declines in software and total revenue during our second and third quarters of fiscal further weakening of economic conditions  which severely impacted the timing of capital spending decisions for computer software  particularly enterprise application software  further negatively impacted the markets for our products and services 
this again resulted in sequential quarterly declines in software and total revenue in our first three quarters of fiscal the losses incurred during these periods were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal our ability to improve our financial performance will depend on a stabilization or improvement of economic conditions resulting in increased demand for our software or our ability to align our cost structure with revenue without retarding our ability to grow revenue in future periods 
if market conditions for our software do not improve or if we do not successfully align our cost structure with our revenue without retarding our ability to grow revenue  our operating performance and financial condition could be harmed  and we could continue to incur significant losses 
we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in our fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of severe declines in our stock price over fiscal if our stock price decreases to levels such that the implied fair value of the company is significantly less than stockholders equity for a sustained period of time  we may be required to record additional significant non cash charges associated with goodwill impairment 
on march   we adopted sfas  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only method 
effective march   we stopped amortizing goodwill but will continue amortizing other intangible assets with finite lives 
as required by the provisions of sfas  we performed the initial goodwill impairment test required during our first quarter of fiscal we consider ourselves to have a single reporting unit 
accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with our entire company 
as of march   based upon our implied fair value  there was no impairment of goodwill recorded upon implementation of sfas during the quarters ended august   november  and february   we experienced adverse changes in our stock price resulting from a decline in our financial performance caused by adverse business conditions that have affected the technology industry  especially application software companies 
based on these factors  we performed a test for goodwill impairment at august   november  and february  and determined that based upon the implied fair value which includes factors such as  but not limited to  the company s market capitalization  control premium and recent stock price volatility of the company as of august  and november   there was no impairment of goodwill  and as of february   there was an impairment of goodwill 
as a result of the impairment of goodwill as of february   we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million to reduce goodwill associated with our acquisitions to their estimated fair value as of that date 
we will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis  coinciding with our fiscal year end  or on an interim basis if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying value 
if our stock price is lower than recent levels such that the implied fair value of the company is significantly less than stockholders equity for a sustained period of time  among other factors  we may be required to record an additional impairment loss related to goodwill below its carrying amount 
we will perform a test for goodwill impairment at february   which is our annual date for goodwill impairment review  or earlier if conditions are present which may indicate an impairment 
our future results will be adversely affected by several types of significant non cash charges which could impair our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
we will incur significant non cash charges in the future related to the amortization of intangible assets  including acquired technology relating to the wds  dfe  stg  csd  spaceworks  inc and talus acquisitions and non cash stock compensation expenses associated with our acquisition of talus 
in addition  we have incurred and may in the future incur non cash stock compensation charges related to our stock option repricing in january during fiscal  we announced that we were required to write off our investment in converge  inc  which resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
in the three months ended august   we recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets which resulted in a million non cash charge to income tax expense 
in the three months ended february   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to reduce goodwill associated with our acquisitions to their estimated fair value as of that date 
we may also incur non cash charges in future periods related to impairments of long lived assets 
to achieve profitability we must grow our revenue sufficiently to cover these charges 
our failure to achieve profitability could cause our stock price to decline 
our operating performance has been negatively impacted by the progressive weakening of global economic conditions and increased political instability which resulted in a deterioration of our markets 
in fiscal and fiscal  we recorded certain restructuring charges and enacted cost containment and cost reduction measures in response to the downturn in our markets 
if our restructuring plans and our cost containment and cost reduction measures fail to achieve the desired results or result in unanticipated negative consequences  or if our markets continue to experience weakness  we may suffer material harm to our operating performance and financial condition 
because of the downturn in our markets as a result of progressive weakening of global economic conditions and increased political instability during fiscal and fiscal  we faced new challenges in our ability to stabilize revenue and operating performance and expand market share 
in response to the impact on our financial performance  we implemented restructuring plans and cost containment and cost reduction measures to reduce our cost structure  which included  among other things  workforce reductions and mandatory unpaid leave programs 
in fiscal and  we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
in addition  we expect to incur incremental restructuring charges of approximately million in our first quarter of fiscal as a result of the cost containment and cost reduction initiatives commenced in our fourth quarter of fiscal  which include subleasing approximately of our corporate headquarters space for an amount less than our current rent obligation 
we expect to sublease the space by august  if we fail to achieve the desired results of our restructuring plans and our cost containment and cost reduction measures or if our markets continue to experience weakness  we may suffer material harm to our operating performance and financial condition 
we have reduced our workforce as part of our recent cost containment and cost reduction initiatives 
if we fail to field and retain a qualified workforce  our operating performance and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we believe that our success depends on our ability to motivate and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  sales  marketing and services personnel 
competition for skilled personnel can be intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting  motivating and retaining the personnel required to improve our financial performance and grow 
in addition  the cost of hiring and retaining skilled employees is high 
failure to attract and retain highly skilled personnel could materially and adversely affect our business 
our recent cost containment and cost reduction initiatives may yield unintended consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce  reduced employee morale and decreased productivity 
in addition  the recent trading levels of our stock have decreased the value of our stock options granted to employees under our stock option plans 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may seek alternate employment  such as with larger  more established companies or companies that they perceive as having less volatile stock prices or better prospects 
continuity of personnel is a very important factor in sales and implementation of our software and our product development efforts 
attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce or a material decrease in employee morale or productivity could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
our president  executive vice president of pricing and revenue management and president of european operations resigned in fiscal the success and growth of our business may suffer if we lose additional key personnel 
our success depends significantly on the continued service of our executive officers 
three of our executive officers recently left the company 
gregory cudahy  former executive vice president of pricing and revenue management resigned in may richard bergmann  our former president  who had been on a personal leave of absence since june  resigned effective october  terrence a 
austin  our former executive vice president of european operations  resigned effective january  andrew hogenson  who has been with the company since  most recently as our senior vice president of product development  replaced gregory cudahy 
gregory owens  chairman and chief executive officer  has assumed certain of richard bergmann s duties 
jean claude walravens  who has been with the company since  most recently as our vice president sales  southern europe  replaced mr 
austin as our senior vice president and president of european operations 
we do not have fixed term employment agreements with any of our executive officers  and we do not maintain key person life insurance on our executive officers 
the loss of services of any of our executive officers for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we have reduced our sales force as part of our recent cost containment and cost reduction initiatives 
if we fail to field an effective sales organization  our ability to grow will be limited  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we have reduced our sales force in fiscal and fiscal as a result of the deterioration in our markets 
decreasing software revenue and mandatory leave programs have resulted in reduced compensation earned by members of our sales force  which may result in further voluntary attrition of our sales force over time 
in order to grow our revenue  our existing sales force will have to be more productive  and we will likely expand our sales force when the markets for our products and solutions improve 
our past efforts to expand our sales organization have required significant resources 
new sales personnel require training and take time to achieve full productivity 
there is no assurance that our existing salesforce will become more productive or that we will achieve increased productivity in our existing sales force and successfully attract and retain qualified sales people at levels sufficient to support growth 
any failure to adequately sell our products could limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
the sales cycles for our products and services can be long and unpredictable 
variations in the time it takes us to license our software may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
the time it takes to license our software to prospective clients varies substantially  but typically has ranged historically between three and twelve months 
variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenue to fluctuate widely from period to period 
because we typically recognize a substantial portion of our software revenue in the last month of a quarter  any delay in the licensing of our products could cause significant variations in our revenue from quarter to quarter 
these delays have occurred on a number of occasions in the past and materially adversely affected our financial performance 
furthermore  these fluctuations could cause our operating results to suffer in some future periods because our operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short term  and we devote significant time and resources to prospective clients 
the length of our sales cycle depends on a number of factors  including the following the complexities of client challenges our solutions address  the size  timing and complexity of contractual terms of licenses and sales of our products and services  wide variations in contractual terms  which may result in deferred recognition of revenue  customer financial constraints and credit worthiness  the breadth of the solution required by the client  including the technical  organizational and geographic scope of the license  the evaluation and approval processes employed by the clients and prospects  which has become more complex and lengthy  economic  political and market conditions  and any other delays arising from factors beyond our control 
failure to maintain our service rates for implementation services could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the hourly rates we are able to charge for our implementation services consultants 
implementation services are typically billed on a hourly basis time and materials and sometimes under fixed price contracts 
implementation services billed on an hourly basis are generally recognized as the work is performed 
if we are not able to maintain the current hourly service rates for our implementation services  without corresponding cost reductions  our operating performance may suffer 
the hourly rates we are able to charge for our implementation services depend on a number of factors  including the following our clients and prospects perceptions of our ability to add value through our implementation services  competition  pricing policies of our competitors and systems integrators  the use of globally sourced  lower cost service delivery capabilities within our industry  and general economic conditions 
changes in the size of our software transactions may cause material fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
the size of our software transactions fluctuates 
fluctuations in the size of our software transactions have occurred  and may in the future occur  as a result of changes in demand for our software and services 
losses of  or delays in concluding  larger software transactions have had and could have a proportionately greater effect on our revenue and financial performance for a particular period 
for example  we recorded software transactions of million or greater in fiscal  software transactions of million or greater in fiscal  software transactions of million or greater in fiscal and software transactions of million or greater in fiscal as a result of these changes in the size of our software transactions  our quarterly revenue and financial performance have fluctuated significantly and may cause significant fluctuations in the future 
we experienced declines in software revenue in fiscal and fiscal a reduction in our revenue derived from software licenses resulted and may in the future result in reduced services and support revenue 
our ability to maintain or increase services revenue depends on our ability to maintain or increase the amount of software we license to customers 
during our fourth quarter fiscal and third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we experienced a decline in services revenue as a result of declining software revenue in prior periods 
additional decreases or slowdowns in licensing may have a material adverse effect on our services and support revenues in future periods 
in our third quarter of fiscal we experienced a sequential decline in support revenue compared to our second quarter of fiscal resulting from both the recent decline in software revenue and clients not renewing or partially renewing existing support contracts 
further declines in software revenue  a reduction in the renewal rate of annual support contracts  or both  could result in a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
our support revenue includes post contract support and the rights to unspecified software upgrades and enhancements 
support contracts are generally renewable annually at the option of our customers 
we have experienced high rates of renewed annual support contracts from our customers 
if our software revenue does not grow and if our customers fail to renew or to fully renew their support contracts at historical rates  our support revenue could materially decline 
we have a recent history of supplementing our organic revenue growth through acquisitions of business and technology 
acquisitions increase business risk 
we have experienced difficulties integrating acquisitions in the past 
acquisitions involve the integration of companies that have previously operated independently and increase the business risk of the acquirer 
in fiscal and we acquired the products and operations of talus  stg  onerelease and csd and the technology of spaceworks 
during our first quarter of fiscal  we acquired the assets and businesses of wds and dfe 
in connection with these and any future acquisitions  there can be no assurance that we will effectively integrate employees  operations  products and systems  realize the expected benefits of the transaction  retain key employees  effectively develop and protect key technologies and proprietary know how  avoid conflicts with our clients and business partners that have commercial relationships or compete with the acquired company  avoid unanticipated operational difficulties or expenditures or both  and effectively operate our existing business lines  given the significant diversion of resources and management attention required to successfully integrate acquisitions 
although we are not currently contemplating any acquisitions  future acquisitions may result in a dilution to existing shareholders to the extent we issue shares of our common stock as consideration or reduced liquidity and capital resources to the extent we use cash as consideration 
if the markets for our products do not grow or suffer further declines  our operating performance and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
substantially all of our software  services and support revenue have arisen from  or are related directly to  our solutions 
we expect to continue to be dependent upon these solutions in the future  and any factor adversely affecting the markets for our solutions would materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue 
the markets for our solutions have been and may continue to be materially adversely affected by continuing or further deteriorating economic and political conditions 
while we believe the markets for our solutions will expand as the economy improves  they may grow more slowly than in the past or anticipated 
if the markets for our solutions further decline or do not grow as rapidly as we expect  revenue growth  operating margins  or both  could be adversely affected 
our markets are very competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the markets for our solutions are very competitive 
the intensity of competition in our markets has significantly increased in part as a result of the deterioration in our markets 
we expect this intensity of competition to increase in the future 
our current and potential competitors may make acquisitions of other competitors and may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
some competitors are offering software that competes with ours at little or no charge as components of bundled products or on a stand alone basis 
smaller niche software companies have been and will likely continue to develop unique offerings that compete effectively with some of our solutions 
further  our current or prospective clients and partners may become competitors in the future 
increased competition has resulted and in the future could result in price reductions  lower gross margins  longer sales cycles and the loss of market share 
each of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do  and therefore  we may be at a disadvantage in competing with them 
we directly compete with other enterprise application software vendors including adexa  aspen technology  the descartes systems group  global logistics technologies  i technologies  jda software  khimetrics  logility  logisitics 
com recently acquired by manhattan associates  mercia  metreo  pros revenue management  retek  sap  viewlocity formerly synquest and yieldstar technology 
certain erp vendors  in addition to sap  all of which are substantially larger than manugistics  have acquired or developed supply chain management and supplier relationship management software companies  products  or functionality or have announced intentions to develop and sell supply chain management and supplier relationship management solutions 
such vendors include invensys  jd edwards company  oracle and peoplesoft 
some of our current and potential competitors  particularly the erp vendors  have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other competitive resources than we do  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed base of clients 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential clients and have extensive knowledge of our industry 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
any of these factors could materially impair our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
if the development of our products and services fails to keep pace with our industry s rapidly evolving technology  our future results may be materially and adversely affected 
the markets for our solutions are subject to rapid technological change  changing client needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
we have historically been successful in keeping pace with these changes  but if we fail to do so in the future  our products and services may be rendered less competitive or obsolete 
our product development and testing efforts have required  and are expected to continue to require  substantial investments 
we recently released a web native version of certain of our products and will continue to develop and release web native versions of our products 
we may not possess sufficient resources to continue to make further necessary investments in technology 
recent cutbacks in our workforce could lengthen the time necessary to develop our products 
in addition  we may not successfully identify new software opportunities or develop and bring new software to market in a timely and efficient manner 
our growth and future operating results will depend  in part  upon our ability to continue to enhance existing applications and develop and introduce new applications or capabilities that meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace  meet changing market and client requirements  including rapid realization of benefits and the need to rapidly manage and analyze increasingly large volumes of data  comply with changing industry standards  achieve market acceptance  integrate third party software effectively  and respond to competitive offerings 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new and enhanced software in a timely manner  we may lose existing clients and fail to attract new clients  which may have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
defects in our software or problems in the implementation of our software could lead to claims for damages by our clients  loss of revenue or delays in the market acceptance of our solutions 
our software is complex 
this complexity can make it difficult to detect errors or failure in our software prior to implementation 
we may not discover errors in our software until our customers install and use a given product or until the volume of services that a product provides increases 
when our software is installed  the environment into which it is installed is frequently complex and typically contains a wide variety of systems and third party software  with which our software must be integrated 
this can make the process of implementation difficult and lengthy 
as a result  some customers may have difficulty or be unable to implement our products successfully within anticipated timeframes or otherwise achieve the expected benefits 
these problems may result in claims for damages suffered by our clients  a loss of  or delays in  the market acceptance of our solutions  client dissatisfaction and lost revenue and collection difficulties during the period required to correct these errors 
we utilize third party software that we incorporate into and include with our products and solutions  and impaired relations with these third parties  defects in third party software or the inability to enhance their software over time could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we incorporate and include third party software into and with our products and solutions 
we are likely to incorporate and include additional third party software into and with our products and solutions as we expand our product offerings 
if our relations with any of these third party software providers are impaired  and if we are unable to obtain or develop a replacement for the software  our business could be harmed 
the operation of our products would be impaired if errors occur in the third party software that we utilize 
it may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third party software because the software is not within our control 
accordingly  our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software 
there can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the software capabilities 
we utilize third parties to integrate our software with other software products and platforms 
if any of these third parties should cease to provide integration services to us  our operating performance and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we depend on companies such as business objects  inovus  tibco software  vignette  and webmethods to integrate our software with software and platforms developed by third parties 
if relations with any of these third parties is impaired  and if we are unable to secure a replacement on a timely basis  our operating performance and financial condition could be harmed 
if these companies are unable to develop or maintain software that effectively integrates our software and is free from defects  our ability to license our products and provide solutions could be impaired and our operating performance and financial condition could be harmed 
there can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance their software s capabilities 
our efforts to develop and sustain relationships with vendors such as software companies  consulting firms  resellers and others to implement and promote our software products may fail  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we are developing  maintaining and enhancing significant working relationships with complementary vendors  such as software companies  consulting firms  resellers and others that we believe can play important roles in marketing our products and solutions 
we are currently investing  and intend to continue to invest  significant resources to develop and enhance these relationships  which could adversely affect our operating margins 
we may be unable to develop relationships with organizations that will be able to market our products effectively 
our arrangements with these organizations are not exclusive and  in many cases  may be terminated by either party without cause 
many of the organizations with which we are developing or maintaining marketing relationships have commercial relationships with our competitors 
there can be no assurance that any organization will continue its involvement with us and our products 
the loss of relationships with important organizations could materially and adversely affect on our operating performance and financial condition 
as a result of the wds acquisition  an increased percentage of our revenue will be derived from contracts with the government 
government contracts are subject to cost audits by the government and termination for the convenience of the government 
the adverse result of a government audit or government termination of any of our contracts with the government could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
although we have existing engagements for the defense logistics agency  united states navy and united states airforce  the wds acquisition will significantly increase the percentage of our revenue derived from contracts with the federal government 
government contractors are commonly subject to various audits and investigations by government agencies 
one agency that oversees or enforces contract performance is the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
the dcaa generally performs a review of a contractor s performance on its contracts  its pricing practices  costs and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards and to verify that costs have been properly charged to the government 
although the dcaa has completed an initial review of our accounting practices and procedures allowing us to invoice the government  it has yet to exercise its option to perform an audit of our actual invoicing of government contracts 
these audits may occur several years after completion of the audited work 
if an audit were to identify significant unallowable costs  we could have a material charge to our earnings or reduction to our cash position as a result of the audit and this could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
in addition  government contracts may be subject to termination by the government for its convenience  as well as termination  reduction or modification in the event of budgetary constraints or any change in the government s requirements 
if one of our time and materials or fixed priced contracts were to be terminated for the government s convenience  we would only receive the purchase price for items delivered prior to termination  reimbursement for allowable costs for work in progress and an allowance for profit on the contract  or an adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss 
government contracts are also conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations 
congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis  even though the contract performance may extend over many years 
consequently  at the outset of a program  the contract is usually only partially funded and congress must annually determine if additional funds will be appropriated to the program 
as a result  long term contracts are subject to cancellation if appropriations for future periods become unavailable 
we have not historically experienced any significant material adverse effects as a result of the government s failure to fund programs awarded to us 
if the government were to terminate some or all of our contracts or reduce appropriations  cancel appropriations or both to a program we have a contract with  our operating performance and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the limited ability of legal protections to safeguard our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to compete effectively 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of confidentiality procedures  contractual provisions  patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  particularly in certain foreign countries  including  among others  the peoples republic of china 
we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop technology similar to ours 
our products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 
the number of intellectual property claims in our industry may increase as the number of competing products grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
in recent years  there has been a tendency by software companies to file substantially increasing numbers of patent applications  including those for business methods and processes 
we have no way of knowing what patent applications third parties have filed until the application is published or until a patent is issued 
patent applications are often published within months of filing  but it can take as long as three years or more for a patent to be granted after an application has been filed 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to address  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
these royalty or license agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance 
our international operations pose risks for our business and financial condition 
we currently conduct operations in australia  belgium  brazil  canada  france  germany  hong kong  japan  malaysia  mexico  taiwan  the netherlands  the peoples republic of china  singapore  sweden and the united kingdom and we also have a relationship with a third party in india to outsource a portion of our product development effort 
we intend to expand our international operations and to increase the proportion of our revenue from outside the us these operations require significant management attention and financial resources and additionally subject us to risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as failure to properly comply with foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign activities  failure to properly comply with us laws and regulations relating to the export of our products and services  difficulties in managing foreign operations and appropriate levels of staffing  longer collection cycles  tariffs and other trade barriers  seasonal reductions in business activities  particularly throughout europe  proper compliance with local tax laws which can be complex and may result in unintended adverse tax consequences  and increasing political instability  adverse economic conditions and the potential for war or other hostilities in many of these countries 
our failure to properly comply or address any of the above factors could adversely affect the success of our international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
our continued shift of a significant number of our contractors to our product development operations in india poses significant risks 
we have a relationship with a third party to outsource a portion of our product development effort 
we have continued to increase the proportion of our product development work being performed by contractors to india in order to take advantage of cost efficiencies associated with india s lower wage scale 
however  we may not achieve the cost savings and other benefits we anticipate from this program and we may not be able to find sufficient numbers of developers with the necessary skill sets in india to meet our needs 
we have a heightened risk exposure to changes in the economic  security and political conditions of india 
economic and political instability  military actions and other unforeseen occurrences in india could impair our ability to develop and introduce new software applications and functionality in a timely manner  which could put our products at a competitive disadvantage whereby we lose existing customers and fail to attract new customers 
changes in the value of the us dollar  in relation to the currencies of foreign countries where we transact business  could harm our operating performance and financial condition 
during fiscal  of our total revenue was derived from outside the united states 
our primary international operations are located throughout europe and asia pacific 
we also have operations in brazil  canada and mexico 
our international revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  typically the local currency of the selling business unit 
therefore  changes in the value of the us dollar as compared to these other currencies may adversely affect our operating results 
we intend to expand our international operations and to increase the proportion of our revenue from outside the us for example  we recently opened offices in malaysia and the peoples republic of china 
we expect to use an increasing number of foreign currencies  causing our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations to increase 
we generally do not implement hedging programs to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations affecting international accounts receivable  cash balances and intercompany accounts  and we do not hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations affecting future international revenues and expenses and other commitments 
for the foregoing reasons  currency exchange rate fluctuations have caused  and likely will continue to cause  variability in our foreign currency denominated revenue streams and our cost to settle foreign currency denominated liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
we may be subject to future liability claims  and the reputations of our company and products may suffer 
many of our implementations involve projects that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify 
any failure in a client s system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure 
we have entered into and plan to continue to enter into agreements with software vendors  consulting firms  resellers and others whereby they market our solutions 
if these vendors fail to meet their clients expectations or cause failures in their clients systems  our reputation and products could be materially and adversely affected even if our software products perform in accordance with their functional specifications 
if requirements relating to accounting treatment for employee stock options are changed  we may be forced to change our business practices 
we currently account for the issuance of stock options under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
if proposals currently under consideration by accounting standards organizations and governmental authorities are adopted  we may be required to treat the value of the stock options granted to employees as a compensation expense 
as a result  we could decide to reduce the number of stock options granted to employees or to grant options to fewer employees 
this could affect our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates  and increase the cash compensation or benefits we would have to pay to them 
in addition  such a change could have a material effect on our operating performance 
it may become increasingly expensive to obtain and maintain insurance 
we obtain insurance to cover a variety of potential risks and liabilities 
in the current market  insurance coverage is becoming more restrictive and when insurance coverage is offered  the deductible for which we are responsible is larger and premiums have increased substantially 
as a result  it may become more difficult to maintain insurance coverage at historical levels  or if such coverage is available  the cost to obtain or maintain it may increase substantially 
this may result in our being forced to bear the burden of an increased portion of risks for which we have traditionally been covered by insurance  which could have a material effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
risks related to our industry our future growth is substantially dependent on the continued success of the internet as a reliable and secure commercial medium 
the failure of the internet as a reliable and secure commercial medium would have a material adverse effect on our operating performance and financial condition 
the growth of the internet increased demand for our solutions  as well as created markets for new and enhanced product offerings 
therefore  our future sales and financial performance are substantially dependent upon the internet as a reliable and secure commercial medium 
the continued success of the internet as a reliable and secure commercial medium may be adversely affected for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of network infrastructure  delayed development of enabling technologies  performance improvements and security measures  sustained disruptions in the accessibility  security and reliability  delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  increased taxation and governmental regulation  or changes in  or insufficient availability of  communications services to support the internet  resulting in slower internet user response times 
the occurrence of any of these factors could require us to modify our technology and our business strategy 
we have expended significant amounts of resources to develop and deploy our products using the internet as a medium 
any such modifications could require us to expend significant additional amounts of resources 
in the event that the internet does not remain a viable and secure commercial medium  our operating performance and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
new laws or regulations affecting the internet or commerce in general could reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our growth 
congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have adopted and are considering legislation affecting the use of the internet  including laws relating to the use of the internet for commerce and distribution 
the adoption or interpretation of laws regulating the internet  or of existing laws governing such things as taxation of commerce  consumer protection  libel  property rights and personal privacy  could adversely affect its use as a communications and commercial medium 
if this occurs  companies may decide not to use our products or services  and our operating performance and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
risks related to our common stock our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
we have recently experienced significant declines in our stock price due to our poor financial performance 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile 
our stock price has been and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results and continuing losses  continued or deteriorating adverse economic  political and market conditions  announcements of technological innovations  new products or services offered by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts  changes in the performance  market valuations  or both  of our current and potential competitors and the software industry in general  our announcement or a competitors announcement of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  adoption of industry standards and the inclusion of our technology in  or compatibility of our technology with  such standards  adverse or unfavorable publicity regarding us  or our products and services or implementations  adverse or unfavorable publicity regarding our competitors  including their products and implementations  additions or departures of key personnel  sales or anticipated sales of additional debt or equity securities  and other events or factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  the nasdaq national market and the equity markets for software companies in particular  have experienced extraordinary price and volume volatility in recent years 
such volatility has adversely affected the stock prices for many companies irrespective of  or disproportionately to  the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely further affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
our charter and bylaws  delaware law and indenture for the notes contain provisions that could discourage a takeover even if beneficial to stockholders 
our charter and our bylaws  in conjunction with delaware law  contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us even if doing so would be beneficial to stockholders 
for example  our bylaws provide for a classified board of directors and allow our board of directors to expand its size and fill any vacancies without stockholder approval 
furthermore  our board has the authority to issue preferred stock and to designate the voting rights  dividend rate and privileges of the preferred stock  all of which may be greater than the rights of common stockholders 
additionally  upon a change of control of the company  the holders of the notes would have the right to require us or our successor to repurchase the notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase in cash 
this could make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us even if doing so would be beneficial to stockholders

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 
foreign currency risk 
we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries which use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
such changes could result in cumulative translation gains or losses that are included in shareholders equity 
revenue outside of the united states was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue outside the united states is derived from operations in australia  belgium  brazil  canada  china  france  germany  hong kong  italy  japan  malaysia  mexico  netherlands  singapore  sweden  taiwan and the united kingdom 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies of these countries result in positive or negative fluctuations in the amounts relating to foreign operations reported in our consolidated financial statements 
none of the components of our financial statements were materially affected by exchange rate fluctuations during fiscal  and we generally do not use foreign currency options and forward contracts to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
while we do not expect to incur material losses as a result of this currency risk  there can be no assurance that losses will not result 
interest rate risk 
our marketable securities and certain cash equivalents are subject to interest rate risk 
we manage this risk by maintaining an investment portfolio of available for sale instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
these instruments include  but are not limited to  commercial paper  money market instruments  bank time deposits and variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations and national  state and local governments and agencies  in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
the fair market value of marketable securities held was million and million at february  and february   respectively 
we also hold cash balances in accounts with commercial banks in the united states and foreign countries 
these cash balances represent operating balances only and are invested in short term deposits of the local bank 
such operating cash balances held at banks outside of the united states are denominated in the local currency 
the united states federal reserve board influences the general market rates of interest 
during calendar  the federal reserve board decreased the federal funds rate several times  by basis points  to 
during fiscal  the federal funds rate was further reduced by basis points to 
these actions have led to a general market decline in interest rates 
the weighted average yield on interest bearing investments held as of february  and was approximately and  respectively 
based on our investment holdings at february   a basis point decline in the average yield would reduce our annual interest income by million 
credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities and trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments to investment grade securities and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses 
we do not require collateral or other security to support clients receivables since most of our customers are large  well established companies 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified both by geography and industry and no single customer accounts for more than our consolidated revenue 
we generally do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
