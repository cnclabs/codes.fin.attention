item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is based upon our financial statements as of the dates and for the periods presented in this section 
you should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary data and notes thereto found in item 
table of contents safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements in this form k that relate to future plans  events  expectations  objectives or performance or assumptions underlying such matters are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include  among other things  statements that relate to west marine s future plans  expectations  objectives  performance and similar projections  as well as facts and assumptions underlying these statements or projections 
actual results may differ materially from the results expressed or implied in these forward looking statements due to various risks  uncertainties or other factors 
set forth below are certain important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
because consumers often consider boats to be luxury items  the market is subject to changes in consumer confidence and spending habits 
recent slowing of the domestic economy may adversely affect sales volumes  as well as our ability to maintain current gross profit levels 
our operations could be adversely affected if unseasonably cold weather  prolonged winter conditions or extraordinary amounts of rainfall were to occur during the peak boating season in the second and third quarters 
our catalog division has faced market share erosion in areas where either we or our competitors have opened stores 
management expects this trend to continue 
our growth has been fueled principally by our stores operations 
our continued growth depends to a significant degree on our ability to continue to expand our operations through the opening and profitable operation of new stores  as well as our ability to increase net sales at our existing stores 
our planned expansion is subject to a number of factors  including the adequacy of our capital resources  our ability to locate suitable store sites and negotiate acceptable lease terms  to hire  train and integrate employees and to adapt our distribution and other operations systems 
the markets for recreational water sports and boating supplies are highly competitive 
competitive pressures resulting from competitors pricing policies are expected to continue 
our efforts to integrate the acquired boat america operations with our own will involve a number of risks  including unanticipated costs and difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of boat america into our operations  the potential diversion of our management from west marine s ongoing business objectives  the loss of key boat america employees who choose not to be employed by west marine and a decline in the economy that could threaten the economic assumptions of the transaction 
additional factors which may affect our financial results include inventory management issues  the impact of the internet and e commerce on the supply chain  fluctuations in consumer spending on recreational boating supplies  environmental regulations  demand for and acceptance of our products and other risk factors disclosed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of west marine s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this form k 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 

table of contents merchandise inventory 
our merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
inventory cost includes certain indirect costs related to the purchasing  transportation and warehousing of merchandise 
we make certain assumptions to adjust inventory based on historical experience and current information in order to assess that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as store closures  indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
at the time a decision is made to close a store  we record an impairment charge  if appropriate  and accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income  state tax apportionment and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement components expressed as a percent of net sales net sales cost of goods sold including buying and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to in  west marine had net sales of million  an increase of million  or  over net sales of million in net income of million  or per diluted share  in compares to net income of million  or per diluted share  in net sales attributable to our stores division increased million  or  to million in  mostly due to the addition of new stores  which contributed million to net sales growth

liquidity and capital resources operating activities during  our primary source of liquidity was cash flows from operations and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by operations during was million  consisting primarily of net income  excluding depreciation and amortization  of million and a million increase in accounts payable  offset by a million increase in inventory and a million increase in prepaid expenses 
the inventory increase reflects the increase in the number of stores  as well as our commitment to increasing fill rates  which enhance sales  as well as advanced stocking of merchandise at stores in preparation for the peak boating season 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  primarily million received from the exercise of stock options and the net sales of common stock pursuant to the associate stock purchase plan  offset by million in repayments of our long term debt and million in repayments on a line of credit 
capital growth west marine s primary cash requirements are related to capital expenditures for new stores and remodeling existing stores  including leasehold improvement costs  fixtures and information systems enhancements  and for merchandise inventory for stores 
in  we spent million on capital expenditures 
in january  we acquired the retail stores  catalog and wholesale operations of boat america for million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
we expect to spend from million to million on other capital expenditures during  mainly for new stores 
we intend to pay for our expansion through cash generated from operations and bank borrowings 

table of contents finance arrangements at the end of  we had outstanding a million senior guarantee note maturing on december   and requiring annual principal payments of million 
the note bore interest at  was unsecured and contained certain restrictive covenants including fixed charge coverage  debt to capitalization ratios and minimum net worth requirements 
this note was repaid in january at the end of  we had a million credit line and borrowings under that credit line were million  bearing interest at rates ranging from to 
on january   we replaced the million credit line with a million credit line  which expires in three years 
the new credit line is guaranteed by west marine and its subsidiaries and is secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of west marine and its subsidiaries 
we immediately borrowed million under the new facility and used million to acquire certain operations from boat america  million to repay our old credit line  million to repay the senior guarantee note which amount included a million make whole fee incurred because the senior note carried interest at a higher rate than interest rates prevailing at the time of the repayment and million for bank fees related to the new credit facility 
the new credit line includes a million sub facility for standby and commercial letters of credit  of which up to million is available for the issuance of commercial letters of credit and up to million is available for standby letters of credit 
the new credit line also includes a sub limit of up to million for same day advances 
on june   the credit facility will permanently reduce to million 
at the end of  borrowings under a previous credit line were million  bearing interest at rates ranging from to 
depending on our election at the time of borrowing  the new line bears interest at either a the higher of i the bank s prime rate plus or ii the federal funds rate plus or b libor plus 
upon receipt by the bank of our financial statements for the second quarter of  these rates may be adjusted based upon our ratio of cash flow to debt for the period 
the new credit line contains various covenants which require us to maintain certain financial ratios  including debt service coverage  debt to earnings and current ratios 
the covenants also require us to maintain minimum levels of net worth and place limitations on the levels of certain investments 
these covenants also restrict the repurchase or redemption of our common stock and payment of dividends  investments in subsidiaries and annual capital expenditures 
at the end of  we had million of outstanding stand by letters of credit  compared to million at year end at the end of and  we had million and million  respectively  of outstanding commercial letters of credit 
during and  the weighted average interest rate on all outstanding borrowings was and  respectively 
contractual obligations aggregated information about the company s contractual obligations as of december  is presented in the following table in thousands 
total after years contractual cash obligations long term debt operating leases total cash contractual obligations operating leases are the only financing arrangements not reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe existing credit facilities and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs through seasonality historically  our business has been highly seasonal 
in  of our net sales and all of our net income occurred during the second and third quarters  principally during the period from april through july  which represents the peak months for boat buying  usage and maintenance in most of our markets 
management expects the seasonal fluctuation in net sales to become more pronounced as we continue to expand our operations 
business trends west marine s growth in net sales has been principally fueled by geographic expansion through the opening of new stores and  to a lesser extent  by comparable stores net sales increases 
future net sales and profit growth  if any  will be increasingly dependent on the opening and profitability of new stores 
our catalog division continues to face market share erosion in markets where either we or our competitors have opened new stores 
management expects this trend to continue 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk  and west marine is not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
a basis point change in interest rate of our weighted average interest rate affecting our floating financial instruments would have an effect of approximately million on our pretax income and cash flows over the next year  and would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of our fixed rate financial instruments see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in
