the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to this restatement 
introduction we are a seller of spoken audio and nostalgia products  including audiobooks and old time radio shows  through direct response  retail and internet channels 
our content and products are sold in multiple formats  including physical cassette and compact disc and secure digital download formats 
we report financial results on the basis of four business segments  corporate  audio book club abc  radio spirits radio spirits or rsi and mediabay 
com 
a fifth division  radio classics  is aggregated with radio spirits for financial reporting purposes 
except for corporate  each segment serves a unique market segment within the spoken word audio industry 
in  our audio book club segment had net sales of approximately million  our radio spirits segment had net sales of approximately million  our mediabay 
com segment had sales of approximately million and we had eliminating inter segment sales of million 
in the third quarter of  we began to implement a series of actions and decisions designed to improve gross profit margin  refine our marketing efforts and reduce general and administrative costs 
specifically  we i reduced the number of items offered for sale at both its radio spirits and audio book club subsidiaries  ii moved fulfillment of our old time radio products to a third party fulfillment provider  iii limited our investment and marketing efforts in downloadable audio due to lack of customer acceptance at this time  and the limited number and high price point of digital audio download players currently produced and iv refined our marketing of old time radio products and our marketing efforts to existing audio book club members 
in connection with the movement of the fulfillment of old time radio products to a third party provider  in the first quarter of  we closed our old time radio operations in schaumburg  illinois and now run all of our operations  except for fulfillment  from our corporate headquarters located in cedar knolls  new jersey 
in the third quarter of  as a result of the actions and decisions made after our aforementioned review of our operations  we recorded million of write downs and strategic charges  as described below 
in addition to these strategic charges  we recorded a charge of million to write off the entire carrying amount of our cost method investment in i jam 
during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed long lived assets and certain related identifiable intangibles  including goodwill  for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas due to a change in facts and circumstances 
we determined that the revised estimates of cash flows from certain of our acquired operations would no longer be sufficient to recover the carrying value of goodwill associated with these businesses 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the goodwill associated with these businesses was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million 
the impairment charge was measured as the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its fair value  which was based upon discounted cash flows 
as a result of the series of strategic initiatives  described above  our operations have improved 
although realization of net deferred tax assets is not assured  we have determined  based on our improved operations  that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements will be realized in future periods 
accordingly  in we reduced the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the amount of million and recorded an income tax benefit 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reviewed the carrying amounts of its intangible assets and determined  based on decisions made in the fourth quarter of  that the value of certain intangible assets could no longer be supported by anticipated future operations 
specifically  the company made a strategic decision to no longer compete in the dvd market and accordingly wrote off the value of certain video and dvd rights it had acquired in the amount of the company made the decision in the fourth quarter of to no longer pursue other companies  which may be infringing on the freeny patent and accordingly began discussions with e data regarding a re negotiation of the agreement between the two parties 
on april   the parties concluded their negotiations and the company will be returning certain acquired rights to e data in return for  shares of mediabay common stock provided to e data in the original transaction 
because the decision not to pursue possible infringers was made in and the discussions with e data commenced in  the company has written off the unamortized carrying value of the e data license  less the market value of the  shares of mediabay common stock to be returned to mediabay  which has been recorded as a receivable due from e data to the company 
the company has recorded a write off of  in the company also made the strategic decision in the fourth quarter of to discontinue future mailings to the columbia house lists of members of other clubs  which could not support the carrying value of the columbia house mailing agreement 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  the company wrote off the remaining value of the columbia house mailing agreement of as a result of the recording of the goodwill write off  the strategic charges  the write off of intangibles and the income tax benefit  as well as fluctuations in operating results depending on the timing  magnitude and success of audio book club new member advertising campaigns  comparisons of our historical operating results from year to year may not be meaningful 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  the carrying value and net realizable value of inventories  the recoverability of advances to publishers and other rightsholders  the future revenue associated with deferred advertising and promotion costs  investments  fixed assets  the valuation allowance provided to reduce our deferred tax assets and valuation of goodwill and other intangibles 
the securities and exchange commission sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however the following policies are considered to be critical within the sec definition revenue recognition the company derives its principal revenue through sales of audiobooks  classic radio shows and other spoken word audio products directly to consumers principally through direct mail 
the company also sells classic radio shows to retailers either directly or through distributors 
the company derives additional revenue through rental of its proprietary database of names and addresses to non competing third parties through list rental brokers 
the company also derives a small amount of revenue from advertisers included in its nationally syndicated classic radio shows 
the company recognizes sales to consumers  retailers and distributors upon shipment of merchandise 
list rental revenue is recognized on notification by the list brokers of rental by a third party when the lists are rented 
the company recognizes advertising revenue upon notification of the airing of the advertisement by the media buying company representing the company 
allowances for future returns are based upon historical experience and evaluation of current trends 
we record reductions to our revenue for future returns and record an estimate of future bad debts arising from current sales in general and administrative expenses 
these allowances are based upon historical experience and evaluation of current trends 
if members and customers return products to us in the future at higher rates than in the past or than we currently anticipate  our net sales would be reduced and our operating results would be adversely affected 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  which addresses the income statement classification of certain credits  allowances  adjustments  and payments given to customers for the services or benefits provided 
the company adopted eitf no 
effective january   and  as such  has classified the cost of these sales incentives as a reduction of sales 
the effect on sales of applying eitf no 
in was  deferred member acquisition costs we are required to capitalize direct response marketing costs for the acquisition of new members in accordance with aicpa statement of position reporting on advertising costs and amortize these costs over the period of probable future benefits 
in order to determine the amount of advertising to be capitalized and the manner and period over which the advertising should be amortized  we prepare estimates of probable future revenues arising from the direct response advertising in excess of future costs to be incurred in realizing those revenues 
if future revenue does not meet our estimates or if members buying patterns were to shift  adjustments to the amount and manner of amortization would be required 
at december  we had deferred member acquisition costs of million  which is being amortized over the next thirty months 
accounts receivable valuation we record an estimate of our anticipated bad debt expense based on our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers  including either individual consumers or retail chains  were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payment to us  additional allowances would be required 
for example  a one percent increase in returns as a percentage of gross sales for the year ended  assuming a constant gross profit percentage and all other expenses unchanged  would have resulted in a decrease in net sales of  and a increase in net loss available to common shares of  a one percent increase in bad debt expenses as a percentage of net sales  assuming all other expenses were unchanged  would have resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses and a corresponding increase in net loss available to common shares of  income taxes the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary timing differences become deductible 
as a result of a series of strategic initiatives  our operations have improved 
although realization of net deferred tax assets is not assured  management has determined  based on the company s improved operations  that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements will be realized in future periods 
at december   we have recorded a deferred tax asset in the amount of million 
should we determine we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to our deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that an intangible asset that is acquired shall be initially recognized and measured based on its fair value 
the statement also provides that goodwill should not be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
at december   we had million of goodwill  all of which relates to our radio spirits operations 
the company completed its initial transitional impairment test as of january  and its annual impairment test as of october  in connection with the annual budgeting and planning process  which did not result in an impairment loss 
however  if conditions or circumstances were to change resulting in a deterioration of our radio spirits business  a future impairment of goodwill could be necessary 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  historical operating data as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  sales cost of sales cost of sales write downs advertising and promotion advertising and promotion write downs general and administrative expense asset write downs and strategic charges depreciation and amortization expense non cash write down of intangibles non cash write down of goodwill interest expense  net income tax expenses benefit extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt net loss dividends on preferred stock net loss applicable to common shares year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales for the year ended december  increased million or to as compared to million for the year ended december  audio book club increased sales by million  principally due to an increase in club membership as a result of the company s marketing efforts to grow the business 
for the year ended december   the audio book club attracted approximately  members as compared to approximately  members who joined the audio book club during the year ended december  the increase in radio spirits sales  of million  is principally attributable to sales of the world s greatest old time radio continuity program  a marketing program introduced in  which is similar to our audio book club and offers old time radio products 
cost of sales for the year ended december  was million 
cost of sales for the year ended december  was million  of which million represented a charge for the write down of inventory in the third quarter of gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  was  compared to for excluding the write down of inventory in the third quarter of  gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit is principally due to reduced product costs at both audio book club and radio spirits 
the reduction in product costs is due to better buying  combined purchasing at both audio book club and radio spirits and revisions in the mix of products and packaging at both audio book club and radio spirits 
advertising and promotion expenses for the year ended december  were million 
advertising and promotion expenses for the year ended december  were million of which  million represented write downs to deferred member acquisition costs 
the decrease in reported advertising costs is principally due to lower expenditures relating to audio book club new member acquisitions in as compared to and the write down of deferred member acquisition costs in the third quarter of which resulted in lower amortization of new member acquisition costs in and thus lower reported advertising expense in general and administrative expenses decreased 
million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior comparable period 
general and administrative expense decreases are principally attributable to reductions at radio spirits partially offset by an increase in bad debt expenses 
bad debt expenses increased 
million attendant with an increase in net sales at audio book club 
bad debt expense as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  in february  we moved our radio spirits operation from schaumburg  illinois to our corporate and audio book club offices in cedar knolls  new jersey 
in addition to giving us greater control over the operations  general and administrative expenses  other than bad debt expense  for our radio spirits division for the year ended december  declined by 
million as compared to the year ended december  at radio spirits  for the year ended december   we reduced payroll and related costs by 
million  office expenses by 
million  telephone expenses by 
million and legal fees by 
million as compared to the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is principally attributable to the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets in and  to a lesser extent  certain intangible assets were fully amortized in sfas no 
requires that an intangible asset that is acquired shall be initially recognized and measured based on its fair value 
the statement also provides that goodwill should not be amortized  but shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
existing goodwill continued to be amortized through the year ended december  at which time amortization ceased 
the amount of goodwill amortized during the year ended december  was 
million 
based on our review for goodwill impairment in  the company did not recognize any goodwill impairment in in accordance with sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reviewed the carrying amounts of its intangible assets and determined  based on decisions made in the fourth quarter of  that the value of certain intangible assets could no longer be supported by anticipated future operations 
specifically  the company made a strategic decision to no longer compete in the dvd market and accordingly wrote off the value of certain video and dvd rights it had acquired in the amount of  the company also made the strategic decision in the fourth quarter of to discontinue future mailings to the columbia house lists of members of other clubs 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  the company wrote off the unamortized value of the columbia house mailing agreement of interest expense for the year ended december  was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  included in interest expense is the amortization of debt discount resulting from the issuance of warrants and beneficial conversion features related to certain of our financings 
the amount amortized was 
million and 
million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net loss before income taxes for the year ended december  was million as compared to a net loss before income taxes for the year ended december  of million 
as a result of the series of strategic initiatives described above  our operations have improved 
although realization of net deferred tax assets is not assured  we determined in  based on our improved operations  that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements will be realized in future periods 
accordingly we reduced the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the amount of million and recorded an income tax benefit 
during then year ended december   we utilized  of the million deferred tax asset recorded in accordingly  we recorded an income tax expense of  the company accrued preferred stock dividends of million on the outstanding  shares of series a preferred stock  which were issued in january net loss applicable to common shares for the year ended december  was million  or 
per diluted share of common stock as compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share of common stock for the year ended december  year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in sales is primarily attributable to more focused marketing at audio book club to concentrate on more profitable new members and non recurring i jam marketing revenue we recorded in cost of sales for the year ended december  was million  of which million represented a charge for the write down of inventory in the third quarter of excluding the write down  cost of sales for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales  is principally due to revisions in the merchandising of our products  including increases in our selling prices and selection of products  which contribute greater gross profit 
as a result  gross profit as a percentage of net sales  excluding the write down  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  advertising and promotion expenses for the year ended december  was million of which  million represented write downs to deferred member acquisition costs as described below 
excluding the write downs  advertising and promotion expenses increased million or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  actual amounts incurred for advertising and promotion  net of settlements with certain vendors principally for unprofitable internet marketing campaigns  for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  from the amount incurred in the year ended december  of million 
the difference between the amount expended and the amount recorded as expense is due to amortization of previously capitalized direct response advertising costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior comparable period 
general and administrative expense decreases are principally attributable to decreases in bad debt expenses of million commensurate with the reduction in net sales  payroll and related costs due to previously announced staff reductions and the inclusion in of non cash compensation expenses related to contingent warrants issued in of million  office expenses of million  telephone costs related to a reduction in service calls of million  travel costs of million  public relations costs of million and consulting services principally relating to internet maintenance and development of million 
included in general and administrative expenses in were million of non cash compensation expense relating to contingent warrants issued in we also benefited from settlements with certain vendors in as a result of the actions and decisions made after our aforementioned review of our operations  we recorded million of strategic charges in these charges include the following o million of inventory written down to net realizable value due to a reduction in the number of stock keeping units sku s  o million of write downs of deferred member acquisition costs at audio book club related to new member acquisition campaigns that have been determined to be no longer profitable and recoverable through future operations based upon historical performance and future projections  o million of write downs to royalty advances paid to audiobook publishers and other license holders primarily associated with inventory titles that will no longer be carried and sold to members  o million of write downs to deferred member acquisition costs at radio spirits related to old time radio new customer acquisition campaigns that have been determined to be no longer profitable and recoverable through future operations based upon historical performance and future projections  o a write down of million of customer lists acquired in the columbia house audiobook club purchase due to the inability to recover this asset through future operations  o million of fixed assets of the old time radio operations written down to net realizable value due to the closing of the schaumburg  illinois facility  o million of write downs of royalty advances paid for downloadable licensing rights that are no longer recoverable due to the strategic decisions made  o million of write downs of prepaid assets  o million of write offs to receivables that are deemed uncollectible  o million of net write offs of capitalized website development costs related to downloadable audio all of which are no longer recoverable due to the strategic changes in the business  and o million accrued for lease termination costs in connection with the closing of the schaumburg  illinois facility 
of these charges  million related to inventory write downs has been recorded to costs of sales strategic charges  million has been recorded to advertising and promotion write downs and the remaining million has been recorded to asset write downs and strategic charges 
in addition to these strategic charges  we have recorded a charge of million to write off the entire carrying amount of our investment in i jam 
this charge has been recorded to asset write downs and strategic charges 
we have determined that an other than temporary decline in the value of this investment has occurred  triggered by a strategic change in the direction of the investee as a result of continued losses and operating deficiencies  along with projected future losses 
during the year ended december   the company recorded the following activity in its accrual for shutdown expenses related to the move from illinois to new jersey beginning balance  january  employee related costs lease termination costs balance accrued at december  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease is principally attributable to the write down of goodwill taken in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed long lived assets and certain related identifiable intangibles  including goodwill  for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas due to a change in facts and circumstances 
in the fourth quarter of  we made a strategic decision to reduce spending on marketing to customers acquired in the acquisitions of the columbia house audiobook club  doubleday direct s audiobooks direct and adventures in cassettes in order to focus its resources on more profitable revenue sources 
in addition  we sold the remaining inventory acquired in its acquisition of adventures in cassettes and do not expect to derive any future revenues associated with this business 
consequently  we determined that the revised estimates of cash flows from such operations would no longer be sufficient to recover the carrying value of goodwill associated with these businesses 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the goodwill associated with these businesses was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million 
the impairment charge was measured as the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its fair value  which was based upon discounted cash flows 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million to million as compared to net interest expense of million for the year ended december  the reduction in interest expense is due to a lower average outstanding principal balance on our debt  as well as lower interest rates on the portion of our debt  which has adjustable interest rates 
included in interest expense is the amortization of debt discount resulting from the issuance of warrants and beneficial conversion features related to certain of our financings 
the amount amortized was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net loss before income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million as compared to a net loss before income taxes and an extraordinary item in of million for the year ended december  as a result of the series of strategic initiatives described above  our operations have improved 
although realization of net deferred tax assets is not assured  we have determined  based on our improved operations  that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements will be realized in future periods 
accordingly we reduced the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in the amount of million and recorded an income tax benefit 
in april  we repaid million of our bank debt out of the net proceeds from our follow on primary offering 
accordingly  the company recorded an extraordinary loss of million relating to the write off of deferred financing fees incurred in connection with such debt 
due  in part  to the reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets offset by the strategic charges enumerated above  we had a net loss of million  or per diluted share of common stock for the year ended december   as compared to a net loss of million or per diluted share of common stock for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our cash requirements through sales of our equity and debt securities and borrowings from financial institutions and our principal shareholders 
we have implemented a series of initiatives to increase cash flow 
while these initiatives have successfully increased cash provided by operating activities in  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing to repay debt or fund the expansion of operations  acquisitions  working capital or other related uses 
management believes that additional sources of capital are available if required 
for the year ended december   our cash increased by 
million  as we had cash provided by operating and financing activities of million and million  respectively  and we had cash used in investing activities of million 
net cash provided by operating activities principally consisted of our net loss applicable to common shares of million  decreased by depreciation and amortization expenses of million  amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount of million  utilization of our deferred tax asset resulting in an income tax expense of  non current accrued interest and dividends payable million  decreases in prepaid expenses of million and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
net cash provided by operations was reduced by increases in accounts receivable of million  inventories of million  royalty advances of million and a net increase in deferred member acquisition costs of million 
the decrease in prepaid expenses was principally the result of the timing of direct mail campaigns in our audio book club business 
in  we incurred certain costs for a january campaign in december in  we mailed our campaign in december and not in january the increase in accounts payable was principally due to increased advertising expenditures as well as increases in fulfillment costs and inventory purchases as sales increased 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to higher net sales  principally at our audio book club 
the increase in inventories is principally due to the expansion of wholesale sales at radio spirits requiring the maintenance of greater inventory 
the increase in deferred member acquisition cost is principally due to the expansion of our direct mail and internet advertising activities to attract new members to audio book club 
cash used in investing activities was for the acquisition of fixed assets and the acquisition of the assets used by great american audio in their old time radio business including the license to the shadow programs and the cash paid in connection with the acquisition of an exclusive field of use license license to us  canadian and european patents in the spoken audio  e book and print on demand markets from e data corporation 
in the fourth quarter of  the company made a strategic decision to no longer pursue other companies which may be infringing on the freeny patent and accordingly impaired the value of this asset 
the company has reduced the carrying value of the asset to its net realizable value based upon the value of  shares of the company s common stock to be returned by e data to the company 
accordingly  the company has recognized a charge included in non cash write down of intangibles of  during the year ended december   we repaid million under our senior credit facility 
on january   evan herrick  the son of norton herrick  our chairman  a brother of howard herrick an executive vice president and director and the brother of michael herrick  a director  exchanged million principal amount of a million principal amount convertible note of mediabay  inc in exchange for  shares of series a preferred stock of mediabay  having a liquidation preference of million 
the preferred share dividend rate of per share is the same as the interest rate of the note  and is payable in additional preferred shares  shares of common stock of mediabay or cash  at the holder s option  provided that if the holder elects to receive payment in cash  the payment will accrue until mediabay is permitted to make the payment under its existing credit facility
