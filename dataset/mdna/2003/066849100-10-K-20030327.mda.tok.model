critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition are based on the consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses and review of goodwill for impairment  on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is a significant accounting estimate used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses  which is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses  is based on management s evaluation of the level of allowance required in relation to the probable loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
management regularly evaluates the allowance for loan losses for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as previous loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic and real estate market conditions and the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms and estimated fair values of properties to be foreclosed 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 
refer to the discussion of credit risk in the risk management section and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of management s estimation process and methodology related to the reserve for loan losses 
management utilizes numerous techniques to estimate the value of various assets held by the company 
management utilized various methods to determine the appropriate carrying value of goodwill as required under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
at december   the carrying value of goodwill amounted to goodwill from a purchase acquisition is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment using several standard valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses  as well as an estimation of the impact of business conditions 
different estimates or assumptions are also utilized to determine the appropriate carrying value of other assets including  but not limited to  premises and equipment  mortgage servicing rights  and overall collectibility of loans and receivables 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different estimates of carrying value

other operating income and expenses in addition to net interest income  non interest income is a significant source of revenue for the company and an important factor in its results of operations 
likewise  non interest expense represents a significant category of expense for the company  second only to interest expense 
for the year ended december   total non interest income amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing a decrease of  or  and an increase of  or  respectively 
for the year ended december   total non interest expense amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing a decrease of and an increase of  or and  respectively 
as more fully disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company manages and operates two major lines of business community banking and financial services 
the following discussion and analysis of other operating income and expenses focuses on each business segment separately community banking years ended december    and non interest income non interest expense non interest income non interest income from community banking represented of the company s total non interest income  compared with and in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the bank s total non interest income amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing an increase of and a decrease of  or and  respectively 
the increase in non interest income was attributed to in net gains on the sale of investment securities  compared with none during changes in market interest rates during presented attractive opportunities to reposition a relatively small portion of the bank s investment securities portfolio 
there is no assurance that the recording of securities gains will continue in future reporting periods at levels 
it is important to note  however  that the available for sale investment securities portfolio is managed on a total return basis  in concert with well structured asset liability management policies 
the bank will continue to respond to changes in market interest rates  changes in securities pre payment or extension risk  changes in the availability of and yields on alternative investments  and its needs for liquidity 
offsetting the increase in income from securities gains was a  or  decline in service charges on deposit accounts compared with in december of the bank implemented various product and service fee enhancements and improved its management over fee waivers 
these actions substantially improved non interest income during the first half of however  as was generally anticipated  the initial impact on fee income was not fully sustained in the months following implementation  as many low balance accounts were either consolidated or closed  and certain customer habits  including overdraft activity  showed substantial change 
led by a decline in mortgage loan servicing fees  other fee income also declined in  decreasing from levels 
included in the bank s non interest income is  representing the gain on the sale of the bank s trust business to its affiliate  bti financial group 
as depicted in note to the financial statements  this non interest income is eliminated in the consolidation of the company s financial statements 
excluding this one time event from the results  the bank s non interest income increased  or 
the improvement in the bank s non interest income was principally attributed to product and service fee enhancements implemented in late  and improved management of customer service charges 
non interest expense non interest expense from community banking represented of the company s total non interest expense  compared with and in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the bank s total non interest expense amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing increases of and  or and  respectively 
the increase in non interest expense was principally attributed to employee compensation increases  increases in subsidized employee health insurance  deferred executive compensation  and certain additions to the bank s workforce 
the year over year increase in salaries and employee benefits amounted to  or 
charitable contributions during were also higher than levels  increasing to a total of  or of the bank total pre tax income 
salaries and employee benefit expenses accounted for a substantial portion of the increase in non interest expenses compared with  and were principally attributed to staff additions in customer service  credit administration  and operational areas of the bank 
also contributing to the increase in non interest expense was the software depreciation resulting from the conversion of all core applications to a new and improved integrated platform during and the implementation of on line  real time internet banking applications in early financial services years ended december    and non interest income non interest expense non interest income non interest income from financial services bti financial group represented of the company s total non interest income  compared with and in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   total non interest income at bti amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing a decrease of  and an increase of  or and  respectively 
included in non interest income is an adjustment of representing a full accrual of fee income 
excluding this adjustment  total non interest income decreased or compared with the decline in non interest income was principally attributed to a significant decline in the market value of assets under management at block capital management block and bar harbor trust services trust 
fees charged to clients are derived principally from the market values of assets managed 
at december   assets under management totaled  compared with  and  at december  and  representing declines of  and  or and  respectively 
the two year decline in managed assets was principally attributed to the significant declines in the stock market over this same period 
the decline in managed assets was also attributed to lost business  as investor confidence has been seriously eroded by depressed securities markets  corporate scandals  troubled economies both here and abroad  and overall geo political tensions and uncertainties 
for the year ended december   total revenue at block and trust amounted to  compared with  in  and  in  representing a decrease of  or  and an increase of or  respectively 
restrained investor confidence  particularly in the retail brokerage sector  also impacted performance at dirigo  bti s full service brokerage subsidiary 
after posting a revenue increase of  or  revenue at dirigo investments declined 
for the year ended december   total revenue at dirigo amounted to  compared with in  representing a decrease of  or 
it is anticipated that the expansion of dirigo s market area via the opening of an office in bangor  maine  the strengthening of professional brokerage staff during  and the ongoing expansion of its product offerings  will have a stabilizing impact on dirigo s future revenue 
non interest expense non interest expense from financial services represented of the company s total non interest expense  compared with and in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   total non interest expense at bti amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing a decrease of  and an increase of  or and  respectively 
included in non interest expense is a one time restructuring charge of recorded in the fourth quarter  primarily as a result of management changes within bti 
excluding the restructuring charge  non interest expense amounted to  representing an increase of compared with  or 
likewise  without considering the restructuring charge  bti s total non interest expense declined  or 
the decline in non interest expense was attributed to a number of factors 
salaries and employee benefit expenses declined  or  and were principally the result of management and staffing changes 
marketing expense declined from levels  and was principally attributed to large scale marketing campaigns conducted in early  shortly following the formation of bti  and to a lesser extent  more effective utilization of marketing dollars during expense reductions were achieved in a variety of other operating areas as bti pursued austerity initiatives to more closely match expenses with revenues 
offsetting a portion of the expense reductions was a increase in occupancy costs associated with the purchase and renovation of a new bti headquarters complex and occupied in may  and the expansion of office facilities in bangor  maine 
the increase in non interest expense over was principally attributed to salaries and employee benefits expenses  start up marketing and legal expenses  and occupancy costs associated with the expansion of bti 
in response to declining revenues and eroding profitability  bti implemented a variety of expense reduction measures in the fourth quarter of it is anticipated these measures will further reduce bti s current year operating expenses and favorably impact its future profitability 
accounting change during the first half of the company completed its implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires goodwill to be tested for impairment rather than amortized over a period of time 
the company estimated the value of goodwill utilizing several standard valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows  as well as an estimation of the impact of current business conditions on the long term value of the goodwill carried on the balance sheet 
management and the board of directors determined the impact of the overall deterioration of the stock and bond markets on investor activities within its target market area had negatively impacted the value of the company s goodwill balance related the acquisition of dirigo 
this resulted in an estimation of impairment of  net of tax 
as depicted in note of the company s financial statements  the company recorded an after tax charge of in the first quarter of included in bti s non interest expense is  representing the amortization of dirigo goodwill 
pursuant to sfas no 
 no goodwill amortization expense was recorded in income taxes the company s effective income tax rate in amounted to  compared with and in and  respectively 
the decline in the effective income tax rate was principally attributed to increases in the company s tax exempt interest income  primarily resulting from the addition of tax exempt securities to the company s investment securities portfolio 
risk management credit risk credit risk is managed through loan officer authorities  loan policies  the bank s senior loan committee  oversight from the bank s senior credit officer  the directors loan committee  and the bank s board of directors 
management follows a policy of continually identifying  analyzing and grading credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
an ongoing independent review  subsequent to management s review  of individual credits is performed by an independent loan review function that reports to the audit committee of the board of directors 
as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  loans are placed on non accrual status  either due to the delinquent status of principal and or interest  or a judgment by management that  although payments of principal and or interest are current  such action is prudent because collection is in doubt 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal and or interest is days overdue 
consumer loans are generally charged off when principal and or interest payments are days overdue 
non performing loans npls non performing loans include loans on non accrual status  loans which have been treated as troubled debt restructurings and loans past due days or more and still accruing interest 
the following table sets forth the details of non performing loans over the last five years 
non accrual loans and accruing past due days or more at december loans accounted for on a non accrual basis accruing loans contractually past due days or more total non performing loans ratios allowance for loan losses to total loans non performing to total loans allowance for loan losses to non performing loans the company continued to maintain its non performing loans at significantly lower levels than in prior years and attributes this improvement to a strengthening of its credit administration processes and underwriting standards  aided by a healthy local economy 
during  the company established a centralized loan collection and managed asset department  and enhanced collection efforts for problem loans 
over the past two years  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans declined basis points and  as of december   stood at their lowest level in six years 
non performing loans declined  or in  following a decline of  or in at december   total non performing loans amounted to  or of total loans  compared with  or at the prior year end  and  or at december  the reduction in non performing loans was principally attributed to one relationship with non accruing aggregate outstanding loans at december   of  of which  was charged off and the balance repaid upon asset liquidation  a repayment by one particular customer  and other loans brought current 
at december   the company s allowance for loan losses expressed as a percent of non performing loans was  compared with and at december  and  respectively 
allowance for loan losses and provision the allowance for loan losses allowance is available to absorb losses on loans 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance and provisioning for estimated losses is evaluated quarterly based on review of loans  with particular emphasis on non performing and other loans that management believes warrant special consideration 
the bank s board of directors reviews the evaluation of the allowance to ensure its adequacy 
the allowance is maintained at a level that  in management s judgment  is appropriate for the amount of risk inherent in the loan portfolio  given past  present and expected conditions  and adequate to provide for probable losses that have already occurred 
reserves are established for specific loans including impaired loans  a pool of reserves based on historical charge offs by loan types  and supplemental reserves to reflect current economic conditions  industry specific risks  and other observable data 
loan loss provisions are recorded  and the allowance is increased  when loss is identified and deemed likely 
specific reserves for impaired loans are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
the amount of loans considered to be impaired totaled as of december   compared with  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the related allowances for loan losses on these impaired loans was  and  as of december   and  respectively 
the amount of interest income not recorded on impaired loans was  and as of december   and  respectively 
no portion of the allowance is restricted to any loan or group of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb realized losses 
the amount and timing of realized losses and future allowance allocations may vary from current estimates 
management recognizes that early and accurate recognition of risk is the best means to reduce credit losses and maximize earnings 
the company employs a comprehensive risk management structure to identify and manage the risk of loss 
for consumer loans  the company identifies loan delinquency beginning at day delinquency and provides appropriate follow up by written correspondence or personal contact 
non residential mortgage consumer losses are recognized no later than the point at which a loan is days past due 
residential mortgage losses are recognized during the foreclosure process when that loss is quantifiable and reasonably assured 
for commercial loans the company applies a risk grading system 
this system stratifies the portfolio and allows management to focus appropriate efforts on the highest risk components of the portfolio 
the risk grades include ratings that correlate with regulatory definitions of pass  other assets especially mentioned  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
loan loss provisions are recorded and the allowance is increased when loss is identified and deemed likely 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changing economic conditions and the economic prospects of the borrowers may necessitate future additions or reductions to the allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance  which also may necessitate future additions or reductions to the allowance  based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
the following table  summary of loan loss experience  includes an analysis of the changes to the allowance for loan loss for the past five years 
summary of loan loss experience balance at beginning of period charge offs commercial  financial agricultural  others real estate construction and development mortgage installments and other loans to individuals total charge offs recoveries commercial  financial agricultural  others real estate construction and development mortgage installments and other loans to individuals total recoveries net charge offs provision charged to operations balance at end of period average loans outstanding during period net charge offs to average loans outstanding during period the company s loan charge off experience improved significantly during for the year ended december  net loans charged off amounted to  compared with  in and  in  representing a decrease of  and an increase of  or and  respectively 
the increase in loan charge offs included one large credit exceeding for the year ended december   the company provided  to the allowance for loan losses  compared with  in  representing a decrease of  or 
the provision for loan losses provision in was of average loans  in was  and in was  or of average loans 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses was attributed  in part  to one large credit exceeding  that was charged off in  the repayment of certain previously classified loans  and an overall strengthening of credit quality in the loan portfolio 
portfolio characteristics and relatively stable economic conditions also contributed to the lower provision in the following table presents the five year breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan type at each respective year end 
allocation of allowance for possible loan losses at december amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate mortgages real estate construction real estate mortgage installments and other loans to individuals other unallocated total at december   the loan loss adequacy analysis resulted in a need for specific reserves of  general reserves of  impaired reserves of  and other reserves of specific reserves are determined by way of individual review of commercial loan relationships in excess of  combined with reserves calculated against total outstandings by category using the company s historical loss experience and other observable data 
general reserves account for the risk and probable loss inherent in certain pools of industry and geographic concentration within the loan portfolio 
loan concentrations continue to reflect the company s business region 
the loan portfolio includes  of loans to the hospitality industry  or of total loans  compared with  or  at december  there were no major changes in loan concentrations during however  changes were made to the allowance calculation to incorporate loss estimates relating to emerging issues in the blueberry industry  to which the company has extended credit  and principally centered in washington county  maine 
over the past two to three years  blueberry inventories have grown as increased supplies have exceeded demand both here and abroad and prices have softened 
as of december   approximately has been included in the allowance representing management s estimate of inherent losses associated with this industry segment 
management reviews impaired loans to insure such loans are transferred to non accrual and written down when necessary 
the review includes specific analysis of commercial relationships over smaller homogeneous loans are not individually reviewed  but are reserved collectively 
impaired reserves consider all consumer loans that are over days past due and impaired commercial loans which are fully reserved within the specific reserves via individual review and specific allocation of potential loss for loans relationships over  and pool reserves for smaller impaired loans 
the bank had no troubled debt restructurings at december   and all of its impaired loans were considered collateral dependent and were adequately reserved 
total reserves against impaired loans were at december  loan delinquency levels have remained at low levels during however  existing loan documentation and or structural weaknesses for certain loans written in prior years continue to impede collection efforts in certain cases and have impacted probable losses 
these weaknesses are historical in nature and do not necessarily reflect current loan underwriting and documentation standards 
the extent of these problems in the entire loan portfolio is not entirely known  however  it is known that such problems exist and  accordingly  the allowance for loan losses incorporates this knowledge 
based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all attendant factors associated with the loan portfolio  the company considers the allowance for loan losses at december  to be appropriate for the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  and resident in the local and national economy as of that date 
market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
other types of market risk  such as foreign exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the responsibility for balance sheet risk management oversight is the function of the bank s asset liability committee alco  chaired by the chief financial officer and composed of various members of corporate senior management 
alco meets regularly to review balance sheet structure  formulate strategy in light of current and expected economic conditions  adjust product prices as necessary  implement policy  monitor liquidity  and review performance against guidelines established to control exposure to the various types of inherent risk 
interest rate risk can be defined as an exposure to movement in interest rates that could have an adverse impact on the bank s net interest income 
interest rate risk arises naturally from the imbalance in the re pricing  maturity and or cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities 
management s objectives are to measure  monitor and develop strategies in response to the interest rate risk profile inherent in the bank s balance sheet 
the bank s interest rate risk measurement and management techniques incorporate the re pricing and cash flow attributes of balance sheet and off balance sheet instruments as they relate to current and potential changes in interest rates 
the level of interest rate risk  measured in terms of the potential future effect on net interest income  is determined through the use of modeling and other techniques under multiple interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk is evaluated in depth on a quarterly basis and reviewed by alco and the board of directors 
the bank s asset liability management policy  approved annually by the board of directors  establishes interest rate risk limits in terms of variability of net interest income under rising  flat and decreasing rate scenarios 
it is the role of alco to evaluate the overall risk profile and to determine actions to maintain and achieve a posture consistent with policy guidelines 
interest rate risk is monitored through the use of two complementary measures static gap analysis gap and earnings simulation modeling 
while each measurement may have its limitations  taken together they form a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of the bank s interest rate risk  the level of risk over time  and the quantification of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
the bank utilizes an interest rate risk model widely recognized in the financial industry to monitor and measure interest rate risk 
the bank also utilizes an outside consultant to perform rate shocks of its balance sheet  and to perform a variety of other analysis for the alco 
the model simulates the behavior of interest income and expense of all on and off balance sheet instruments under different interest rate scenarios together with a dynamic future balance sheet 
interest rate risk is measured in terms of potential changes in net interest income based upon shifts in the yield curve 
interest rate gap analysis provides a static view of the maturity and re pricing characteristics of the bank s on and off balance sheet positions 
gap is defined as the difference between assets and liabilities re pricing or maturing within specified periods 
an asset sensitive position  or positive gap  indicates that there are more rate sensitive assets than rate sensitive liabilities re pricing or maturing within a specified time period  which would imply a favorable impact on net interest income during periods of rising interest rates 
conversely  a liability sensitive position  or negative gap  generally implies a favorable impact on net interest income during periods of falling interest rates 
there are certain limitations inherent in static gap analysis 
these limitations include the fact that it is a static measurement and it does not reflect the degrees to which interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may respond non proportionally to changes in market interest rates 
although the alco reviews all assumptions used in the model in detail  assets and liabilities do not always have clear re pricing dates  and re pricing may occur earlier or later than assumed in the model 
the bank s static interest rate sensitivity gap is pictured below interest rate risk cumulative static gap position december  and one day to six months over six months to one year one year to five years over five years december  december  change the interest rate risk sensitivity model requires that assets and liabilities be broken down into components as to fixed  variable  and adjustable interest rates  as well as other homogeneous groupings  which are segregated as to maturity and type of instrument 
the model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time and in different interest rate environments 
the model uses contractual re pricing dates for variable products  contractual maturities for fixed rate products  and product specific assumptions for deposits accounts  such as money market accounts  that are subject to re pricing based on current market conditions 
re pricing margins are also determined for adjustable rate assets and incorporated in the model 
investment securities and borrowings with call provisions  are examined on an individual basis in each rate environment to estimate the likelihood of a call 
prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds  based upon similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
cash flows and maturities are then determined  and for certain assets  prepayment assumptions are estimated under different rate scenarios 
interest income and interest expense are then simulated under several rate conditions including a flat interest rate scenario in which today s prevailing rates are locked in and the only balance sheet fluctuations that occur are due to cash flows  maturities  new volumes  and re pricing volumes consistent with this flat rate assumption 
a and basis point rise or decline in interest rates applied against a parallel shift in the yield curve over a twelve month horizon  together with a dynamic balance sheet anticipated to be consistent with such interest rate changes 
various non parallel shifts in the yield curve  including changes in either short term or long term rates over a twelve month horizon  together with a dynamic balance sheet anticipated to be consistent with such interest rate changes 
an extension of the foregoing simulations to each of two  three  four and five year horizons to determine the interest rate risk with the level of interest rates stabilizing in years two through five 
even though rates remain stable during this two to five year time period  the balance sheet has growth similar to the first twelve months modeled for each of the rate conditions  as well as re pricing opportunities driven by maturities  cash flow  and adjustable rate products which will continue to change the balance sheet profile for each of the rate conditions 
changes in net interest income based upon the foregoing simulations are measured against the flat interest rate scenario and actions are taken in order to maintain the balance sheet interest rate risk within established policy guidelines 
the following table summarizes the bank s net interest income sensitivity analysis as of december   over one and two year horizons 
in light of the federal funds rate of on the date presented  the analysis incorporates a declining interest rate scenario of basis points  compared with basis points as shown at december  the table also summarizes net interest income sensitivity under a non parallel shift in the yield curve  whereby short term interest rates rise and basis points  a scenario which management believes is more likely  given the current shape of the yield curve

year base based on the information and assumptions in effect at december   management believes that a basis point increase in interest rates over the next months would increase net interest income  or in  and  or in should short term interest rates rise and the yield curve flatten  management believes that a basis point increase over the next months would increase net interest income by  or  and that a basis point increase during this same period would increase net interest income by  or 
extending this scenario to a twenty four month horizon  and assuming no additional movement in rates in  management believes net interest income would increase and  in and  or and  respectively 
based on the information and assumptions in effect at december   management believes that a basis point decrease in interest rates over the next two years would decrease net interest income  or in  and  or in while the simulated decline in year two falls outside of the bank s policy target of  management believes that a basis point decline in interest rates  or a federal funds targeted rate of  represents a scenario that is not likely to occur 
further  a repositioning of the balance sheet to hedge such a decline  would adversely impact net interest income in a rising rate environment  a scenario management believes is more likely to occur over the longer term 
managing the bank s interest rate risk sensitivity has been challenging during this period of historically low interest rates 
during  the yield curve showed a relatively sharp  downward  parallel shift 
as was anticipated by management through use of the model  the bank s net interest income was moderately impacted and  were it not for the growth in earning assets  would have resulted in a year over year decline 
at december   the bank continued to maintain a moderately asset sensitive balance sheet  positioning itself for an eventual rise in interest rates 
should interest rates remain flat for an extended period of time  and assuming no earning asset growth and a static balance sheet  management believes that net interest income will continue showing slight to moderate declines 
management expects short term interest rates may be susceptible to further declines during  with the balance of the yield curve holding relatively constant 
management believes that the current level of interest rate risk is acceptable 
the bank engages an independent consultant to periodically review its interest rate risk position and the reasonableness of assumptions used  with periodic reports provided to the bank s board of directors 
at december   there were no significant differences between the views of the independent consultant and management regarding the bank s interest rate risk exposure 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels and yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results may also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels deviating from those assumed  the impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals  product preference changes  and other such variables 
the sensitivity analysis also does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
derivative instruments and hedging activities as part of the bank s overall interest rate risk management strategy  management periodically uses derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility 
the bank s interest rate risk management strategy involves modifying the re pricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates do not have a significant adverse effect on net interest income  the net interest margin and cash flows 
derivative instruments that management periodically uses as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps  caps and floors 
a policy statement  approved by the board of directors of the bank  governs use of these instruments 
at december   the bank had one derivative instrument outstanding  an interest rate swap  compared with none at the prior year end 
the details are summarized as follows description maturity notional amount in thousands fixed interest rate variable interest rate hedge pool receive fixed rate  pay variable rate 
prime home equity loans the million interest rate swap hedges a defined pool of the bank s home equity loans yielding an interest rate of prime  which at december  was 
the bank is required to pay a counter party monthly variable rate payments indexed to prime  while receiving monthly fixed rate payments based upon an interest rate of over the term of the agreement 
the credit risk associated with the interest rate swap agreement is the risk of non performance by the counter party to the agreement 
however  management does not anticipate non performance by the counter party  and monitors risk through its asset liability management policies and procedures 
the interest rate swap agreement  which qualifies as a cash flow hedge  has an original maturity of two years and as of december  had an unrealized gain of thousand 
in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  the unrealized gain is recorded in the statement of condition with the offset recorded in the statement of other comprehensive income 
the use of the interest rate swap agreement increased interest income by during liquidity risk liquidity is measured by the company s ability to meet short term cash needs at a reasonable cost or minimal loss 
the company seeks to obtain favorable sources of liabilities and to maintain prudent levels of liquid assets in order to satisfy varied liquidity demands 
besides serving as a funding source for maturing obligations  liquidity provides flexibility in responding to customer initiated needs 
many factors affect the company s ability to meet liquidity needs  including variations in the markets served by its network of offices  its mix of assets and liabilities  reputation and credit standing in the marketplace  and general economic conditions 
the company actively manages its liquidity position through target ratios established under its asset liability management policy 
continual monitoring of these ratios  both historical and through forecasts under multiple rate scenarios  allows the company to employ strategies necessary to maintain adequate liquidity 
the company uses a basic surplus deficit model to measure its liquidity over and day time horizons 
the relationship between liquid assets and short term liabilities that are vulnerable to non replacement are routinely monitored 
the company s policy is to maintain its liquidity position at a minimum of of total assets 
at december   liquidity  as measured by the basic surplus deficit model  was for the day horizon and for the day horizon 
a portion of the company s deposit bases is seasonal in nature  with balances typically declining in the winter months through late spring  during which period the company s liquidity position tightens 
at december   the company had  in unused lines of credit  and qualifying collateral availability to support a  increase in its line of credit with the federal home loan bank 
the company also had capacity to borrow funds on a serviced basis utilizing certain un pledged securities 
the company maintains a liquidity contingency plan approved by the bank s board of directors 
this plan addresses the steps that would be taken in the event of a liquidity crisis  and identifies other sources of liquidity available to the company 
off balance sheet risks commitments to extend credit the company makes contractual commitments to extend credit and extends lines of credit  which are subject to the company s credit approval and monitoring procedures 
as more fully described in note to the financial statements  at december  and  commitments to extend credit in the form of loans  including unused lines of credit and commitments to originate loans  amounted to  and  respectively 
increases in the unused lines of credit on home equity loans  combined with commercial lines of credit at year end  are responsible for the  increase in unused lines and commitments compared with in the opinion of management  there are no material commitments to extend credit that represent unusual risks 
letters of credit and stand by letters of credit the company guarantees the obligations or performance of customers by issuing letters of credit and standby letters of credit to third parties 
these letters of credit are sometimes issued in support of third party debt 
the risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to customers  and they are subject to the same origination  portfolio maintenance and management procedures in effect to monitor other credit and off balance sheet products 
at december  and  outstanding letters of credit and standby letters of credit totaled  and  respectively 
counter party risk pursuant to its asset liability management policy  the bank may enter into interest rate swap and floor agreements under which the bank and the swap or floor counter party would be obligated to exchange interest payments on notional principal amounts 
for swap and floor transactions  the contract or notional amount does not represent exposure to credit loss 
the bank would be exposed to risk should the counter party default in its responsibility to pay interest under the terms of the swap or floor agreement 
the bank controls counter party risk through credit approvals  limits  and monitoring procedures
