if we and mgm mirage agree to future scope changes  there could be sharing of additional costs 
any costs over the original budget that may be incurred  up to the newly agreed upon total project cost of billion  would be equally funded by both parties through additional equity contributions 
any funding of project costs over the agreed upon billion  if required  is our responsibility and would not proportionally increase our ownership of borgata

new accounting policies in april  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the most significant provisions of this statement relate to the rescission of statement no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and it also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
under this new statement  any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods that does not meet certain defined criteria must be reclassified 
we adopted this statement during the quarter ended september  pursuant to the early adoption of this statement  we reported losses on early retirement of debt in the other income expense section of the consolidated statement of operations 
see note  long term debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our debt retirements 
there were no early retirements of debt in previous periods and  as such  there were no prior period reclassifications recorded 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
a fundamental conclusion reached by the fasb in sfas no 
is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation to others that meet the definition of a liability 
this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  with early application encouraged 
we currently do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of sfas nos 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
this interpretation also incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded 
the provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   and the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we adopted the disclosure requirements of this interpretation during the year ended december  we have a completion guaranty for borgata  our atlantic city joint venture 
for further information  see note  investment in joint venture and other unconsolidated subsidiaries to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and 
table of contents interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
generally  we adopted this statement during the year ended december  and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have certain characteristics 
the requirements of this standard are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods beginning after june  we currently do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies may require a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets in accordance with the applications of sfas no 
related to goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
related to impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory  social and economic climates  recent operating information and budgets of the various properties where we conduct operations 
these estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal  state or local regulations  economic downturns  or other events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties 
during the quarter ended march   we completed the impairment testing of all of our goodwill and intangible license rights balances and recorded an million charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in order to write down the remaining goodwill balance related to the acquisition of the stardust 
in addition  sfas no 
requires periodic analysis of our goodwill and intangible assets in future accounting periods 
if our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods 
in accordance with sfas no 
regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we continue to monitor results from our stardust and sam s town tunica properties 
if either property produces or continues to produce operating losses without the prospect of becoming profitable  we may be subject to a non cash writedown of our assets which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
derivative instruments 
in  we created a policy aimed at managing risks associated with our current and anticipated future borrowings  such as interest rate risk and its potential impact on our fixed and variable rate debt 
under this policy  we may utilize derivative contracts that effectively convert our borrowings from either floating rate to fixed or fixed rate to floating 
the policy does not allow for the use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
to the extent we employ such financial instruments pursuant to this policy  and the instruments qualify for hedge accounting  we designate and account for them as hedged instruments 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the underlying hedged item must expose us to risks associated with market fluctuations and the financial instrument used must be designated as a hedge and must reduce our exposure to market fluctuations throughout the hedged period 
if these criteria are not met  a change in the market value of the financial instrument is recognized as a gain or loss in the period of change 
otherwise  gains and losses are not recognized except to the extent that the hedged debt is disposed of prior to maturity or to 
table of contents the extent that acceptable ranges of ineffectiveness exist in the hedge 
net interest paid or received pursuant to the financial instrument is included in interest expense in the period 
at december   we had one swap outstanding with a million notional amount 
this swap meets the criteria for hedge accounting established by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 as well as the criteria for the shortcut method  which allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness 
as such  there was no impact on our consolidated statement of operations from changes in the fair value of the swap 
at december   we recorded an asset of million in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  representing the fair market value of the swap as of december  the corresponding adjustment increased the carrying value of the long term debt item hedged  as the interest rate swap is considered highly effective under sfas no 
in addition  borgata  our venture project  has entered into derivative financial instruments to either fix or maintain  within a certain range  interest rates on its floating rate debt to comply with the requirements of its bank credit agreement 
these derivative financial instruments have an initial aggregate notional amount of approximately million and terms ranging from december to december on may   these derivative financial instruments were designated as cash flow hedges 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in preopening income on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and other comprehensive losses totaling million  net of million in tax benefits representing our portion of the decrease in fair value of the derivative instruments 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in preopening expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations as a result of ineffectiveness in certain of the hedges and recorded million of other comprehensive losses  net of million of tax benefit  representing our portion of the decrease in fair value of the derivative instruments 
future changes in the fair value of the derivatives or any ineffectiveness of these derivatives as hedges will further impact our financial position or results of operations 
for more information on the derivatives  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk litigation  claims and assessments 
we also utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based upon our knowledge and experience about past and current events and also upon reasonable assumptions about future events 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk  specifically long term us treasury rates and the applicable spreads in the high yield investment market and short term and long term eurodollar rates  and its potential impact on our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under our bank credit facility 
borrowings under our bank credit facility are based upon either the agent bank s quoted base rate or the eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin that is determined by the level of a predefined financial leverage ratio 
however  the amount of outstanding borrowings is expected to fluctuate from time to time 
we also attempt to manage the impact of interest rate risk on our long term debt by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
for more information  see note  derivative instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   we utilized three interest rate swap agreements 
two of these swap agreements were terminated on december   leaving one swap agreement with a million notional amount outstanding at december  interest differentials resulting from these agreements are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense 
interest rate swaps related to debt are matched to specific fixed rate debt obligations 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the interest rate swap agreement remaining at december  however  we believe that this risk is minimized because the 
table of contents counterparty to the swap is an existing lender under our bank credit facility 
if we had terminated our remaining swap as of december   we would have received a net amount of million based on quoted market values from the financial institution holding the swap 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments both debt obligations and the interest rate swap that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates for our outstanding debt at december  and related weighted average interest rates as of december  for the interest rate swap  the table presents the notional amount by its contractual maturity date and variable rate 
the notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract 
the variable rate is based upon prevailing interest rates 
the scheduled maturities of our long term debt and interest rate swap agreement outstanding as of december  for the years ending december are as follows year ending december  thereafter total in thousands liabilities long term debt including current portion fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps pay floating average receivable rate average est

during the three month period ended march   a subsidiary of mddc entered into interest rate protection agreements with an initial aggregate notional amount of approximately million that cover various periods ranging from to the interest rate protection agreements are
