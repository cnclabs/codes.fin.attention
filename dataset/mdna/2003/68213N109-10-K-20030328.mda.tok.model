item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  this annual report on form k contains predictions  estimates and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from any future performance suggested in this report as a result of many factors  including those referred to in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  under the heading factors that may affect future operating results and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we started our business in and began offering our supply automation systems for sale in in late  we introduced our omnicell medication dispensing system 
in january  we expanded our line of medication dispensing systems and customer base with the acquisition of the sure med product line from baxter healthcare corporation 
in  we acquired two additional products  omnicell pharmacycentral  a central pharmacy carousel storage and retrieval solution  and safetymed  a bedside automation solution 
as of december   we had installed or released for installation  of our medication and supply dispensing systems at  healthcare facilities 
we sell our medication and supply dispensing systems primarily in the united states 
we have a direct sales force organized into six regions in the united states and canada 
we sell through distributors in europe  the middle east  asia and australia 
we manufacture the majority of our systems in our production facility in palo alto  california  with refurbishment and spare parts activities conducted in our waukegan  illinois facility 
we bill our customers upon delivery and acceptance of our medication and supply dispensing systems and recognize revenue when the systems are installed 
deferred gross profit on our balance sheet represents primarily medication and supply dispensing systems that have been shipped to  accepted  and  in most instances  paid for by our customers but not yet installed at the customer site 
we record these shipments as deferred gross profit because title to the inventory has passed to the customer 
during  the value of our product shipments was less than the value of our systems installed and as a result our deferred gross profit declined to million at december  compared to million at december  deferred gross profit was reported net of million and million of deferred cost of sales  excluding installation costs  as of december  and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed our focus from growing deferred gross profit which is based on shipment growth to growing product backlog which is based on order growth 
product backlog is defined as the amount of medication and supply dispensing systems that has shipped to customers but is not yet installed at the customer site plus the amount of such systems that has not shipped but for which we have purchase orders 
our product backlog as of december  was million 
the change in focus to building product backlog has allowed the company to be more linear and efficient in its manufacturing and installation processes 
in october  we initiated a restructuring of our organization to reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies 
as part of this restructuring  we reduced headcount by  or employees 
restructuring charges of million were recorded in the fourth quarter of and were primarily related to employee severance and benefits 
the total cash outlay related to these charges was approximately million in and the remaining charges of million are expected to be paid by november and are included in accrued liabilities as of december  restatement of the three and nine months ended september  in february  we filed a quarterly report on form q a amending items   the factor that may affect future operating results entitled we have a history of operating losses and we cannot assure you when we will regain profitability in item and item of part i of our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  this amendment was filed to reflect the restatement of our financial statements for the three and nine months ended september  relating to million of product revenue incorrectly reported in the third quarter of we record product revenue on our sales of medication and supply dispensing systems based upon completion of our installation obligation  if any  at the customer site 
in january  we discovered that certain products representing aggregate revenue of million had not been installed as reported as of september  approximately  worth of these products was installed in the fourth quarter of and the balance  approximately  of products  remained to be installed as of december  as a result of this restatement  for the three months ended september   total revenues decreased by million to million  net loss increased  to million and net loss per share increased from to 
for the nine months ended september   total revenues decreased by million to million  net income decreased from  to a net loss of  and earnings per share decreased from to 
the effect of this restatement on the condensed consolidated balance sheets was to increase deferred gross profit and to decrease stockholders equity by increasing accumulated deficit by  at september  the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k fully reflect the year to date results of this restatement as of december  in connection with this restatement  omnicell re evaluated certain of its internal controls and is in the process of implementing additional internal controls relating to the recording of revenue on installation of product at customer sites  which includes a general policy of requiring written acknowledgement from customers upon completion of installation of our product 
revenues customers acquire our medication and supply dispensing systems either through an outright purchase or a non cancelable long term lease  which typically has a term of months 
we bill our customers upon delivery and acceptance of our medication and supply dispensing systems and recognize revenue when the systems are installed 
generally  we try to install our medication and supply dispensing systems within three to six months after shipment  but installation can  at the customer s request  be delayed for a year or more 
some customers experience delays in installation due to site construction and delays in receiving interfaces from third parties 
typically we will sell our customer lease agreements on a non recourse basis to third party leasing companies 
product revenue is recognized for the net present value of the lease payment stream 
as part of the initial sale or lease of our medication and supply dispensing systems  customers typically sign a one year service agreement  and service revenues are recognized over the term of these agreements 
service and other revenues also include month to month rentals of our medication and supply dispensing systems and amortization of upfront fees received from certain distributors of our medication and supply dispensing systems and monthly subscription fees from hospitals utilizing our internet based procurement application 
revenues from our medication and supply dispensing systems are difficult to forecast because the sales cycle  from initial assessment to product installation  involves a significant commitment of capital and time  varies substantially from customer to customer and can take more than one year 
the order approval processes of our customers are subject to internal procedures associated with large capital expenditures and the time associated with accepting new technologies 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle associated with the purchase of our medication and supply dispensing systems is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews over which we have little or no control 
costs and expenses our current expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations of higher future revenue levels 
if revenue levels are below expectations  operating results are likely to be disproportionately impacted given our significant investment in infrastructure 
we achieved profitability on a quarterly basis for the last two quarters of and the first two quarters of  but have never achieved operating profitability on an annual basis 
for these reasons  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
cost of product revenues consists primarily of direct materials  labor and overhead required to manufacture medication and supply dispensing systems and also includes costs required to install our systems at the customer location 
cost of service and other revenues includes spare parts required to maintain and support installed systems and service and maintenance expense  including outsourced contract services 
direct materials and installation costs are mostly variable 
manufacturing labor and overhead remain relatively fixed over ranges of production volume 
the cost of service and spare parts has increased as the size of our installed base of customers has increased 
our research and development expenses include engineering and development salaries  wages and benefits  prototyping and laboratory expenses  consulting expenses and engineering related facilities and overhead charges 
most of the research and development expenses are personnel or facilities related and are relatively fixed 
prototyping and consulting expenses will vary depending on the stage of completion of various engineering and development projects 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include costs to support the sales  marketing  field operations and customer support and administration organizations 
most of these costs are personnel or facilities related and are relatively fixed 
bonuses and sales commissions will typically change in proportion to revenue or profitability 
other expenditures  such as advertising  promotions and consulting  are neither fixed nor variable and will fluctuate depending on product introductions  promotional programs and trade shows 
deferred stock compensation for options granted to employees reflects the difference between the deemed fair market value of our common stock on the date options were granted to employees and the exercise price of those options 
deferred stock compensation is reflected as a component of stockholders equity net capital deficiency and the deferred expense is being amortized to operations over the two to four year vesting periods of the options using the graded vesting method 
the graded vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall awards at interim dates and results in greater vesting in earlier years than the straight line method 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
it requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventory  other assets  business combinations  accrued liabilities and restructuring charges to be critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is important because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and installation expenses 
we follow specific and detailed policies on recognizing revenue 
revenue results are difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
omnicell recognizes revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
we recognize a sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  omnicell s price to the customer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a key requirement for omnicell to recognize revenue from the sale of our automation products is the completion of our installation obligation at the customer site 
delays at a customer site due to construction delays or for other causes could result in our inability to install enough systems to achieve our revenue targets 
revenues from lease arrangements are recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for leases  upon completion of our installation obligation and at the beginning of the non cancelable lease term 
most of our lease receivables are sold to third party leasing finance companies 
we record revenue at the net present value of the lease stream utilizing an implicit interest rate comparable to those charged by a third party leasing company 
we exclude from revenues any amount paid to leasing companies for the termination of an existing lease pursuant to a new lease 
we have no obligation under the lease once it is sold to a leasing company 
in   and  sales of medication and supply dispensing systems sold under net sales type lease agreements totaled approximately million and million and million  respectively 
in and  customer lease receivables sold to third party leasing companies totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
at december  and  accounts receivable included approximately million and million  respectively  due from finance companies for lease receivables sold 
us government customers sign five year non cancelable leases but are subject to one year government budget funding cycles 
in our judgment and based on our history with these accounts  we believe these leases are collectible 
however  in the future  if any of our us government customers do not receive their annual funding  their lease payments could be delayed or stopped which could significantly impair our ability to recognize revenues on future sales to us government customers and result in a write down of our unsold leases to us government customers 
as of december  the balance of our unsold leases to us government customers was million 
post installation technical support  such as phone support  on site service  parts and access to software upgrades  is provided by the company under separate service agreements 
when support services are sold under multiple element arrangements  the company allocates revenue to support services based upon its relative fair value which is determined by the average discount pricing of the arrangement applied separately to each product and support service component 
revenues on service agreements are recognized ratably over the related service contract period 
deferred service revenue represents amounts received under service agreements for which the services have not yet been performed and up front fees received from certain distributors of our medication and supply dispensing systems 
these up front fees are recognized ratably over the periods of the distribution agreements 
accounts receivable we actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize credit risk 
we typically sell to customers for which there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial position and ability to pay 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
inventory omnicell writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
other assets purchased residuals although the company had no contractual obligation to do so  in july  it executed an agreement to purchase from americorp financial  inc afi all residual interests in omnicell equipment covered by leasing agreements financed by afi 
the total purchase price was million 
the purchase price was assigned to the acquired lease residuals based on the original implied lease residual value  leased equipment type  and the company s assessment of the customers likelihood of renewal at the end of the lease term 
as leases are renewed or upgraded  the company charges the assigned value to cost of product revenues 
when leases are not renewed or upgraded at the end of the lease contract or when the company believes a renewal is unlikely  the assigned value is written off 
the leases associated with the purchased residuals expire at various dates within four years from the date of the purchase agreement 
purchased residuals are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows 
if actual demand  market condition or timing of new products introductions differ from those projected by management  the value of purchased residuals could become significantly impaired 
the value of purchased residuals at december  was million and is recorded in other assets 
capitalized software development costs development costs related to software implemented in our medication and supply dispensing systems incurred subsequent to the establishment of technical feasibility are capitalized and amortized over the estimated lives of the related products 
technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model  which is a matter of judgment using the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
all such development costs incurred prior to the completion of a working model are recognized as research and development expense 
business combinations impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company has adopted a policy for measuring goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
no impairment of goodwill was recognized for the year ended december  the company did not have any goodwill in purchased intangible assets include software and customer relationships acquired in a business combination 
purchased intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives of five or six years 
additionally  purchased intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows 
no impairment of purchased intangible assets was recognized for the year ended december  the company did not have any purchased intangible assets in accrued liabilities accrued liabilities are based on our judgment of estimated future costs for goods or services already received or obligations incurred 
actual costs may differ from those estimates 
our estimates for accrued customer upgrade costs of million at december  required a significant amount of judgment related to forecasted costs of materials  labor  travel and other costs required to fulfill upgrade obligations to certain sure med customers we assumed under our purchase of sure med in january our estimates can and have changed based on actual costs incurred in completing these obligations 
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring program to focus and streamline our business and reduce operating expenses 
in connection with this program  we reduced headcount by approximately  or employees 
as a result  we recorded restructuring costs of million primarily related to employee severance and benefits 
the total cash outlay related to these charges was  in and the remaining charges of million are expected to be paid by november and are included in accrued liabilities as of december  the amounts recorded are estimates based on the status of execution of our restructuring plan 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items included in our results of operations for the years ended december   and  expressed as a percentage of our total revenues for these periods year ended december  statement of operations product revenues service and other revenues total revenues cost of product revenues cost of service and other revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring purchased in process research and development total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  product revenues decreased by to million in from million in  due primarily to a decrease in the number of medication and supply dispensing system installations in as compared to the reduction in the number of units installed was partially offset by an increase in the relative proportion of medication dispensing systems sold  which have higher selling prices than our supply dispensing systems 
in addition  we experienced an increase in the average selling prices of our supply dispensing systems in as compared with due to increased customer demand for our higher priced systems 
we expect product revenue in the first quarter of to be essentially flat with the fourth quarter of throughout the rest of  we expect sequential quarterly product revenue growth 
service and other revenues increased by to million in from million in the increase in service and other revenues was primarily due to the increase in our installed base of automation systems combined with an increase in the number of leases that are sold with service contracts 
we anticipate that service and other revenues in on a quarterly basis will be similar to the fourth quarter of  or approximately million per quarter 
cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues increased to million in from million in total cost of revenues as a percent of total revenues increased to in  from in cost of product revenues increased by to million in from million in gross profit on product sales was million or of product revenues in as compared to million  or of product revenues in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of product revenues in as compared to was due to fewer higher margin sales  a relatively fixed manufacturing overhead spread over a lower unit volume  and higher installation expense since fewer customers accepted responsibility for their own installations 
in addition  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of product revenues in was due to a write down to lower of cost or market of returned materials and higher storage and shipping costs 
we expect gross profit on product sales as a percentage of product revenues to be approximately the same in cost of service and other revenues increased slightly by to million in from million in gross profit on service and other revenues was million  or of service and other revenues in compared to million  or of service and other revenues in the increase in gross margin on service and other revenues in as compared to reflects a reduction in costs from our third party service provider and the utilization of a higher concentration of refurbished product  for which our costs are minimal  to fulfill our service requirements 
we believe that cost of service and other revenues will continue to grow in absolute dollars from service contracts associated with the growth of our installed base of medication and supply dispensing systems 
we expect that gross margin on service and other revenues will continue to fluctuate based upon our ability to sustain cost improvements from our third party vendor and on the ability to utilize refurbished product in the fulfillment of our service offerings 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by to million in from million in research and development expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expense in is due primarily to an increase in the amount of capitalized software development costs relating to a major upgrade to our application software 
in  we capitalized approximately million of software development costs compared to million of software development costs capitalized in additionally  we lowered our research and development spending in our e commerce business to million in from million in we anticipate that we will continue to commit significant resources to research and development in future periods to enhance and extend our offerings 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses on an absolute dollar basis reflect higher occupancy and travel costs partially offset by lower expenses for bonuses and amortization of deferred stock compensation 
we expect that selling  general  and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue will decline in  as a result of our reduction in headcount as part of our october restructuring and cost reduction initiatives 
restructuring 
restructuring charges were million in and million in in  we restructured our organization to reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies 
as part of this restructuring  we reduced headcount by  or employees 
as a result  we recorded restructuring costs of million in the fourth quarter of primarily related to employee severance and benefits 
the total cash outlay related to these charges was  in in  we reversed the remaining outstanding restructuring accrual from a restructuring charge in in the amount of  related to estimated severance and benefits 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
deferred stock compensation for options granted to employees reflects the difference between the deemed fair market value of our common stock on the date options were granted to employees and the exercise price of those options 
deferred stock compensation is reflected as a component of stockholders equity net capital deficiency and the deferred expense is being amortized to operations over the two to four year vesting periods of the options using the graded vesting method 
in the year ended december   we amortized million of deferred compensation expense  which included million to research and development expenses and million to selling  general and administrative expenses 
the balance of deferred stock compensation as of december  was million 
interest and other income 
interest and other income increased to million in from million in the increase in interest and other income was due to a recovery of million from an investment in equity securities of a privately held company written off in a prior year and a million one time gain on the sale of a portion of our government lease portfolio 
the remaining balance of million of interest and other income in and the entire balance in were comprised primarily of interest income from cash  short term investments  and notes receivable from stockholders 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease is due primarily to a decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of outstanding debt  partially offset by a write off of an investment in equity securities of a privately held company of million that was deemed impaired in the first quarter of provision for income taxes 
due to the losses we incurred  and the related net operating loss carryforwards available to us  we recorded minimal total state and federal income tax expense in and million in also impacting was an  tax benefit relating to a change in the calculation of the alternative minimum tax credit for due to a change in the tax law resulting from the job creation and worker assistance act of utilization of the company s net operating loss may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization 
product backlog 
effective as of september  we report our product backlog position as of the end of each quarter 
our product backlog increased million to million as of december  from million as of september  years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  product revenues increased by to million in from million in  due primarily to an increased number of medication and supply dispensing system installations 
these increases were the result of increased installation of equipment for new customers or new equipment sales for existing customers where leases were due to expire 
service and other revenues increased by to million in from million in  due primarily to an increase in the number of new service contracts and increased renewals of existing service contracts 
cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues increased to million in from million in total cost of revenues as a percent of total revenues decreased to in from in cost of product revenues increased by to million in from million in gross profit on product sales was million or of product revenues in as compared to million  or of product revenues in the decrease in the gross profit as a percentage of product revenues in as compared to was due primarily to an increase in the mix of products sold through lower margin leases as compared to purchased products  a higher percentage of lower margin pharmacy products in compared to and write downs of inventory of approximately million 
cost of service and other revenues decreased by to million in from million in  primarily due to a lower volume of sure med installation kits which are more costly than omnicell automation system installation kits and a shift in strategy from the utilization of third party maintenance contract service providers to in house maintenance service engineers in gross profit on service and other revenues was million  or of service and other revenues in compared to million  or of service and other revenues in the increase in gross profit and gross margin on service and other revenues in compared to  was due to the positive impact of recognizing million in service billings in to several customers for services provided and expensed in previous periods that were not previously billed  more focus on services contract renewals in compared to and reductions in outsourced contract services and spare parts required to maintain installed systems 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by to million in from million in research and development expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the corporate restructuring which occurred in the third quarter of  in which we reduced our efforts in our e commerce business 
this resulted in a reduction of the portion of our engineering force dedicated to our e commerce development 
in  we capitalized approximately million of software development costs compared to million of software development costs capitalized in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by to million in from million in selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to staffing decreases associated with our corporate restructuring which occurred in the third quarter of  in which we reduced our efforts in our e commerce business  partially offset by staffing increases to re focus our efforts on our core medication and supply dispensing systems business 
restructuring 
a restructuring credit in of  represents a reversal of the accrued liability for restructuring which was established in the third quarter of this restructuring action resulted from the reduction of our efforts in our e commerce business 
the reversal reflected lower than anticipated employee severance and benefit costs 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in the year ended december   we amortized million of deferred compensation expense  which included million to research and development expenses and million to selling  general and administrative expenses 
the balance of deferred stock compensation as of december  was million 
interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased to million in from million in this decrease in interest income was primarily the result of declining interest rates in interest and other expense 
interest and other expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily the result of the repayment of million of outstanding debt and redeemable convertible preferred stock obligations immediately following our initial public offering in august provision for income taxes 
due to the losses we incurred in years prior to  and the related net operating loss carryforwards available to us  we recorded total state and federal income tax expense of million and million in and  respectively 
segment information we report segments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
sfas requires the use of a management approach in identifying segments of an enterprise 
prior to  the company consisted of one operating segment medication and supply dispensing systems 
a second operating segment was created in the second half of with the introduction of our e commerce business 
our chief operating decision maker reviews information pertaining to reportable segments to the operating income level 
there are no significant inter segment sales or transfers 
assets and capital expenditures of the operating segments are not segregated and substantially all of our long lived assets are located in the united states 
for the years ended december   and  substantially all of our total revenues and gross profit were generated by the medication and supply dispensing systems operating segment 
the internet based e commerce business segment generated less than one percent of consolidated revenues in each of the years ended december   and the operating losses generated by the internet based e commerce business segment were approximately million  million  million excluding a million restructuring charge in the years ended december   and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our funds are currently invested in institutional money market funds and short term interest bearing securities

the credit agreement pertaining to these credit facilities was modified on december  to reflect our current financial position 
the revolving credit facility provides us with advances of up to of eligible receivables as defined  up to million  and expires on july  any advances under the revolving credit facility would be secured by substantially all of omnicell s assets

in addition  cash used for operating activities during was increased by the net loss of million and reduced by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million 
cash provided from investing activities was million in and million in  compared to cash used for investing activities of million in cash used for investment and acquisition activities in  included million for an investment in a privately held company  million for the acquisition of substantially all of the intellectual property assets of medisafe and million for the acquisition of aprs  inc net maturities of short term investments were million in and million in  as compared to net purchases of short term investments of million in expenditures for property and equipment were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we generated net cash from financing activities of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of raising funds through issuances of our equity securities as a result of the exercise of employee stock options and stock issuances under the employee stock purchase plan of million 
financing activities in each of the years ending december  and consisted primarily of raising funds through issuances of our equity securities 
in august  we completed the initial public offering of million shares of our common stock at an initial public offering price of per share  raising million net of underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding principal and interest on the note held by baxter healthcare incurred in connection with our acquisition of the sure med product line in january we also used approximately million of the net proceeds to redeem  shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock plus accrued interest thereon held by sun healthcare at the closing of the offering 
the period included the issuance of our series k preferred stock  which raised net proceeds of approximately million 
we have not paid any significant amount of taxes to date 
as of december  the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through  federal research and experimentation tax credits of approximately million  which expire in the years through  and federal alternative minimum tax credits of approximately  which have no expiration

the amount due under the note at december  was million 
as of december   we had a cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance of million 
we believe our current cash balances and cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  if demand for our products and services does not continue as currently anticipated  we may be required to raise additional capital through the public equity market  private financings  collaborative arrangements and debt 
in addition  in certain circumstances we may decide that it is in our best interests to raise additional capital to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace 
if additional capital is raised through the issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity  our stockholders may experience dilution  and such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of the common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing  or to obtain it on acceptable terms  we may be unable to execute our business plan 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our operating results or financial condition 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin

the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements or interim or annual periods ending after december  the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our operating results or financial condition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we reduce the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining an investment portfolio which is comprised solely of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
we are exposed to currency exchange fluctuations  as we sell our products internationally 
we manage the sensitivity of our international sales by denominating all transactions in us dollars 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
we classify our short term investments as fixed rate if the rate of return on such instruments remains fixed over their term 
these fixed rate investments include fixed rate us government securities and corporate obligations with contractual maturity dates ranging from less than one year to less than two years 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of our short term investments at december  and dollars in thousands  except percentage rates 
december  average fixed interest rate amortized cost fair value  contractual maturity dates less than one year  one to two years  total  factors that may affect future operating results any reduction in the growth and acceptance of our medication and supply dispensing systems and related services would harm our business 
our medication and supply dispensing systems represent a relatively new approach to managing the distribution of pharmaceuticals and supplies at healthcare facilities 
many healthcare facilities still use traditional approaches that do not include automated methods of medication and supply dispensing management 
as a result  we must continuously educate existing and prospective customers about the advantages of our products 
our medication and supply dispensing systems typically represent a sizeable initial capital expenditure for healthcare organizations 
changes in the budgets of these organizations and the timing of spending under these budgets can have a significant effect on the demand for our medication and supply dispensing systems and related services 
in addition  these budgets are often characterized by limited resources and conflicting spending priorities among different departments 
any decrease in expenditures by these healthcare facilities  particularly our significant customers  could decrease demand for our medication and supply dispensing systems and related services and harm our business 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in marketing our medication and supply dispensing systems or that the level of market acceptance of such systems will be sufficient to generate operating income 
the healthcare industry faces financial constraints and consolidation that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services 
the healthcare industry has faced  and will likely continue to face  significant financial constraints 
for example  the shift to managed care in the s put pressure on healthcare organizations to reduce costs  and the balanced budget act of significantly reduced medicare reimbursement to healthcare organizations 
our automation solutions often involve a significant financial commitment by our customers  and  as a result  our ability to grow our business is largely dependent on our customers information technology budgets 
to the extent healthcare information technology spending declines or increases more slowly than we anticipate  demand for our products and services would be adversely affected 
many healthcare providers have consolidated to create larger healthcare delivery organizations with greater market power 
if this consolidation continues  it could erode our customer base and reduce the size of our target market 
in addition  the resulting organizations could have greater bargaining power  which may lead to price erosion 
the medication management and supply chain solutions market is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants and established companies with greater resources 
the medication management and supply chain solutions market is intensely competitive and is characterized by evolving technologies and industry standards  frequent new product introductions and dynamic customer requirements 
we expect continued and increased competition from current and future competitors  many of whom have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
our current direct competitors in the medication management and supply chain solutions market include pyxis corporation a division of cardinal health  inc and automated healthcare a division of mckesson corporation 
pyxis corporation  in particular  has a significantly larger installed base of customers than we do and over the last couple of years has developed and introduced to the market a significantly larger number of new products 
with the acquisition of omnicell pharmacycentral and safetymed and the development of our open systems solutions  we have gained additional competitors 
they include the baxter medication delivery business of baxter international inc  bridge medical  inc 
an amerisourcebergen company  care fusion  cerner corporation  eclipsys technologies corporation  idx systems corporation  and siemens medical solutions a division of siemens ag 
the competitive challenges we face in the medication management and supply chain solutions market include  but are not limited to our competitors may develop  license or incorporate new or emerging technologies or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services 
certain competitors have greater name recognition and a more extensive installed base of medication and supply dispensing systems or other products and services  and such advantages could be used to increase their market share 
other established or emerging companies may enter the medication management and supply chain solutions market 
current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  including larger  more established healthcare supply companies  thereby increasing their ability to develop and offer products and services to address the needs of our prospective customers 
our competitors may secure products and services from suppliers on more favorable terms or secure exclusive arrangements with suppliers or buyers that may impede the sales of our products and services 
competitive pressures could result in price reductions of our products and services  fewer customer orders and reduced gross margins  any of which could harm our business 
we have a history of operating losses and we cannot assure you when we will achieve profitability 
we had net losses of million   and million in   and respectively 
while we were profitable in the first and second quarters of  we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we can not assure you if or when we will be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly in the future depending on many factors that may include  but are not limited to  the following the size and timing of orders for our medication and supply dispensing systems  and their installation and integration  the overall demand for healthcare medication management and supply chain solutions  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  the number  timing and significance of product enhancements and new product announcements by us or our competitors  the relative proportions of revenues we derive from products and services  our customers budget cycles  changes in our operating expenses  the performance of our products  changes in our business strategy  and economic and political conditions  including fluctuations in interest rates and tax increases 
due to the foregoing factors  our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict 
the purchase of our medication and supply dispensing systems is often part of a customer s larger initiative to re engineer their pharmacy  distribution and materials management systems 
as a result  the purchase of our medication and supply dispensing systems generally involves a significant commitment of management attention and resources by prospective customers and often requires the input and approval of many decision makers  including pharmacy directors  materials managers  nurse managers  financial managers  information systems managers  administrators and boards of directors 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle associated with the sale or lease of our medication and supply dispensing systems is often lengthy and subject to a number of delays over which we have little or no control 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience delays in the future 
a delay in  or loss of  sales of our medication and supply dispensing systems could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could harm our business 
in addition  many of our hospital customers are often slow to install our systems after they are purchased for reasons that are outside our control 
since we recognize revenue only upon installation of our systems at a customer s site  any delay in installation by our customers could also cause a reduction in our revenue for a given quarter 
for all the above reasons  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily indicative of our future performance 
fluctuation in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
if our us government customers do not receive their annual funding  our ability to recognize revenues on future sales to us government customers could be significantly impaired and could result in a write down of our us government leases 
us government customers sign five year non cancelable leases but are subject to one year government budget funding cycles 
in our judgment and based on our history with these accounts  we believe these leases are collectible 
however  in the future  if any of our us government customers do not receive their annual funding  their lease payments could be delayed or stopped which could significantly impair our ability to recognize revenues on future sales to us government customers and result in a write down of our unsold leases to us government customers 
as of december  the balance of our unsold leases to us government customers was million 
if we are unable to recruit and retain skilled and motivated personnel  our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
our success is highly dependent upon the continuing contributions of our key management  sales  technical and engineering staff 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel 
as our products are installed in increasingly complex environments  greater technical expertise will be required 
as our installed base of customers increases  we will also face additional demands on our customer service and support personnel  requiring additional resources to meet these demands 
we may experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
competition for qualified technical  engineering  managerial  sales  marketing  financial reporting and other personnel can be intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
competitors have in the past attempted  and may in the future attempt  to recruit our employees 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with group purchasing organizations or other similar organizations  we may have difficulty selling our products and services 
we have agreements with various group purchasing organizations  such as premier  inc  novation  llc  consorta  inc and broadlane  inc  which enable us to sell more readily our products and services to customers represented by these organizations 
our relationships with these organizations are terminable at the convenience of either party 
the loss of our relationship with premier  for example  could impact the breadth of our customer base and could impair our ability to increase our revenues 
we cannot guarantee that these organizations will renew our contracts on similar terms  if at all  and we cannot guarantee that they will not terminate our contracts before they expire 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for our medication and supply dispensing systems  and our business may suffer if we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of components and equipment on a timely basis 
our production strategy for our medication and supply dispensing systems is to work closely with several key sub assembly manufacturers and equipment providers and utilize lower cost manufacturers whenever possible 
although many of the components of our systems are standardized and available from multiple sources  certain components or subsystems are fabricated according to our specifications 
at any given point in time  we may only use a single source of supply for certain components 
our failure to obtain alternative vendors  if required  for any of the numerous components used to manufacture our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could harm our business 
in addition  any failure of a maintenance contractor to perform adequately could harm our business 
we depend on services from third parties to support our products  and if we are unable to continue these relationships and maintain their services  our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
our ability to develop  manufacture and support our existing products and any future products depends upon our ability to enter into and maintain contractual arrangements with others 
we currently depend upon services from a number of third party vendors  including dade behring  inc  to support our products 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain our existing or future service arrangements  or that we will be able to enter into future arrangements with third parties on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we fail to maintain our existing service arrangements or to establish new arrangements when and as necessary  our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
if we are unable to successfully integrate our automation solutions with the existing information systems of our customers  they may choose not to use our products and services 
for healthcare facilities to fully benefit from our automation solutions  our systems must integrate with their existing information systems 
this may require substantial cooperation  investment and coordination on the part of our customers 
there is little uniformity in the systems currently used by our customers  which complicates the integration process 
if these systems are not successfully integrated  our customers could choose not to use or to reduce their use of our automation solutions  which would harm our business 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our ability to compete 
we believe that our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for products and processes and our ability to preserve our trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets 
we have pursued patent protection in the united states and foreign jurisdictions for technology that we believe to be proprietary and for technology that offers us a potential competitive advantage for our products  and we intend to continue to pursue such protection in the future 
our issued patents relate to various features of our medication and supply dispensing systems 
there can be no assurance that we will file any patent applications in the future  that any of our patent applications will result in issued patents or that  if issued  such patents will provide significant protection for our technology and processes 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or that others will not design around the patents we own 
all of our operating system software is copyrighted and subject to the protection of applicable copyright laws 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
intellectual property claims against us could harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
we are aware of one third party patent issued several years ago that may relate to certain of our products 
although we have received no notice alleging infringement from this third party to date  there can be no assurance that such third party will not assert an infringement claim against us in the future 
other than this patent  we do not believe that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of any third parties 
we cannot assure you  however  that third parties will not claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights with respect to current or future products 
we expect that developers of medication and supply dispensing systems will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
we do not possess special insurance that covers intellectual property infringement claims  however  such claims may be covered under our traditional insurance policies 
these policies contain terms  conditions and exclusions that make recovery for intellectual infringement claims difficult to guarantee 
any infringement claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  which could harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
product liability claims against us could harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
we provide products that provide medication management and supply chain solutions for healthcare 
despite the presence of healthcare professionals as intermediaries between our products and patients  if our products fail to provide accurate and timely information or operate as designed  customers  patients or their family members could assert claims against us for product liability 
also  in the event that any of our products is defective  we may be required to recall or redesign those products 
litigation with respect to liability claims  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial cost to us  divert management s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entail the risk of product liability claims 
we possess a variety of insurance policies that include coverage for general commercial liability and technology errors and omissions liability 
however  these policies may not be adequate against product liability claims 
a successful claim brought against us  or any claim or product recall that results in negative publicity about us  could harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
changing customer requirements could decrease the demand for our products and services 
the medication management and supply chain solutions market is intensely competitive and is characterized by evolving technologies and industry standards  frequent new product introductions and dynamic customer requirements that may render existing products obsolete or less competitive 
as a result  our position in the medication management and supply chain solutions market could erode rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products  as well as the pricing models for such products 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services to meet changing customer requirements 
the process of developing products and services such as those we offer is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future as new technologies are introduced 
if we are unable to enhance our existing products or develop new products to meet changing customer requirements  demand for our products could decrease 
we may be required to seek additional financing to meet our future capital needs  which we may not be able to secure on favorable terms  or at all 
we plan to continue to expend substantial funds for research and development activities  product development  integration efforts and expansion of accounts receivable and sales and marketing activities 
we may be required to expend greater than anticipated funds if unforeseen difficulties arise in the course of completing the development and marketing of our products or services or in other aspects of our business 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the development of new products and services on a timely basis  the receipt and timing of orders for our medication and supply dispensing systems  the cost of developing increased manufacturing and sales capacity  and the timely collection of accounts receivable 
as a result of the foregoing factors  it is possible that we will be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that this additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  if at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants that could affect our ability to pay dividends or raise additional capital 
our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
any deterioration in our relationship with commerce one would adversely affect our internet based procurement capabilities 
we have entered into an agreement with commerce one  inc  a provider of business to business technology solutions that link buyers and suppliers of goods and services to trading communities using the internet 
our agreement with commerce one enables us to implement a customized version of commerce one s buysite software at customer sites 
we cannot be sure that commerce one will not license its buysite technology to our competitors 
we cannot guarantee that commerce one will be able to develop and introduce enhancements to its products that keep pace with emerging technological developments and emerging industry standards 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that the commerce one network will not experience performance problems or delays 
the failure by commerce one in any of these areas could harm our internet based procurement capabilities 
government regulation of the healthcare industry could adversely affect demand for our products 
while the manufacture and sale of our current products are not regulated by the united states food and drug administration fda  we cannot assure you that these products  or our future products  if any  will not be regulated in the future 
a requirement for fda approval could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products 
pharmacies are regulated by individual state boards of pharmacy that issue rules for pharmacy licensure in their respective jurisdictions 
state boards of pharmacy do not license or approve our medication and supply dispensing systems  however  pharmacies using our equipment are subject to state board approval 
the failure of such pharmacies to meet differing requirements from a significant number of state boards of pharmacy could decrease demand for our products and harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
similarly  hospitals must be accredited by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations jcaho in order to be eligible for medicaid and medicare funds 
jcaho does not approve or accredit medication and supply dispensing systems  however  disapproval of our customers medication and supply dispensing management methods and their failure to meet jcaho requirements could decrease demand for our products and harm our competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
while we have implemented a privacy and use of information policy and strictly adhere to established privacy principles  use of customer information guidelines and federal and state statutes and regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality  we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
this legislation requires the secretary of health and human services hhs  to adopt national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in those transactions  to adopt standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information and to establish a schedule for implementing national health data privacy legislation or regulations 
in august of  hhs published final modifications to its privacy regulations that will take effect on april  these regulations restrict the use and disclosure of personally identifiable health information by our customers who are covered entities under hipaa 
because omnicell may be considered a business associate under hipaa  many of our customers have required that we enter into written agreements governing the way we handle any patient information we may encounter in providing our products and services 
in february of  hhs issued final security rules requiring covered entities to implement appropriate technical and physical safeguards of electronically transmitted personal health information by april of we cannot predict the potential impact of rules that have not yet been proposed or any other rules that might be finally adopted on our customers or on omnicell 
in addition  other federal and or state privacy legislation may be enacted at any time 
these laws and regulations could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain  use or disseminate patient information 
this could adversely affect demand for our products or force us to redesign our products in order to meet regulatory requirements 
our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones  and the occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster or any other catastrophic event could cause damage to our facilities and equipment  which could require us to cease or curtail operations 
our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes 
we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters  including tornadoes  fires  floods  power loss  communications failures and similar events including the effects of war or acts of terrorism 
if any disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be seriously or completely impaired or destroyed 
the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices 
that act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to rule proposals already made  and nasdaq has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
we expect these developments to increase our legal and accounting compliance costs  and to make some activities more difficult  such as stockholder approval of new option plans 
we expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result
