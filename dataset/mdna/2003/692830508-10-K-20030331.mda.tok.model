item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general critical accounting policies and estimates note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
certain of these accounting policies require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical data and experience  when available  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition the company records revenues upon shipment with related risks and title passing to the customers 
estimates of losses for bad debts  returns and other allowances are recorded at the time of the sale 
shipping charges to customers and related expenses that are included in selling  general and administrative expenses are immaterial 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that are believed to be uncollectible 
the company also records as an additional allowance a certain percentage of aged accounts receivable  based on historical experience and the company s assessment of the general financial conditions affecting its customer base 
if actual collections experience changes  revisions to the allowance may be required 
the company has a limited number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in the credit worthiness of any of these customers or in any other matters affecting the collectibility of amounts due from such customers could have a material affect on the company s results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
after all reasonable attempts to collect an account receivable have failed  the amount of the receivable is written off against the allowance 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
the inventory balance  which includes materials labor and manufacturing overhead costs  is recorded net of an allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
such allowance is based upon both historical experience and management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand 
if the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory significantly exceeds the estimated allowance  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net income would be significantly affected 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company s operational policy for the assessment and measurement of any impairment in the value of goodwill and other intangible assets that is other than temporary is to evaluate annually  with the help of independent third party appraisals  the recoverability and remaining life of its goodwill and other intangible assets to determine the fair value of these assets 
the methodologies to be used to estimate fair value include the use of estimates and assumptions  including projected revenues  earnings and cash flows 
if the fair value of any of these assets is determined to be less than its carrying value  the company will reflect the impairment of any such asset through a reduction in its carrying value  in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its appraised value 
long lived assets the company reviewed certain long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any of these assets may not be recoverable  the company will assess the recoverability of such assets based upon estimated undiscounted cash flow forecasts
