net sales to asian customers were for the year ended september  as compared to for the year ended september  gross profit increased  for the year ended september  gross profit percentage for the year ended september  was compared to for the prior year 
the increases and decreases in the gross profit are detailed below increase decrease due to increased sales  higher margins due to product mix  third quarter fiscal inventory obsolescence adjustment  effect of increased sales of lower margin oem products  due to increases in labor related and other costs  total increase in gross profit  the decrease in gross profit percentage of for the twelve months ended september  compared to the twelve months ended september  is as follows increase decrease higher margins due to product mix third quarter fiscal inventory reserve adjustment effect of increased sales of lower margin oem products labor related and other costs net decrease gross profit the improved gross profit percentage on assembled boards due to product mix was primarily caused by unit price reductions from our suppliers and subcontractors on our analog product lines and digital video satellite products  offset somewhat by sales of lower average margin set top box products 
oem sales of media center boards for the twelve months ended september  were  which accounted for of the net sales for fiscal although oem sales require less sales and marketing support  their gross profit percentages are substantially less than those of our retail products 
our oem sales had an average gross profit percentage of for the twelve months ended september  there were no significant oem sales in the previous year 
the increased product mix of oem sales during fiscal contributed to the reduction in our fiscal gross profit percentage when compared to the previous year 
during the latter part of fiscal  the factors below affected the realization of the company s inventory o the loss during the fourth quarter of of a long time direct corporate customer impacted the existing value of assembled boards and component inventory relating to this customer o a change with a major contract manufacturer from consigning component parts to the contract manufacturer to purchasing the assembled boards on a turnkey basis impacted the value of component inventory o the second consecutive year of declining sales resulted in slower sales of older models o engineering changes made to our usb and macintosh products which rendered certain inventory associated with this product obsolete o the better use of new software that assisted the company in identifying slow moving inventory with respect to the factors above  we deemed it necessary to increase our reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
an additional reserve of  was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal and charged to cost of sales 
during fiscal  there were certain assembled boards and component material inventory that we were able to sell through the use of a liquidation firm 
in recognition of this  we reduced our inventory reserve to reflect the decrease in the obsolete inventory value due to the liquidation of such products 
there was no similar obsolete inventory liquidation during fiscal  which resulted in a comparative reduction in our gross profit percentage between fiscal and fiscal for the twelve months ended september   the increase in the gross profit margin percentage of relating to labor related and other costs was due to the percentage increase in sales of for the twelve months ended september  over september  being in excess of the percentage increase in labor related and other costs of for the twelve months ended september  over september  the chart below illustrates the components of selling  general and administrative expenses twelve months ended september  dollar costs percentage of sales increase increase decrease decrease sales and marketing    technical support    general and administrative    total    selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by when compared to the twelve months ended september  the increase in sales and marketing expense of  which accounted for about of the total increase in aelling  general and administrative expenses  was mainly due to o higher advertising costs of  due to higher sales based co operative advertising  higher customer rebate realization and increased special promotions o higher advertising costs of  due to higher translated euro to u 
s dollar amounts due to the strengthening of the euro against the usd o higher commissions expense of  due to increased sales o increased sales commission expense of  due to higher translated euro to u 
s dollar amounts due to the strengthening of the euro against the usd o increased european sales office costs of  o increased european sales office costs of  due to higher translated euro to u 
s dollar amounts due to the strengthening of the euro against the usd o lower trade show costs of  due to smaller show presence and frequency the increase in general and administrative expenses of  was primarily due to o addition of senior executive officer  o higher legal costs of  o increased travel costs of  o increased directors fees of  o increased banking fees of  o increased consulting fees for investment advice and public relations research and development expenses increased  or approximately 
the increase was mainly due to higher compensation costs attributable to additional staff and increased material and contract services cost for product enhancements and new projects under development

non operational usd to euro currency re measurement we follow the rules prescribed in paragraph of sfas foreign currency translation  which states that accounts denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency need to be re measured into the entity s functional currency  and any gain or loss from this re measurement are included in the determination of net income 
re measurement gains and losses on inter company accounts that are of a long term investment nature and for which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future are excluded in determining net income and are reported in the same manner as are translation gains and losses 
since the functional currency of hauppauge digital europe sarl hde sarl is the euro  any asset  liability or equity accounts which are invested in or purchased using us dollars or great british pound by hde sarl are revalued into euros at the end of each period 
the gains or losses on hde sarl s books resulting from the revaluation of us dollar and great british pound accounts into euros are booked on the company s statement of operations in the other income loss section under the description non operational usd to euro currency re measurement 
re measurement gains and losses on inter company accounts that are of a long term investment nature and for which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future are booked as a component of translation gains and losses on the balance sheet under the stockholders equity section 
primarily due to a decrease in u 
s dollar denominated inventory on hde sarl s books  hde sarl experienced a net asset decrease for the year ended september  the increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar coupled with the decrease in net assets resulted in a re measurement gain of  for the year ended september  accumulated other comprehensive income loss the euro is the functional currency of the company s european subsidiary  hde sarl 
assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are translated to us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period  while equity accounts are translated to us dollars at the historical rate in effect at the date of the contribution 
operating results are translated to us dollars at the average prevailing exchange rate for the period  with the exception of sales which are translated to us dollars at the average monthly forward exchange contract rate 
the use of differing exchange rates results in foreign currency translation gains or losses 
since the euro accounts on hde sarl s books result in a net asset position total euro assets are in excess of euro liabilities  an increase in the euro value results in a deferred gain for the translation of euro accounts to us dollars 
the company had a translation loss of  recorded on the balance sheet as of september  for the year ended september   the company recorded in other comprehensive income deferred translation gains  resulting in a translation gain of  recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income as of september  the company uses forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in recognition of the sales decline from fiscal  slower sales of older product lines and engineering changes to products  we reviewed the net realizable value of our inventory as of september  we deemed it necessary to increase our reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory

since the functional currency of hauppauge digital europe sarl is the euro  any asset  liability or equity accounts which are invested in or purchased using us dollars by hauppauge digital europe us need to be revalued into euros at the end of each reporting period

in addition  our international sales  mostly in the european market  were  and of sales for the years ended september   and  respectively 
our fiscal fourth quarter sales july to september can be potentially impacted by the reduction of activity experienced in europe during the july and august summer holiday period 
to offset the above cycles  we target a wide range of customer types in order to moderate the seasonality of retail sales 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  working capital and stockholders equity position is disclosed below as of september  cash    working capital    stockholders equity    we had cash and cash equivalents as of september  of  an increase of  over september  the increase was due to sources of cash proceeds from employee stock purchase plan  decrease in income taxes receivable  decrease in inventories  increase in accounts payable other current liabilities  less cash used for net loss adjusted for non cash items  increase in accounts receivable  increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  purchases of fixed assets  purchase of treasury stock  net cash increase  net cash of  provided by operating activities was primarily due to a reduction in inventories and income taxes receivable of  and  respectively  plus an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of  offset by the net loss adjusted for non cash items of  an increase in accounts receivable of  and increases in prepaid assets and other current assets of  the decrease in inventories was due to an inventory reduction program instituted by the company in response to sluggish economic conditions 
the increase in accounts receivable was the result of an increase in sales for the three months ended september  over the three months ended september  in addition to a larger volume of component parts that our contract manufacturer purchased from us during september   due to an increase in our september and october production volume when compared to the same period of the prior year

on november   we approved a stock repurchase program 
the program  as amended  authorizes the company to repurchase up to  shares of our own stock 
we intend to use the repurchased shares for certain employee benefit programs 
on december   the stock repurchase program was extended by a resolution of our board of directors 
as of september   we held  treasury shares purchased for  at an average purchase price of approximately per share

future contractual obligations the following table shows the company s contractual obligations related to lease obligations as of september  payments due by period contractual obligations total year years operating lease obligations    critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
 which was recently released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the our financial statements o revenue recognition o management s estimates o hedging program for sales denominated in a foreign currency o translation of assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies on our european financial statements revenue recognition our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of computer boards which enable you to view television programs on your personal computer 
sales of computer boards are commonly classified as computer hardware 
our sales are primarily to retailers  distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
sales to our customers are documented by a purchase order which describes the conditions of sale 
sales are recorded when products are shipped to our customers  the product price is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 
revenue from freight charged to customers is recognized when products are shipped 
provisions for customer returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded based upon historical data 
management s estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to sales provisions  as described above  income taxes  bad debts  inventory allowances and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical data  when available  experience  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
hedging program for sales denominated in a foreign currency our european subsidiary accounts for approximately and of our net sales for fiscal and fiscal all of our european sales are denominated in local currencies  primarily the euro and great british pound 
as a result of this  we are a net receiver of currencies other than the u 
s dollar 
changes in the exchange rate subject us to market risks resulting from the fluctuation of the euro and great british pound to the us dollar 
in an attempt to minimize these risks  we enter into forward exchange contracts with financial institutions 
we do not enter into contracts for speculative purposes 
we enter into monthly window contracts covering an average period of six months based on existing or anticipated future purchases 
although we enter into these contracts to reduce the short term impact of currency rate changes  the following risks are still inherent in hedging the euro sales o actual sales may fluctuate from our estimates  resulting in contracts in excess of collections o short term volatility of currency markets has the potential to reduce the effectiveness of our hedging program o historical volatility of the euro has the potential to impact our revenues  gross margins and operating income o the magnitude of the success of our hedging program is dependent upon movements in the euro exchange rates 
these movements are difficult to predict over an extended period of time translation of assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies on our european financial statements the functional currency of our european subsidiary is the euro 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate assets and liabilities denominated in a non functional currency  mainly us dollars  to euros on the books of our european subsidiary 
this process results in exchange gains and losses depending on the changes in the euro to us dollar exchange rate 
under the relevant accounting guidance  we are obligated to include these gains and losses on our statement of operations  which we report in other income or expense under the caption non operational usd to euro currency re measurement 
the extent of these gains and losses can fluctuate greatly from month to month depending on the change in the exchange rate  causing results to vary widely 
due to the past volatility of the euro  it is difficult to forecast the long term trend of these gains and losses 
inflation while inflation has not had a material effect on our operations in the past  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to offset the effects of inflation on the costs of our products or services through price increases to our customers without experiencing a reduction in the demand for our products  or that inflation will not have an overall effect on the computer equipment market that would have a material affect on us 
euro on january   the euro was adopted in europe as the common legal currency among of the member countries of the european community 
on that date  the participating countries established fixed euro conversion rates ie the conversion exchange rate between their existing currencies and the euro 
the euro now trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
a new european central bank was established to direct monetary policy for the participating countries 
prior to the adoption of the euro  we billed our european customers in german marks or great british pound  depending upon which currency the customer preferred to be billed in 
effective january   we began invoicing our customers  who are located in the eleven member countries  in euros 
we continue to bill customers located in the united kingdom in great british pound 
the benefits to billing customers in euros were twofold o our foreign currency hedging program was streamlined to the euro and the great british pound o the pricing from country to country was harmonized  eliminating price differences between countries due to the fluctuating local currencies we handled the conversion to the euro without any material disruptions to our operations 
see item a market risk s 
derivatives and hedging activities due to extensive sales to european customers with payment made to us in those local currencies primarily the euro and great british pound and limited expenses paid in local currencies  we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar 
as such  we benefit from a weak dollar and are negatively affected by a strong dollar relative to the major worldwide currencies  especially the euro and great british pound 
consequently  changes in exchange rates expose us to market risks resulting from the fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates to the us dollar 
we attempt to reduce these risks by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with our foreign denominated sales 
although we do not try to hedge against all possible foreign currency exposures because we can not fully estimate the size of our exposure  the contracts we procure are specifically entered into to as a hedge against existing or anticipated foreign currency exposure 
we do not enter into contracts for speculative purposes 
although we maintain these programs to reduce the short term impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a long term strengthening position against the foreign currencies in countries where we sell our products  our revenues  gross margins  operating income and retained earnings can be adversely affected 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging program include the volatility of the currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments 
the strength or weakness of the us dollar against the euro and great british pound impacts our financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues  gross margins  operating income and retained earnings which are all expressed in us dollars 
we use derivatives to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge the foreign currency market exposures underlying forecasted sales transactions with customers 
as of september   we had foreign currency contracts outstanding of approximately  against the delivery of the euro 
the contracts expire through december our accounting policies for these instruments are based on the designation of such instruments as cash flow hedging transactions 
we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes 
we record all derivative gains and losses on the balance sheet as a component of stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as of september  and  a deferred loss of  and a deferred gain of  reflecting the net mark to market losses and gains of our derivatives  was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet 
for the year ended september   we recorded a decrease in sales of  related to our contracts that closed during this period and the changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts 
for the twelve months ended september   we recorded an decrease in sales of  related to our contracts that closed during this period and the changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures three classes of freestanding financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability 
sfas was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the company has not entered into any financial instruments within the scope of sfas since may   nor does it currently hold any significant financial instruments within its scope 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no  consolidation of variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
requires companies with a variable interest in a variable interest entity to apply this guidance as of the beginning of the first reporting period ending after december  the application of the guidance could result in the consolidation of a variable interest entity 
the only potential variable interest entity with which the company is associated is the real estate partnership owned by certain of the company s principal shareholders  as disclosed in note of the notice to consolidated financial statements 
the company is evaluating whether the partnership is a variable interest entity  whether the company is the primary beneficiary and  if so  the impact of this interpretation on its financial position and results of operations 
with respect to interpretation no 
 the company rents its principal office and warehouse space in hauppauge  new york from a real estate partnership owned by certain of the company s principal stockholders 
the lease term expires on january  and includes an option to extend for three additional years 
the lease provides for rent increases of per year 
rent is currently at the annual rate of  and will increase to  annually as of february  on december  in connection with a re negotiation of the lease term  the company granted options to purchase  shares to a real estate partnership partially owned by the principal stockholder at an exercise price of per share  which are exercisable through the lease term 
the market price of the option equaled the exercise price at the date of the grant 
the effect of imputing the fair value of the options granted was immaterial 
the options were still outstanding as of september  the company had amounts payable to this related party for unpaid rent of  as of september  and the indebtedness partially incurred by the principal stockholder to purchase the building is also guaranteed by the company and totaled  at september  risk factors if tv technology for the pc  or our implementation of this technology  is not accepted  we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 
our future success depends on the growing use and acceptance of tv and video applications for pcs 
the market for these applications is still evolving  and may not develop to the extent necessary to enable us to further expand our business 
we have invested  and continue to invest  significant time and resources in the development of new products for this market 
our o dependence on sales of tv and video products for the pc o lack of market diversification o lack of development of the market for our products o potential inability to remain ahead of the development of competing technologies could each have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we rely upon sales of a small number of product lines  and the failure of any one product line to be successful in the market could substantially reduce our sales 
we currently rely upon sales from our internal and external products to generate a majority of our sales 
while we continue to develop additional products within these and other product lines  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
consequently  if the existing or future products are not successful  sales could decline substantially  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we rely heavily on the success of dealers and oems to market  sell and distribute our products 
if these resellers do not succeed in effectively distributing our products  our sales could be reduced 
these resellers may not effectively promote or market our products or they may experience financial difficulties and even close operations 
these dealers and retailers are not contractually obligated to sell our products 
therefore  they may  at any time o refuse to promote our products and o discontinue the use of our products in favor of a competitor s product also  with this distribution channel standing between us and the actual end user  we may not be able to accurately gauge current demand and anticipate future demand for our products 
for example  dealers may place large initial orders for a new product just to keep their stores stocked with the newest products and not because there is a significant demand for them 
our distribution network includes several consumer channels  including large distributors of products to computer software and hardware retailers  which in turn sell products to end users 
they also sell consumer products directly to certain retailers 
rapid change and financial difficulties of distributors have characterized distribution channels for consumer retail products 
these arrangements have exposed us to the following risks  among others o we may be obligated to provide price protection to certain retailers and distributors and  while certain agreements limit the conditions under which products can be returned  we may be faced with product returns or price protection obligations o the distributors or retailers may not continue to stock and sell our products and o retailers and retail distributors often carry competing products if these resellers do not succeed in effectively distributing our products  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we operate in a highly competitive market  and many of our competitors have much greater resources  which may make it difficult for us to remain competitive 
our business is subject to significant competition 
competition exists from larger companies that possess substantially greater technical  financial  human  sales and marketing resources than we do 
the dynamics of competition in this market involve short product life cycles  declining selling prices  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
we compete against companies such as ati technologies inc and pinnacle systems  inc 
our new mediamvp tm and dec products compete in the consumer electronics market  where competition comes from sony corp  toshiba corporation  cisco systems inc and others 
we believe that competition from new entrants will increase as the market for digital video in a pc expands 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience increased competition in the future 
such increased competition may have a material adverse affect on our ability to successfully market our products 
competition is expected to remain intense and  as a result  we may lose some of our market share to our competitors 
further  we believe that the market for our products will continue to be price competitive and thus we could continue to experience lower selling prices  lower gross profit margins and reduced profitability levels for such products than in the past 
rapid technological changes and short product life cycles in our industry could harm our business 
the technology underlying our products and other products in the computer industry  in general  is subject to rapid change  including the potential introduction of new types of products and technologies  which may have a material adverse impact upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
we will need to maintain an ongoing research and development program  and our potential future success  of which there can be no assurances  will depend  in part  on our ability to respond quickly to technological advances by developing and introducing new products  successfully incorporating such advances in existing products  and obtaining licenses  patents  or other proprietary technologies to be used in connection with new or existing products 
we expended approximately   and  for research and development expenses for the years ended september   and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that our research and development will be successful or that we will be able to foresee and respond to such advances in technological developments and to successfully develop additional products 
additionally  there can be no assurances that the development of technologies and products by competitors will not render our products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
if tv or video capabilities are included in pcs or in operating systems  it could result in a reduction in the demand for add on tv and video devices 
although we believe that our software is a competitive strength  as operating systems such as windows move to integrate and standardize software support for video capabilities  we will be challenged to further differentiate our products 
our operating results and ability to retain our market share are also dependent on continued growth in the underlying markets for pc  tv and video products 
we may not be able to timely adopt emerging industry standards  which may make our products unacceptable to potential customers  delay our product introductions or increase our costs 
our products must comply with a number of current industry standards and practices established by various international bodies 
failure to comply with evolving standards  including video compression standards  tv transmission standards  and pc interface standards  will limit acceptance of our products by the market 
if new standards are adopted in the industry  we will be required to adopt those standards in our products 
it may take a significant amount of time to develop and design products incorporating these new standards  and we may not succeed in doing so 
we may also become dependent upon products developed by third parties and have to pay royalty fees  which may be substantial  to the developers of the technology that constitutes the newly adopted standards 
we are heavily dependent upon foreign markets for sales of our products  primarily the european market  and adverse changes in these markets could reduce our sales 
our future performance will likely be dependent  in large part  on our ability to continue to compete successfully in the european markets  where a large portion of our current and potential customers are located 
our ability to compete in these markets will depend on many factors  including o the economic conditions in these regions o the stability of the political environment in these regions o adverse changes in the relationships between major countries in these regions o the state of trade relations among these regions and the united states o restrictions on trade in these regions o the imposition or changing of tariffs by the countries in these regions on products of the type that we sell o changes in the regulatory environment in these regions o export restrictions and export license requirements o restrictions on the export of critical technology o our ability to develop pc tv products that meet the varied technical requirements of customers in each of these regions o our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with our foreign customers and distributors o changes in freight rates o our ability to enforce agreements and other rights in the countries in these regions o difficulties in staffing and managing international operations o difficulties assessing new and existing international markets and credit risks o potential insolvency of international customers and difficulty in collecting accounts if we are unable to address any of these factors  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are heavily dependent upon foreign manufacturing facilities for our products  primarily facilities in europe and asia  which exposes us to additional risks 
the majority of our products are built at contract manufacturing facilities in asia and europe 
our ability to successfully build products at overseas locations will depend on several factors  including o the economic conditions in these regions o the stability of the political environment in these regions o adverse changes in the relationships between major countries in these regions o the state of trade relations among these regions and the united states o restrictions on trade in these regions o the imposition or changing of tariffs by the countries in these regions on products of the type that we sell o changes in the regulatory environment in these regions o import restrictions and import license requirements o our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with our foreign manufacturers o changes in freight rates o difficulties in staffing and managing international operations o potential insolvency of vendors and difficulty in obtaining materials if we are unable to address any of these factors  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
foreign currency exchange fluctuations could adversely affect our results 
due to extensive sales to european customers with payment made to us in those local currencies primarily the euro and great british pound and limited expenses paid in local currencies  we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar 
as such  we benefit from a weak dollar and are negatively affected by a strong dollar relative to the major worldwide currencies  especially the euro and great british pound 
consequently  changes in exchange rates expose us to market risks resulting from the fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates to the us dollar 
we attempt to reduce these risks by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with our foreign denominated sales 
the strength or weakness of the us dollar against the euro and great british pound impacts our financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues  gross margins  operating income and retained earnings which are all expressed in us dollars 
we engage in hedging programs aimed at limiting  in part  the impact of currency fluctuations 
by selling foreign currency futures  we fix the rate of exchange at the time we enter into the contract 
we deliver these currencies to the financial institutions at a later date when we actually receive the foreign currency 
as of september   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding of approximately  against delivery of the euro 
the contracts expire through december for the years ended september  and  we had recorded in sales related to our contracts that closed during these periods and the changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts of  and  respectively 
although we do not try to hedge against all possible foreign currency exposures because we can not fully estimate the size of our exposure  the contracts we procure are specifically entered into as a hedge against existing or anticipated exposure 
we do not enter into contracts for speculative purposes 
although we maintain these programs to reduce the short term impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a long term strengthening position against the foreign currencies in countries where we sell our products  our revenues  gross margins  operating income and retained earnings can be adversely affected 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging program include volatility of the currency markets and availability of hedging instruments 
additionally  there is the risk that foreign exchange fluctuations will make our products less competitive in foreign markets  which would substantially reduce our sales 
we may be unable to develop new products that meet customer requirements in a timely manner 
our success is dependent on our ability to continue to introduce new products with advanced features  functionality and performance that our customers demand 
we may not be able to introduce new products on a timely basis  that are accepted by the market  and that sell in quantities sufficient to make the products viable for the long term 
sales of new products may negatively impact sales of existing products 
in addition  we may have difficulty establishing our products presence in markets where it does not currently have significant brand recognition 
we may experience declining margins 
we may experience declining gross margins due to the following factors  among others o changes in foreign currency exchange rates o larger sales mix of lower margin products o possible future allowances for excess inventory o increases in costs charged by contract manufacturers o increases in duty and tariff rates o increases in shipping costs o lower average selling prices o increases in material acquisition costs and o different gross margins for like products in different markets consequently  as margins may decline  our profitability will be more dependent upon effective cost management controls 
there can be no assurances that such cost and management controls can be implemented and maintained  and if implemented  that they will be successful 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  intense downward pricing pressure on our products  which could substantially impair our operating performance 
we are experiencing  and are likely to continue to experience  downward pricing pressure on our products 
as a result  we have experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  declining average sales prices for our products 
increases in the number of units that we are able to sell and reductions in per unit costs may not be sufficient to offset reductions in per unit sales prices  in which case our net income would be reduced and we could incur losses 
since we typically negotiate supply arrangements far in advance of delivery dates  we may need to commit to price reductions for our products before we are aware of how  or if  these cost reductions can be obtained 
as a result  any current or future price reduction commitments and our inability to respond to increased price competition could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent upon contract manufacturers for our production 
if these manufacturers do not meet our requirements  either in volume or quality  then we could be materially harmed 
during fiscal  we subcontracted the manufacturing and assembly of our products to three independent third parties at facilities in various countries 
relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks  including o loss of control over the manufacturing process o potential absence of adequate production capacity o potential delays in production lead times o unavailability of certain process technologies o reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality and costs  and o unexpected increases in component costs we may need to hold more inventory than is immediately required to compensate for potential manufacturing disruptions 
if our significant subcontractor becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these products in required volumes  we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors 
additional qualified subcontractors may not be available  or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis 
any interruption in the supply of  or increase in  the cost of the products manufactured by third party subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers for our components and assembled products 
if these suppliers do not meet the demand  either in volume or quality  then we could be materially harmed 
if the supply of a key component or assembled product such as the dec and wintv r dvb were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing or sole vendor delays shipment of such components or completed products  our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected 
our business  operating results and financial condition could also be adversely affected  depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or  if possible  to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source 
we attempt to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with our key suppliers on product introduction plans  strategic inventories  coordinated product introductions  and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels 
we are also seeking out alternative sources for assembled products  making us less dependent on a single or limited source 
we may need to hold more inventory than is immediately required to compensate for potential component shortages or discontinuation 
this could lead to an increase in the costs of manufacturing or assembling our products 
if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components or assembled products in required volumes  we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components 
additional sources may not be available  or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis 
any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components and assembled products provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may incur excessive expenses if we are unable to accurately forecast sales of our products 
we generally ship products within one to four weeks after receipt of orders 
therefore  our sales backlog is typically minimal 
accordingly  our expectations of future net sales and our product manufacturing and materials planning are based largely on our own estimates of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
if we obtain orders in excess of our internal forecasts  we may be unable to timely increase production to meet demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if our net sales do not meet expectations  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected  we may be burdened with excess inventory  and we may be subject to excess costs or inventory write offs 
we may experience a reduction in sales if we are unable to respond quickly to changes in the market for our products 
our net sales can be affected by changes in the quantity of products that our distributor and oem customers maintain in their inventories 
we may be directly and rapidly affected by changes in the market  including the impact of any slowdown or rapid increase in end user demand 
despite efforts to reduce distribution channel inventory exposure  distribution partners and oem customers may still choose to alter their inventory levels  which could cause a reduction in our net sales  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may accumulate inventory to minimize the impact of shortages from manufacturers and suppliers  which may result in obsolete inventory that we may need to write off resulting in losses 
managing our inventory is complicated by fluctuations in the demand for our products as well as the issues of using contract manufacturers and procuring components from suppliers mentioned above 
as we must plan to have sufficient quantities of products available to satisfy our customers demands  we sometimes accumulate inventory for a period of time to minimize the impact of possible insufficient capacity or availability of components from our manufacturers and suppliers 
although we expect to sell the inventory within a short period of time  products may remain in inventory for extended periods of time and may become obsolete because of the passage of time and the introduction of new products or new components within existing products 
in these situations  we would be required to write off obsolete inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may need financing  and may not be able to raise financing on favorable terms  if at all  which could limit our ability to grow and increase our costs 
we anticipate that we may need to raise additional capital in the future to continue our long term expansion plans  to respond to competitive pressures or to respond to unanticipated requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our failure or inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms could require us to limit our plans for expansion  incur indebtedness that has high rates of interest or substantial restrictive covenants  issue equity securities that will dilute existing stockholders holdings or discontinue a portion of our operations  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may become involved in costly intellectual property disputes 
with the proliferation of new products and rapidly changing technology  there is a significant volume of patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
there are a number of companies that hold patents for various aspects of the technologies incorporated in some of the pc and tv industries standards 
given the nature of our products and development efforts  there are risks that claims associated with such patents or intellectual property rights could be asserted by third parties against us 
we expect that parties seeking to gain competitive advantages will increase their efforts to enforce any patent or intellectual property rights that they may have 
the holders of patents from which we may have not obtained licenses may take the position that it is required to obtain a license from them 
if a patent holder refuses to offer such a license or offers such a license on terms unacceptable to us  there is a risk of incurring substantial litigation or settlement costs regardless of the merits of the allegations  or which party eventually prevails 
if we do not prevail in a litigation suit  we may be required to pay significant damages and or to cease sales and production of infringing products and accordingly  may incur significant defense costs 
additionally  we may need to attempt to design around a given technology  although there can be no assurances that this would be possible or economical 
we currently use technology licensed from third parties in certain products 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to these third party technologies  including o failure by a licensor to accurately develop  timely introduce  promote or support the technology o delays in shipment of products o excess customer support or product return costs due to problems with licensed technology  and o termination of our relationship with such licensors we may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property through patent  copyright  trademark and other means of protection 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  our intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others  invalidated or challenged  and our competitors could duplicate our technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technological advantage we may have 
due to the rapid pace of technological change  we believe our success is likely to depend more upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and service rather than upon legal protection of our proprietary rights 
however  we intend to aggressively assert our intellectual property rights when necessary 
even though we typically develop our products independently  our success  of which there can be no assurances  will depend  in a large part  on our ability to innovate  obtain or license patents  protect trade secrets  copyrights and trademarks  and draw upon our proprietary technology without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we maintain copyrights on our designs and software programs  but currently we have no patent on the wintv r board as we believe that such technology cannot be patented 
we have no patents issued or pending that relate to our technology 
we are subject to a number of risks relating to intellectual property rights  including the following o the means by which we seek to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent others from misappropriating our technology or from independently developing or selling technology or products with features based on or similar to our products o our products may be sold in foreign countries that provide less protection to intellectual property than is provided under us laws  and o our intellectual property rights may be challenged  invalidated  violated or circumvented and may not provide us with any competitive advantage we may not be able to attract and retain qualified managerial and other skilled personnel 
our success  of which there can be no assurances  depends  in part  on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified managerial  technical and sales personnel 
our success  of which there can be no assurances  is dependent on our ability to manage effectively the enhancement and introduction of existing and new products and the marketing of such products 
we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified managers  engineers and salespersons 
the loss of the services of a significant number of engineers or sales people or one or more senior officers or managers could be disruptive to product development efforts or business relationships and could seriously harm our business 
we depend on a limited number of key personnel  and the loss of any of their services could adversely affect our future growth and profitability and could substantially interfere with our operations 
our products are complex and our market is evolving 
the success of our business depends in large part upon the continuing contributions of our management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key officers or employees could adversely affect our future growth and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our dependence upon our key officers and employees is increased by the fact that they are responsible for our sales and marketing efforts  as well as our overall operations 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees other than mr 
plotkin  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer and the insurance coverage that we have on him may be insufficient to compensate us for the loss of his services 
we may not be able to effectively integrate businesses or assets that we acquire we may identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets  such as customer bases  products and technology 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities 
if any such opportunity involves the acquisition of a business  we cannot be certain that o we will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own o all the benefits expected from such integration will be realized o management s attention will not be diverted or divided  to the detriment of current operations o amortization of acquired intangible assets will not have a negative effect on operating results or other aspects of our business o delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental effect on the combined business  operating results and financial condition o customer dissatisfaction with  or performance problems at  an acquired company will not have an adverse effect on our reputation  and o respective operations  management and personnel will be compatible in most cases  acquisitions will be consummated without seeking and obtaining stockholder approval  in which case stockholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition 
although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular acquisition  there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks 
our products could contain defects  which could result in delays in recognition of sales  loss of sales  loss of market share  or failure to achieve market acceptance  or claims against us 
we develop complex products for tv and video processing 
despite testing by our engineers  subcontractors and customers  errors may be found in existing or future products 
this could result in  among other things  a delay in recognition of sales  loss of sales  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance or substantial damage to our reputation 
we could be subject to material claims by customers  and may need to incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects 
we do not have product liability insurance to protect against losses caused by defects in our products  and we also do not have errors and omissions insurance 
as a result  any payments that we may need to make to satisfy our customers may be substantial and may result in a substantial charge to earnings 
we may experience fluctuations in our future operating results  which will make predicting our future results difficult 
historically  our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly from period to period  and we expect that our results will continue to do so 
these fluctuations result from a variety of factors  including o market acceptance of our products o changes in order flow from our customers  and their inability to forecast their needs accurately o the timing of our new product announcements and of announcements by our competitors o increased competition  including changes in pricing by us and our competitors o delays in deliveries from our limited number of suppliers and subcontractors  and o difficulty in implementing effective cost management constraints as our sales are primarily to the consumer market  we have experienced certain seasonal revenue trends 
our peak sales quarter  due to holiday season sales of computer equipment  is our first fiscal quarter october to december  followed by our second fiscal quarter january to march 
in addition  our international sales  mostly in the european market  were  and of sales for the years ended september   and  respectively 
our fiscal fourth quarter sales july to september can be potentially impacted by the reduction of activity experienced in europe during the july and august summer holiday period 
accordingly  any sales or net income in any particular period may be lower than the sales and net income in a preceding or comparable period 
period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful  and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future periods 
failure to meet such expectations  should such an event occur  will likely cause our share price to decline 
our common stock price is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  subject to a high degree of volatility 
numerous factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including o general conditions in the pc and tv industries o product pricing o new product introductions o market growth forecasts o technological innovations o mergers and acquisitions o announcements of quarterly operating results o overall us and worldwide economic health o stability of the us and worldwide securities markets in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price volatility and broad market fluctuations in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market price of securities issued by many high technology companies in many cases for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
the price of our common stock has experienced volatility not necessarily related to our performance 
the company s amended and restated by laws and the rights agreement in which the company is party to may have anti takeover effects  limiting the ability of outside stockholders to seek control of management  and any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay may be reduced and any merger or takeover may be delayed 
effective august   the board of directors unanimously approved amended and restated by laws for the company the by laws 
the by laws do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and consequently  an expensive proxy contest cannot occur other than in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders 
the by laws also impose strict requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of prospective board members other than those nominated by or at the discretion of the board of directors 
these amendments may collectively or individually impact a person s decision to purchase voting securities in the company and may have anti takeover effects in that any merger or takeover may be delayed 
accordingly  any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay may be reduced 
on july   the board of directors declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of the company s common shares to stockholders of record at the close of business on august  each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the company one common share at a purchase price of per share  subject to adjustment and terms set out in the rights agreement between the company and north american transfer agent  as rights agent 
the rights may have certain anti takeover effects 
the rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the company in a manner which causes the rights to become discount rights unless the offer is conditional on a substantial number of rights being acquired 
accordingly  any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay may be reduced 
no dividends and none anticipated 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not contemplate or anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
it is currently anticipated that earnings  if any  will be used to finance the development and expansion of the business 
from time to time  information provided by us  statements made by our employees or information provided in our securities and exchange commission filings  including information contained in this annual report on form k  may contain forward looking information 
our actual future results may differ materially from those projections or statements made in such forward looking information as a result of various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  rapid changes in technology  lack of funds for research and development  competition  proprietary patents and rights of others  loss of major customers  loss of sources of supply for our components  non availability of management  government regulation  currency fluctuations and our inability to profitably sell our products 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile at times in response to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  market conditions in the computer hardware industry  seasonality of the business cycle  as well as general conditions and other external factors 
item a 
market risk s due to extensive sales to european customers with payment made to us in those local currencies primarily the euro and great british pound and limited expenses paid in local currencies  we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar 
as such  we benefit from a weak dollar and are negatively affected by a strong dollar relative to the major worldwide currencies  especially the euro and great british pound 
consequently  changes in exchange rates expose us to market risks resulting from the fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates to the us dollar 
we attempt to reduce these risks by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with our foreign denominated sales 
the strength or weakness of the us dollar against the euro and great british pound impacts our financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues  gross margins  operating income and retained earnings which are all expressed in us dollars 
we engage in hedging programs aimed at limiting  in part  the impact of currency fluctuations 
by selling foreign currency futures  we fix the rate of exchange at the time we enter into the contract 
we deliver these currencies to the financial institutions at a later date when we actually receive the foreign currency 
for the years ended september  and  respectively  we recorded approximately  and  as a decrease to net sales related to the changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts 
although we do not try to hedge against all possible foreign currency exposures because we can not fully estimate the size of our exposure  the contracts we procure are specifically entered into to as a hedge against existing or anticipated exposure 
we do not enter into contracts for speculative purposes 
although we maintain these programs to reduce the short term impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a long term strengthening position against the foreign currencies in countries where we sell our products  our revenues  gross margins  operating income and retained earnings can be adversely affected 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging program include volatility of the currency markets and availability of hedging instruments
