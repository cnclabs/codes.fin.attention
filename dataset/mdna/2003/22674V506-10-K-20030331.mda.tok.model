during we evaluated our various products  services  facilities and the business plan under which we were operating 
in connection with this review  we implemented and substantially completed a strategic restructuring plan that involved reorganizing and refocusing critical path s product and service offerings  a reduction in workforce and a facilities and operations consolidation 
additionally  we implemented an aggressive expense management plan to further reduce operating costs 
at the end of  we had divested all of the products and services deemed to be non core to our continued operations  reduced headcount by  reduced the number of facilities by and implemented other cost cutting measures  resulting in a significant reduction in overall operating expenses 
in may  we approved a restructuring plan to reduce our expense levels to be consistent with the then current business climate 
in connection with the plan  a restructuring charge of million was recognized in the second quarter of this charge was comprised of approximately million in severance and related 
table of contents costs associated with the elimination of approximately positions and  in facilities lease termination costs 
most recently  in january  we announced a restructuring initiative designed to further reduce our expense level in an effort to achieve operating profitability assuming limited revenue growth 
the cost reduction plan targets reduced operating expenses  excluding special charges  amortization and depreciation  of approximately million annually 
quarterly operating expenses are expected to be  excluding special charges  amortization and depreciation  approximately million to million by mid year the plan includes the consolidation of some office locations and a global workforce reduction of approximately positions  or approximately of the workforce 
the headcount reduction is partially offset by outsourcing approximately positions to lower cost service providers 
we anticipate an aggregate charge of approximately million resulting from the cost reduction plan  inclusive of cash and non cash expenses 
we expect to incur the charge through the first half of in addition to these formal restructuring initiatives  we have sought aggressively to manage our cost structure throughout and  identifying incremental savings where possible 
we intend to continue to aggressively manage our expenses in  while maintaining strong service levels to our customers 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  inclusive of a billion charge for impairment of long lived assets recorded in the fourth quarter of we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing  development of our technology and solution offerings  and related enhancements 
we may continue to incur operating losses through the end of  however  we do not anticipate the need for additional financing prior to december  in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business  prior acquisitions  organizational restructuring and limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of revenues and operating results  including gross profit margin and operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues  are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
at december   we had employees  as compared to employees at december  and  employees at december  we do not believe that our historical trends for revenues  expenses or personnel are indicative of future results 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements and results of operations  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we believe the following are the most critical accounting policies underlying our presentation of our financial condition and related operating results revenue recognition  valuation and impairment of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets  estimating allowance for doubtful accounts and contingencies  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived from four primary sources software license sales  professional services  maintenance and support and hosted messaging services 
revenues are recognized once the related products or services have been delivered and collection of associated fees is considered probable 
software license revenues are generated from the sale of our messaging and identity management products under perpetual and term licenses 
software license revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the licensed software to the customer has occurred and the collection of a fixed or determinable license fee is considered probable 
our revenue recognition policies require that revenues recognized from software arrangements be allocated to each undelivered element of the 
table of contents arrangement based on the fair values of the elements  such as post contract customer support  installation  training or other services 
professional service revenues are generated from fees primarily related to training  installation and configuration services associated with implementing and maintaining our license software products for our customers 
professional service revenues are recognized in the period in which the services are performed 
maintenance and support service revenues are generated from fees for post contract customer support agreements associated primarily with our software license products 
maintenance services typically include rights to future update and upgrade product releases and dial up phone services and the associated fees are typically paid up front by the customer  deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the support contract  which is generally one year 
we also enter into arrangements that include multiple products and services where the services are deemed essential to the functionality of a delivered element  under such circumstances we recognize the entire arrangement fee using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  individual contract revenues are recorded based on the percentage relationship of the contract costs incurred as compared to management s estimate of the total cost to complete the contract 
we also sell our license software products through resellers 
revenues from reseller agreements may include a nonrefundable  advance royalty which is payable upon the signing of the contract and license fees based on the contracted value of our products purchased by the reseller 
additionally  revenues from reseller agreements may include nonrefundable fees related to software license products and related services for an identified customer of the reseller 
guaranteed license fees from resellers  where no right of return exists  are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the licensed software has occurred and the collection of a fixed or determinable license fee is considered probable 
non guaranteed per copy license fees from resellers are initially deferred and are recognized when they are reported as sold to end users by the reseller 
hosted messaging revenues are generated from fees for hosting services we offer related to our messaging and collaboration solutions  including but not limited to email  calendar  reserve and news groups 
these are primarily based upon monthly contractual per unit rates for the services involved  which are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract beginning with the month in which service delivery starts 
amounts billed or received in advance of service delivery  including branding and set up fees  are initially deferred and subsequently recognized on a ratable basis over the expected term of the relationship beginning with the month in which service delivery starts 
valuation and impairment of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized whenever the evaluation demonstrates that the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable 
in connection with the impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of  the estimates of fair values were based upon the discounted estimated cash flows of critical path for the succeeding three years using a discount rate of and estimated terminal value 
the assumptions supporting the estimated cash flows  including the discount rate and an estimated terminal value  reflect management s best estimates 
the discount rate was primarily based upon the weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies 
during and in connection with our strategic restructuring effort  an additional assessment of impairment was performed on certain of our remaining long lived assets 
the restructuring plan identified and formulated a plan to exit certain products and services that were determined to be non core to critical path s business strategy 
we reviewed the intangible assets related to these non core products and services and  as a result of the assessment  recorded an impairment charge to these assets in the second quarter 
additionally during the fourth quarter of  we performed an evaluation of long lived assets within our core business 
as a result of this assessment we recorded a further impairment charge 
this charge resulted from an impairment of assets associated with our core business  primarily the hosted messaging services  as we determined that we had excess capacity and equipment related to certain core products and services 
no impairment charge was recorded in 
table of contents estimating allowance for doubtful accounts and contingencies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
for this reason  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management must make estimates surrounding their ability to collect revenues and related accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical and current economic trends  previous bad debts  customer concentrations  credit worthiness of customers  and payment terms of customer accounts  when evaluating adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
management estimates liabilities and contingencies at the end of each period 
the current financial statement presentation reflects management s best estimates of liabilities and pending litigation which are probable and where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record the minimum liability related to those claims where there is a range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to the probability of loss and the amount and range of loss on the pending litigation  management may not be able to make an accurate estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will continue to assess the potential exposure related to our pending litigation and update our estimates and related disclosures 
such future revisions in our estimates could materially impact our financial results 
stock based compensation our stock based employee compensation plans are described more fully in note of notes to consolidated financial statements shareholders equity deficit 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net loss  as some options granted under those plans had an exercise price less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  which is described more fully in note of notes to consolidated financial statements shareholders equity deficit 
we amortize stock based compensation using the straight line method over the remaining vesting periods of the related options  which is generally four years 
pro forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share is required 
this information is required to be determined as if we had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
the fair value of options and shares issued pursuant to the option plans at the grant date were estimated using the black scholes model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
we use projected volatility rates  which are based upon historical volatility rates trended into future years 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our options 

table of contents the following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 to stock based employee compensation 
year ended december in thousands  except per share amounts net loss attributable to common shares as reported add unearned stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss attributable to common shares  net of related tax effects deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under a fair value based method for all grants  net of related tax effects net loss attributable to common shares pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common shares as reported basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common shares pro forma the effects of applying pro forma disclosures of net loss and net loss per share are not likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on net loss and net loss per share in the future years  as the number of future shares to be issued under these plans is not known and the assumptions used to determine the fair value can vary significantly 
results of operations the following table presents our net revenues and selected cost of net revenues data during  and and the relative composition of net revenues and the selected cost of net revenues data as a percentage of net revenues during  and percentage of total historical amounts net revenues in thousands period ended december  net revenues software license hosted messaging professional services maintenance and support percentage of related net revenues selected cost of net revenues software license hosted messaging professional services maintenance and support 
table of contents net revenues software license

uncertainty surrounding our prospects and viability in the first half of caused a number of existing and potential customers to delay purchasing decisions

during the second half of and first half of  we restructured our business  reorganized our management team  and endeavored to rebuild customer confidence in us 
software license revenues in decreased million from due primarily to this uncertainty exacerbated by unfavorable macroeconomic conditions  which caused further delays in information technology spending

in december  an independent audit was completed and the results were presented to sun microsystems 
we will not recognize royalty revenues from sun microsystems until we come to a mutual agreement on current and historic contractual obligations  however  based on the findings of the independent audit  we expect that any impact to revenue will be insignificant 
during the second  third and fourth quarters of we excluded all royalty revenues earned from sun microsystems  inc hosted messaging

table of contents additional factors that may affect future operating results due to our limited operating history  evolving business strategy and the nature of the messaging and directory infrastructure market  our future revenues are unpredictable and our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
we cannot accurately forecast our revenues as a result of our limited operating history  evolving business strategy and the emerging nature of the internet messaging infrastructure market 
forecasting is further complicated by rapid changes in our business due to integration of acquisitions we completed in and  our recent strategic and operational restructuring  as well as significant fluctuations in license revenues as a percentage of total revenues from an insignificant percentage in  to in  in and in our revenues in some past quarters fell and could continue to fall short of expectations if we experience delays or cancellations of even a small number of orders 
we often offer volume based pricing  which may affect operating margins 
a number of factors are likely to cause fluctuations in operating results  including  but not limited to the demand for licensed solutions for messaging  directory  and other products  the demand for outsourced messaging services generally and the use of messaging and directory infrastructure products and services in particular  our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain customer satisfaction  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with industry expertise  particularly sales personnel  the ability to upgrade  develop and maintain our systems and infrastructure and to effectively respond to the rapid technology change of the messaging and directory infrastructure market  the budgeting and payment cycles of our customers and potential customers  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of business and infrastructure  our ability to quickly handle and alleviate technical difficulties or system outages  the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced services by competitors  and general economic and market conditions and their affect on our operations and the operations of our customers 
in addition to the factors set forth above  operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by the extent to which we incur non cash charges associated with stock based arrangements with employees and non employees 
in particular  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial non cash charges associated with the grant of stock options to employees and non employees and the grant of warrants to investors and other parties with whom we have business relationships 
these grants of options and warrants also may be dilutive to existing shareholders 
in addition  our operating results have been affected and could continue to be impacted by the elimination of product or service offerings through termination  sale or other disposition 
future decisions to eliminate  revise or limit any other offerings of a product or service would involve other factors affecting operational results including the expenditure of capital  the realization of losses  further reductions in our workforce  facility consolidation or the elimination of revenues along with the associated costs  any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
as a result of the foregoing  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of operating results are a good indication of future performance 
it is likely that operating results in some quarters will be below market expectations 
in this event  the price of our common stock is likely to prove volatile and or subject to further declines 

table of contents if we fail to improve our sales and marketing results  we may be unable to grow our business  which would negatively impact our operating results 
our ability to increase revenues will depend on our ability to continue to successfully recruit  train and retain experienced and effective sales and marketing personnel and to achieve results once employed with us 
competition for experienced and effective personnel in certain markets is intense and we may not be able to hire and retain personnel with relevant experience 
the complexity and implementation of our messaging and directory infrastructure products and services require highly trained sales and marketing personnel to educate prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our services 
current and prospective customers  in turn  must be able to educate their end users 
any delays or difficulties encountered in our staffing and training efforts would impair our ability to attract new customers and enhance our relationships with existing customers  and ultimately  grow revenues 
this would also adversely impact the timing and extent of our revenues from quarter to quarter and overall or could jeopardize sales altogether 
because we have experienced turnover in our sales force and have fewer resources than many of our competitors  our sales and marketing organizations may not be able to compete successfully against the sales and marketing organizations of our competitors 
moreover  our competitors frequently have larger and more established sales forces calling upon potential enterprise customers with more frequency 
in addition  certain of our competitors have longer and closer relationships with the senior management of enterprise customers who decide whose technologies and solutions to deploy 
if we do not successfully operate and grow our sales and marketing activities  our business and results of operations could suffer and the price of our common stock could continue to decline 
we have a history of losses  expect continuing losses and may never achieve profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit  including other comprehensive income  of approximately billion 
we have not achieved profitability in any period and expect to continue to incur net losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for the foreseeable future 
however  we will continue to spend resources on maintaining and strengthening our business  and this may  in the near term  have a negative effect on our operating results and our financial condition 
in past quarters  we have spent heavily on technology and infrastructure development 
we may continue to spend substantial financial and other resources to develop and introduce new end to end messaging and directory infrastructure solutions  and to improve our sales and marketing organizations  strategic relationships and operating infrastructure 
we expect that our cost of revenues  sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  operations and customer support expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses could continue to increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percent of revenues 
in addition  in future periods we will continue to incur significant non cash charges related to the ten acquisitions we completed in and and related stock based compensation 
if revenues do not correspondingly increase  our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
if we continue to incur net losses in future periods  we may not be able to retain employees  or fund investments in capital equipment  sales and marketing programs  and research and development to successfully compete against our competitors 
we may never obtain sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability in the future 
this may also  in turn  cause the price of our common stock to demonstrate volatility and or continue to decline 
we have experienced significant turnover of senior management and our executive management team has been together for a limited time  which could harm our business and operations 
throughout and  we announced a series of changes in our management that included the departure of many senior executives and also made changes in our board of directors 
a majority of the board of directors and senior executives of the company joined us in and we have made additional changes in recent months to our senior management team due to a variety of factors 
because of these changes and recent recruitment  our management team has not worked together as a group for a significant length of time and may not be able to work together effectively to successfully execute on revenue goals  implement our strategies and manage our operations 
if our management team is unable to accomplish our business objectives  our ability to grow our business and successfully meet operational challenges could be severely 
table of contents impaired 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our executive officers 
it is possible that this high turnover at our senior management levels may also continue for a variety of reasons 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key senior executive officers could harm our business and affect our ability to successfully implement our business objectives 
we depend on strategic relationships and the loss of any key strategic relationships could harm our business and negatively affect our revenues 
we depend on strategic relationships to expand distribution channels and opportunities and to undertake joint product development and marketing efforts 
our ability to increase revenues depends upon aggressively marketing our services through new and existing strategic relationships 
in the third quarter  we entered into certain partnership agreements in our hosted messaging business with the hewlett packard company for the development and marketing of a complete managed messaging solution 
in coming quarters we will be investing heavily in this relationship and making changes in our operations  including outsourcing our data operations  to accommodate the integration of this partnership 
to the extent this integration does not proceed as anticipated or the anticipated benefits of this partnership are not borne out  our business and results may be harmed 
in addition  if service levels are not adequate in connection with the outsourcing of our data centers  our customers may terminate agreements and our business will suffer 
we have also invested heavily and continue to invest in this model of hosted services operations 
to the extent this strategic decision and the business relationships surrounding its execution do not prove profitable and productive  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
we also depend on a broad acceptance of our software and outsourced messaging services on the part of potential resellers and partners and our acceptance as a supplier of outsourced messaging solutions 
we also depend on joint marketing and product development through strategic relationships to achieve further market acceptance and brand recognition 
our agreements with strategic partners typically do not restrict them from introducing competing services 
these agreements typically are for terms of one to three years  and automatically renew for additional one year periods unless either party gives prior notice of its intention to terminate the agreement 
in addition  these agreements are terminable by our partners without cause  and some agreements are terminable by us  upon a period of to days notice 
most of the agreements also provide for the partial refund of fees paid or other monetary penalties in the event that our services fail to meet defined minimum performance standards 
distribution partners may choose not to renew existing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition to strategic relationships  we also depend on the ability of our customers to aggressively sell and market our services to their end users 
if we lose any strategic relationships  fail to renew these agreements or relationships  fail to fully exploit our relationships  or fail to develop new strategic relationships  our business and financial results will suffer  and could have an adverse impact on our current and future revenues 
a limited number of customers account for a high percentage of our revenues and if we lose a major customer or are unable to attract new customers  revenues could decline 
we expect that sales of our products and services to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our future success depends on our ability to retain our current customers  and to attract new customers  in our target markets 
the loss of one or several major customers  whether through termination of agreements  acquisitions or bankruptcy  could harm our business 
our agreements with our customers typically have terms of one to three years often with automatic one year renewals and can be terminated without cause upon certain notice periods that vary among our agreements and range from a period of thirty to days notice 
in addition  a number of our customers  particularly for our hosted services business and in the technology industry  have also suffered from falling revenue  job losses  restructuring and decreased technology spending in the recent economic downturn 
especially in the telecommunications industry  which represents a sizeable portion of our customer base  the relative financial performance of our customers will continue to impact our sales cycles and ability to attract new business 
if our customers terminate their agreements for any reason before the end of the contract term  the loss of the customer could have an adverse impact on our current and future revenues 
also  if we are unable to enter into agreements with new customers and develop business with our existing customers  our business will not grow and we will not generate additional revenues 

table of contents if we are unable to successfully compete in our product market  our operating results could be harmed 
because we have a variety of messaging and directory infrastructure products and services  we encounter different competitors at each level of our products and services 
our primary competitors for service providers seeking insourced or outsourced product based solutions are sun microsystems iplanet and openwave systems  inc  mirapoint  inc  oracle corporation  microsoft corporation and ibm corporation s lotus division 
for secure delivery services  our competitors include tumbleweed communications corp 
for product based solutions and slamdunk networks for service based solutions  as well as atabok inc and zixit corporation 
in the enterprise ebusiness directory category  we compete primarily with iplanet  microsoft corporation and novell corporation  and our competitors in the meta directory market are iplanet  microsoft  novell and siemens corporation 
our competitors for corporate customers seeking outsourced hosted messaging solutions are email service providers  such as commtouch  easylink services corporation formerly mail 
com  usa 
net and application service providers who offer hosted exchange services 
we believe that some of the competitive factors affecting the market for messaging and directory infrastructure solutions include breadth of platform features and functionality of our offerings and the sophistication  innovation of competitors  total cost of ownership and operation  scalability  reliability  performance  and ease of expansion and upgrade  ease of integration to customers existing system  and flexibility to enable customers to manage certain aspects of their systems internally and leverage outsourced services in other cases when resources  costs and time to market reasons favor an outsourced offering 
we believe competition will continue to be fierce and further increase as current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do and may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger  more established and better financed companies 
any delay in our development and delivery of new services or enhancement of existing services would allow our competitors additional time to improve their service or product offerings  and provide time for new competitors to develop and market messaging and directory infrastructure products and services and solicit prospective customers within our target markets 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced operating margins and loss of market share  any of which could cause our business to suffer 
we may not be able to respond to the rapid technological change of the messaging and directory infrastructure industry 
the messaging directory infrastructure industry is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences  and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing services  proprietary technology and systems obsolete 
we must continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our services  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to enhance our existing email and messaging services and to develop new services  functionality and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective customers 
if we do not properly identify the feature preferences of prospective customers  or if we fail to deliver email features that meet the standards of these customers  our ability to market our service successfully and to increase revenues could be impaired 
the development of proprietary technology and necessary service enhancements entails significant technical and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead time 
we may not be able to keep pace with the latest technological developments 
we may also be unable to use new technologies effectively or adapt services to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 

table of contents our sales cycle is lengthy  has lengthened in recent quarters  and our results could be harmed by delays or cancellations in orders 
because we sell complex and sophisticated technology  our sales cycle  in particular with respect to our software solutions  can be long and unpredictable  often taking between two to twelve months 
because of the nature of our product and service offerings it can take many months of customer education and product evaluation before a purchase decision is made 
in addition  many factors can influence the decision to purchase our product and service offerings including budgetary restraints and decreases in capital expenditures  quarterly fluctuations in operating results of customers and potential customers  the emerging and evolving nature of the internet based services and wireless services markets 
furthermore  general global economic conditions  and weakness in global securities markets  continuing recessionary spending levels  and a protracted slowdown in technology spending in particular  have further lengthened and affected our sales cycle 
such factors have led to and could continue to lead to delays and postponements in purchasing decisions and in many cases cancellations of anticipated orders 
any delay or cancellation in sales of our products or services could cause our operating results to differ from those projected and cause our stock price to decline 
our preferred stock carries a liquidation preference and conversion would mean substantial dilution  which could significantly impact return to common equity holders upon an acquisition and a decline in the market price of our common stock in december  we issued  shares of series d cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock  and additional warrants  in a private placement to certain investors 
the shares of series d preferred stock have an aggregate liquidation preference of million 
the shares of series d preferred stock was convertible as of december  into common stock including all accreted amounts at an aggregate conversion price of million and were convertible into million shares of common stock 
to the extent the series d preferred stock is converted into common stock  a very significant number of additional shares of common stock may be sold into the market  which could decrease the price of our common stock 
in the event of a liquidation  dissolution or winding up of critical path  the holders of series d preferred stock would be entitled to receive a liquidation value as of december  of between million and million depending on the per share value in connection with the event 
in the event that we were to enter into a merger or sale in which the total value of the transaction would be less than the then current liquidation value of each preferred share  a buyer would unlikely be willing to assume the liquidation preferences and other obligations represented by the series d preferred stock 
consequently  we currently anticipate that any transaction resulting in the sale of all of substantially all of the shares of critical path would result in substantially all of the proceeds of such transaction being distributed to the holders of our series d preferred stock 
we may need to raise additional capital and to initiate other operational strategies that may dilute existing shareholders 
we believe that existing capital resources will enable us to maintain current and planned operations through at least december  however  additional capital may be required to continue operations and achieve profitability 
in addition  we may be required to raise additional funds due to unforeseen circumstances and market conditions 
if our capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned  we may require additional financing even sooner than anticipated 
such financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing shareholders 
additionally  we face a number of challenges in operating our business  including but not limited to the resources to maintain worldwide operations  continued sluggishness in technology spending  and significant contingent liabilities associated with litigation 
in the event that resolution of these or other operational matters involve issuance of stock or other derivative instruments  our existing shareholders may experience significant dilution 

table of contents pending litigation could harm relationships with existing or potential strategic partners and customers  and divert management s attention  either of which could harm our business 
in recent years  we have had filed a number of lawsuits against us  including securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation filed in february and august  and certain of our former officers and directors and some of our subsidiaries  as well as other lawsuits related to acquisitions  employee terminations and copyright infringement 
while these lawsuits vary greatly in the materiality of potential liability associated with them and many have been settled or withdrawn  the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved lawsuits could seriously harm our business  financial condition and reputation  whether material individually or in the aggregate 
in particular  this uncertainty could harm our relationships with existing customers  our ability to obtain new customers and our ability to operate certain aspects of our business 
the continued defense of the lawsuits also could result in continued diversion of our management s time and attention away from business operations  which could harm our business 
negative developments with respect to some of these lawsuits could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 
in addition  although we are unable to determine the amount  if any  that we may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of each of these lawsuits by settlement or otherwise  the size of any such payments  individually or in the aggregate  could seriously harm our financial condition 
many of the complaints associated with these lawsuits do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred as a result of the lawsuits 
while we maintain customary business insurance coverage  in some cases we have not set aside financial reserves relating to potential damages associated with some of these lawsuits 
failure to resolve pending securities claims and other material lawsuits could significantly harm our business 
although the company reached and the court approved settlement agreements in connection with the securities class action pending in the us district court for the northern district of california  a number of plaintiffs associated with the acquisition of peer logic  inc opted out of such settlement 
the case against the company with respect to these plaintiffs continues in the southern district of new york 
in addition  the company is a defendant in a number of securities class action lawsuits filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york  alleging that prospectuses under which securities were sold contained false and misleading statements with respect to discounts and commissions received by underwriters 
should these lawsuits linger for a long period of time  whether resolved in the company s favor or not  or further lawsuits be filed against us there can be no assurance that fees and expenses  and any ultimate resolution associated with such litigation  will be within the coverage limits of our insurance and or our ability to pay such amounts 
likewise  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to conclude or settle such litigation on terms that coincide with the coverage limits of our insurance and or ability to pay upon any final determination 
a failure to definitively resolve material litigation in which the company is involved or in which it may become involved in the future  regardless of the merits of the respective cases  could also cast doubt as to the prospects of the company in the eyes of our customers  potential customers and investors  and cause the company s stock price to further decline 
although concluded without monetary penalties to the company  lingering effects of the recent sec investigation could harm our business 
in  the sec investigated the company and certain of its former officers and directors related to non specified accounting matters  financial reports  other public disclosures and trading activity in our stock 
in february  the sec concluded the investigation as to the company 
although the sec did not impose any financial or criminal penalties against the company  we consented  without admitting or denying liability  to a cease and desist order and an administrative order for violation of certain non fraud provisions of the federal securities laws 
in addition  since then the sec and the department of justice charged five former employees of the company with various violations of the securities laws 
we believe that the investigation continues with respect to a number of other former executives and employees of the company and expect that such investigation may result in further charges against former employees although we do not know the status 
table of contents of such investigation 
despite the conclusion of the investigation of the company  lingering concerns about the actions leading up to the restatement of financials for the third quarter of have nevertheless cast doubt on the future of the company in the eyes of customers and investors 
in addition  a number of recent arrests  allegations and investigations in connection with accounting improprieties  insider trading and fraud at other public companies have created investor uncertainty and scrutiny in general as to the stability and veracity of public companies financial statements 
such lingering doubts stemming from the company s past accounting restatements and such general market uncertainty could harm our business and cause the price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate and or decline further 
our failure to carefully manage expenses and growth could cause our operating results to suffer 
in the past  our management of operational expenses  including the restructuring of our operations  and the growth of our business have placed a significant strain on managerial  operational and financial resources and contributed to our history of losses 
in addition  to manage any future growth and profitability  we may need to improve or replace our existing operational  customer service and financial systems  procedures and controls 
any failure to properly manage these systems and procedural transitions could impair our ability to attract and service customers  and could cause us to incur higher operating costs and delays in the execution of our business plan 
if we cannot manage growth and expenses effectively  our business and operating results could suffer 
we may not be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq national market and if we fail to do so  the price and liquidity of our common stock may decline 
the nasdaq stock market has quantitative maintenance criteria for the continued listing of common stock on the nasdaq national market 
the current requirements affecting us include i having net tangible assets of at least million and ii maintaining a minimum closing bid price per share of as of november  we were not in compliance with nasdaq national market minimum bid listing requirements and had not been in compliance since september  as of december   if our common stock price remains below and we were unable to take actions that resulted in per share closing bid price exceeding and remaining above for a period of ten trading days  and became subject to a delisting action of our common stock by the nasdaq national market 
upon receipt of the delisting notice we requested a hearing before the nasdaq listing qualifications panel  which was granted and held on january  at the hearing  the company presented its plan to regain long term compliance with the minimum closing bid listing requirement through effecting a reverse stock split of the company s common stock 
after the meeting  the nasdaq national market announced proposed rules changes that extended the grace period for regaining compliance with the minimum bid listing requirement and as result the company requested  and was granted  an extension on the delisting proceeding for a period of additional days pending review and approval by the sec of the rules change 
also effective november   we need to comply with the nasdaq national market s revised quantitative maintenance criteria including a new minimum requirement of million in stockholders equity 
the nasdaq national market s audit committee rules require that our audit committee be comprised of at least three independent members 
although we believe that we currently comply with this requirement and other nasdaq national marketplace rules  recent amendments to such rules may involve changes to listing requirements and the membership of our board committees  and will require review and potential changes in our policies  procedures and committee memberships to remain in compliance 
as a result  the company is currently evaluating its compliance with rule changes to ensure future compliance with proposed  and amended rules 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the quantitative or quantitative maintenance criteria or any of the nasdaq national market s listing requirements or other rules  or other markets listing requirements to the extent our stock is listed elsewhere  in the future 
if we fail to maintain continued listing on the nasdaq national market and must move to a market with less liquidity  our financial condition could be harmed and our stock price would likely further decline 
if we are delisted  it 
table of contents could have a material adverse effect on the market price of  and the liquidity of the trading market for  our common stock 
our stock price has demonstrated volatility and overall declines during recent quarters and continued volatility in the stock market may cause further fluctuations and or decline in our stock price 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to experience volatility  wide fluctuations and declines 
for example  during the fourth quarter of  the closing sale prices of our common stock on the nasdaq national market ranged from on october  to on december  the closing price of our stock on december  was per share  and on march  it was per share 
our stock price may further decline or fluctuate in response to any number of factors and events  such as announcements related to technological innovations  intense regulatory scrutiny and new corporate and securities and other legislation  strategic and sales relationships  new product and service offerings by us or our competitors  litigation outcomes  changes in senior management  changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  news reports relating to trends in our markets and the market for our stock  media interest in accounting scandals and corporate governance questions  overall market conditions and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
in addition  the stock market in general  particularly with respect to technology stocks  has experienced extreme volatility and a significant cumulative decline in recent quarters 
this volatility and decline has affected many companies  including our company  irrespective of the specific operating performance of such companies 
these broad market influences and fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  and our ability to remain listed on the nasdaq national market  regardless of our operating performance or other factors 
limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may harm our business 
our liability insurance for actions taken by officers and directors during the period from march to march  the period during which events related to securities class action lawsuits against us and certain of former executive officers are alleged to have occurred  provided only limited liability protection 
while these policies covered the settlement amount paid in connection with the settlement of the primary securities class action  there can be no assurance that the policies will continue to cover other pending matters and related expenses from that period or future periods 
if these policies do not adequately cover our expenses related to those lawsuits and the investigation  our business and financial condition could be seriously harmed 
our current director and officer liability insurance  which was put in place in march  and continues through march  contains similar provisions  and in the event circumstances arise requiring coverage by such policies there can be no assurance that they will be adequate for the liabilities and expenses potentially incurred 
to the extent liabilities  expenses  or settlements thereof  exceed the limitations of coverage  our business and financial condition could be materially harmed 
we are currently finalizing the terms and conditions of director and officer liability insurance for the period from march to march under california law  in connection with our charter documents and indemnification agreements we entered into with our executive officers and directors  we must indemnify our current and former officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law 
the indemnification covers any expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with the investigation  defense  settlement or appeal of legal proceedings 
the company has made payments in connection with the indemnification of officers and directors in connection with currently pending lawsuits and has reserved for estimated future amounts to be paid in connection with legal expenses and others costs of defense of pending lawsuits 
we may experience difficulty in attracting and retaining key personnel  which may negatively affect our ability to develop new services or retain and attract customers 
the loss of the services of key personnel could harm our business results 
our success also depends on our ability to recruit  retain and motivate highly skilled sales and marketing  operational  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for these people is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit  train or retain qualified personnel 
if we fail to do so  we may be unable to develop new services or continue to provide 
table of contents a high level of customer service  which could result in the loss of customers and revenues 
in addition  volatility and declines in our stock price may also affect our ability to retain key personnel  all of who have been granted stock based incentive compensation 
in recent quarters we have also initiated reductions in our work force and job eliminations to balance the size of our employee base with anticipated revenue levels 
reductions in our workforce could make it difficult to motivate and retain remaining employees or attract needed new employees  and provide distractions affecting our ability to deliver products and solutions in a timely fashion and provide a high level of customer service and support 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on our employees and have no plans to do so 
the loss of the services of one or more of our current key personnel could harm our business and affect our ability to successfully implement our business objectives 
if we are not successful in implementing strategic plans for our operations  our business could be negatively impacted 
during  we reorganized our product and service offerings around a group of core products deemed most imperative to our ability to serve the messaging and directory infrastructure market 
implementation of the plan occurred in the latter half of and  accordingly  products and services determined to be non core to our strategy were exited 
as a result  revenue from non core products and services comprising approximately of total revenues in the first quarter of declined to approximately of total revenues in the fourth quarter of and to none in our strategic plan also included initiatives aimed at reducing operating costs through headcount reduction and consolidation of approximately two thirds of our office space and related contracts and leases  all in keeping with our increased focus on core messaging products and services 
during the fourth quarter of we incurred additional charges in connection with previously announced reductions in force and were able to finalize the consolidation of additional facilities and related contracts and expenses associated with those facilities 
in  we have incurred a number of restructuring charges related to the right sizing of our business given market conditions and the current operating environment 
these efforts included additional facilities and equipment lease terminations  continuing expense management and headcount reductions 
we expect to continue to make determinations about the strategic future of our business and operations  and our ability to execute on such plans effectively and to make such determinations prudently could affect our future operations 
a failure to successfully execute on such plans and to plan appropriately could negatively affect our business and financial condition 
we may experience a decrease in market demand due to the slowing economy in the united states  which has been further stymied by the concerns of terrorism  war and social and political instability 
economic growth has slowed significantly  and some analysts believe the united states economy is experiencing a recession 
in addition  the terrorists attacks in the united states and turmoil in the middle east have increased the uncertainty in the united states economy and may further add to the decline in the united states business environment 
the war on terrorism  along with the effects of the terrorist attack and other similar events  or war in general  could contribute further to the slowdown of the already slumping market demand for goods and services  including digital communications software and services 
if the economy continues to decline as a result of the recent economic  political and social turmoil  or if there are further terrorist attacks in the united states or elsewhere  or because of the war in the middle east and elsewhere  we may experience decreases in the demand for our products and services  which may harm our operating results 
we may face continued technical  operational and strategic challenges preventing us from successfully integrating or divesting acquired businesses 
acquisitions involve risks related to the integration and management of acquired technology  operations and personnel 
in addition  in connection with our strategic restructuring  the company elected to divest or discontinue many of the acquired businesses 
both the integration and divestiture of acquired businesses have been and will continue to be complex  time consuming and expensive processes  which may disrupt and distract our management 
with respect to integration  we must operate as a combined organization utilizing 
table of contents common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices to be successful 
with respect to the divestitures  the timing and transition of those businesses and their customers to other entities has required and will continue to require resources from our legal  finance and corporate development teams as well as expenses associated with the conclusion of those transactions  winding up of entities and businesses 
in addition to the added costs of the divestitures  we may not ultimately achieve anticipated benefits and or cost reductions from such divestitures 
in the past  due to the significant underperformance of some of our acquisitions relative to expectations  we eliminated certain acquired product or service offerings through termination  sale or other disposition 
such decisions to eliminate or limit our offering of an acquired product or service involved and could continue to include the expenditure of capital  the realization of losses  further reduction in workforce  facility consolidation  and or the elimination of revenues along with the associated costs  any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we currently license many third party technologies and may need to license further technologies and we face risks in doing so that could cause our operating results to suffer 
we intend to continue to license certain technologies from third parties and incorporate such technologies into our products and services  including web server technology  virus and anti spam solutions  storage and encryption technology 
the market is evolving and we may need to license additional technologies to remain competitive 
we may not be able to license these technologies on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
to the extent we cannot license needed technologies or solutions  we may have to devote company resources to the development of such technologies that could materially harm our business and operations 
in addition  we may fail to successfully integrate any licensed technology into our services 
these third party in licenses may expose us to increased risks  including risks related to the integration of new technology  potential patent and copyright infringement issues  the diversion of resources from the development of proprietary technology  and an inability to generate revenues from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs 
in addition  an inability to obtain needed licenses could delay product and service development until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed and integrated 
any delays in services or integration problems could cause our business and operating results to suffer 
changes in the regulatory environment for the operation of our business or those of our customers could pose risks 
few laws currently apply directly to activity on the internet and the messaging business  however new laws are proposed and other laws made applicable to internet communications every year 
in particular  the operations of the company s business faces risks associated with privacy  confidentiality of user data and communications  consumer protection  taxation  content  copyright  trade secrets  trademarks  antitrust  defamation and other legal issues 
in particular  legal concerns with respect to communication of confidential data have affected our financial services and health care customers due to newly enacted federal legislation 
the growth of the industry and the proliferation of internet based messaging devices and services may prompt further legislative attention to our industry and thus invite more regulatory control of our business 
the imposition of more stringent protections and or new regulations and application of laws to our business could burden our company and those with which we do business 
further  the adoption of additional laws and regulations could limit the growth of our business and that of our business partners and customers 
any decreased generalized demand for our services or the loss of  or decrease  in business by a key partner due to regulation or the expense of compliance with any regulation  could either increase the costs associated with our business or affect revenue  either of which could harm our financial condition or operating results 
certain of our service offerings include operations subject to the digital millenium copyright act of the company has expended resources and implemented processes and controls in order to remain in compliance with dmca  but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be sufficient or that new legislation and case law will not affect the operation of certain services 

table of contents in addition  the applicability of laws and regulations directly applicable to the businesses of our customers  particularly customers in the fields of banking and health care  will continue to affect us 
the security of information about our customers end users continues to be an area where a variety of laws and regulations with respect to privacy and confidentiality are enacted 
as our customers implement the protections and prohibitions with respect to the transmission of end user data  our customers will look to us to assist them in remaining in compliance with this evolving area of regulation 
in particular the gramm leach blilely act contains restrictions with respect to the use and protection of banking records for end users whose information may pass through our system and the health insurance portability and accountability act contains provisions that require our customers to ensure the confidentiality of their customers health care information 
finally  the company faces increased regulatory scrutiny and potential criminal liability for its executives associated with various accounting and corporate governance rules promulgated under the sarbanes oxley act of the company is currently reviewing all of its accounting policies and practices  legal disclosure and corporate governance policies under the new legislation  including those related to its relationships with its independent accountants  enhanced financial disclosures  internal controls  board and board committee practices  corporate responsibility and loan practices  and intends to fully comply with such laws 
nevertheless  such increased scrutiny and penalties involve risks to both the company and its executive officers and directors in monitoring and insuring compliance 
a failure to properly navigate the legal disclosure environment and implement appropriate policies and procedures  if needed could harm the company s business and prospects 
we may have liability for internet content and we may not have adequate liability insurance 
as a provider of messaging and directory services  we face potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials transmitted via our services 
we do not and cannot screen all of the content generated by our users  and we could be exposed to liability with respect to this content 
furthermore  some foreign governments  such as germany  have enforced laws and regulations related to content distributed over the internet that are more strict than those currently in place in the united states 
in some instances  we may be subject to criminal liability in connection with internet content transmission 
although we carry general liability and umbrella liability insurance  our insurance may not cover claims of these types or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
there is a risk that a single claim or multiple claims  if successfully asserted against us  could exceed the total of our coverage limits 
there also is a risk that a single claim or multiple claims asserted against us may not qualify for coverage under our insurance policies as a result of coverage exclusions that are contained within these policies 
should either of these risks occur  capital contributed by our shareholders might need to be used to settle claims 
any imposition of liability  particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could harm our reputation and business and operating results  or could result in the imposition of criminal penalties 
unknown software defects could disrupt our services and harm our business and reputation 
our software products are inherently complex 
additionally  our product and service offerings depend on complex software  both internally developed and licensed from third parties 
complex software often contains defects or errors in translation  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released or localized for international markets 
we may not discover software defects in our products or that affect new or current services or enhancements until after they are deployed 
although we have not experienced any material software defects to date  it is possible that  despite testing  defects may occur in the software 
these defects could cause service interruptions  which could damage our reputation or increase service costs  cause us to lose revenue  delay market acceptance or divert development resources  any of which could cause our business to suffer 

table of contents unplanned system interruptions and capacity constraints could reduce our ability to provide messaging services and could harm our business reputation 
our customers have  in the past  experienced some interruptions in our messaging service 
we believe that these interruptions will continue to occur from time to time 
these interruptions are due to hardware failures  unsolicited bulk email  or spam  attacks and operating system failures 
our business will suffer if we experience frequent or long system interruptions that result in the unavailability or reduced performance of systems or networks or reduce our ability to provide email services 
we expect to experience occasional temporary capacity constraints due to sharply increased traffic  which may cause unanticipated system disruptions  slower response times  impaired quality and degradation in levels of customer service 
if this were to continue to happen  our business and reputation could suffer dramatically 
we have entered into messaging agreements with some customers that require minimum performance standards  including standards regarding the availability and response time of messaging services 
if we fail to meet these standards  our customers could terminate their relationships with us and we could be subject to contractual monetary penalties 
if our system security is breached  our business and reputation could suffer 
a fundamental requirement for online communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
third parties may attempt to breach our security or that of our customers 
if these attempts are successful  customers confidential information  including customers profiles  passwords  financial account information  credit card numbers or other personal information could be breached 
we may be liable to our customers for any breach in security and a breach could harm our reputation 
we rely on encryption technology licensed from third parties 
although we have implemented network security measures  our servers remain vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to license encryption technology and additional technologies to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breach 
failure to prevent security breaches may harm our business and operating results 
we rely on trademark  copyright  trade secret laws  contractual restrictions and patents to protect our proprietary rights  and if these rights are not sufficiently protected  our ability to compete and generate revenue could be harmed 
we rely on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  contractual restrictions  such as confidentiality agreements and licenses  and patents to establish and protect our proprietary rights  which we view as critical to our success 
our ability to compete and grow our business could suffer if these rights are not adequately protected 
despite the precautionary measures we take  unauthorized third parties may infringe or copy portions of our services or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary  which could harm our competitive position and market share 
in addition  we have several patents pending in the united states and may seek additional patents in the future 
however  the status of united states patent protection in the software industry is not well defined and will evolve as the us patent and trademark office grants additional patents 
we do not know if our patent applications or any of our future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought  if at all  or whether any patents we have received or will receive will be challenged or invalidated 
our proprietary rights may not be adequately protected because laws and contractual restrictions may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies  policing unauthorized use of our products and trademarks is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and we may be unable to determine the extent of this unauthorized use  and end user license provisions in our contracts that protect us against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of the licensed program may be unenforceable 

table of contents in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and competitors may independently develop similar technology 
additionally  although no claims of alleged patent infringement are currently pending  we cannot be certain that our products do not infringe issued patents that may relate to our products 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications may have been filed which relate to our software products 
our reserves may be insufficient to cover bills we are unable to collect 
we assume a certain level of credit risk with our customers in order to do business 
conditions affecting any of our customers could cause them to become unable or unwilling to pay us in a timely manner  or at all  for products or services we have already provided them 
for example  if the current economic conditions continue to decline or if new or unanticipated government regulations are enacted which affect our customers  they may be unable to pay their bills 
in the past  we have experienced significant collection delays from certain customers  and we cannot predict whether we will continue to experience similar or more severe delays in the future 
in particular  some of our customers are suffering from the general weakness in the economy and among technology companies in particular 
although we have established reserves to cover losses due to delays in or inability to pay  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be sufficient to cover our losses 
if losses due to delays or inability to pay are greater than our reserves  it could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we do not successfully address the risks inherent in the conduct of our international operations  our business could suffer 
we derived of our revenues from international sales in and of our revenues from international sales in we intend to continue to operate in international markets and to spend significant financial and managerial resources to do so 
in particular  we have purchased the remaining interests of our joint venture partners for our operations in japan 
we plan to expend revenues and resources to grow our operations in the asian market 
if revenues from international operations do not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining these operations  our business  financial condition and operating results will suffer 
we have limited experience in international operations and may not be able to compete or operate effectively in international markets 
we face certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  including difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and imposition of currency exchange controls  differing technology standards and language and translation issues  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  changes in regulatory requirements  including us export restrictions on encryption technologies  political and economic instability  potential adverse tax consequences  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
any of these factors could harm our international operations and  consequently  our business and consolidated operating results 
specifically  failure to successfully manage international growth could result in higher operating costs than anticipated or could delay or preclude altogether our ability to generate revenues in key international markets 

table of contents we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and any significance disruption in  or increase in the cost of  california s energy supply could harm our operations and increase our expenses 
during and  california experienced a serious energy crisis that could have and may in the future disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  california has on several occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout the state 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply or the power supply of any of our customers  we  or our customers  may be temporarily unable to operate 
any interruption in our ability to continue operations or significant increase in the cost of doing business could delay the development of or interfere with the sales of our products 
future interruptions could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
any interruption in the ability of our customers to continue their operations  could harm their business  and ultimately could also harm our business if they were to terminate or fail to renew contracts 
we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of blackouts  and any losses or damages we incur could harm our business 
furthermore  the deregulation of the energy industry instituted in by the california government and shortages in wholesale electricity supplies have caused power prices to increase dramatically 
if wholesale prices continue to increase  our operating expenses will likely increase  as our headquarters and many employees are based in california 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
some of these provisions authorize the issuance of preferred stock that can be created and issued by our board of directors without prior shareholder approval  commonly referred to as blank check preferred stock  with rights senior to those of our common stock  prohibit shareholder action by written consent  and establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at a meeting 
in march  we adopted a shareholder rights plan or poison pill 
this plan could cause the acquisition of our company by a party not approved by our board of directors to be prohibitively expensive

our long term obligations consist of our million five year  convertible subordinated notes due april  and certain fixed rate capital leases 
accordingly  an immediate change in interest rates would not affect our long term obligations or our results of operations 
a significant portion of our international operations has a functional currency other than the united states dollar 
accordingly  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales 
table of contents commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities of these operations 
fluctuations in exchange rates may harm our results of operations and could also result in exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations cannot be predicted with any certainty  however our exposure to foreign currency rate risk is primarily associated with fluctuations in the euro  italian lire and irish punt 
we realized a net loss on foreign exchange equal to  during  a net gain of  in and a net loss of  in to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates 
information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk is set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
