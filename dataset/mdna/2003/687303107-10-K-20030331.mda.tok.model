item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general since its inception  the activities of the company have consisted primarily of obtaining the rights for developing and marketing proposed pharmaceutical products  managing the development of these products and preparing for and initiating the commercial introduction of seven products 
the company operates in a single business segment pharmaceutical products 
the company has experienced recurring losses from operations and has generated an accumulated deficit through december  of million 
in addition  the company expects to incur additional losses from operations in recent developments on july  the company announced that the us food and drug administration fda had approved xyrem r sodium oxybate oral solution to treat cataplexy  a sudden loss of muscle tone associated with narcolepsy 
xyrem is the first approved medication indicated for the treatment of cataplexy 
narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder affecting approximately  americans 
an estimated percent of narcolepsy patients experience cataplexy 
cataplexy  a sudden partial or total loss of muscle tone  is a debilitating symptom of narcolepsy usually triggered by strong emotions such as laughter  anger  or surprise 
in its most severe form  cataplexy can cause a person to collapse during waking hours 
xyrem sodium oxybate is a central nervous system cns depressant and should not be used in conjunction with alcohol or other cns depressants 
sodium oxybate is ghb gamma hydroxybutyrate  a known drug of abuse 
the abuse of ghb has been associated with a number of important cns adverse clinical events  including seizure  respiratory depression  and profound decreases in level of consciousness  with instances of coma and death 
even at recommended doses  use has been associated with confusion and other neuropsychiatric events 
reports of respiratory difficulties occurred in clinical trials 
distribution of xyrem  a schedule iii controlled substance  is governed by the fda s subpart h regulations 
to comply with these regulations  the company has developed a rigorous system that makes xyrem available to patients from a single  specialty pharmacy 
both physicians and patients must receive educational materials from the company before obtaining xyrem 
orphan medical has worked closely with the fda  dea and law enforcement agencies to develop strict distribution and risk management controls designed to restrict access to xyrem to the intended patient population 
the company has hired and trained additional sales employees who will call on accredited sleep centers  and other physician specialists treating those with cataplexy 
the company launched xyrem on october  the company has worked with physicians  patients  and fda for nearly eight years to bring xyrem to patients with cataplexy 
the company is continuing investigations to fully understand the mechanism of action of xyrem 
the company also expects to complete by the end of the clinical portion of the phase iii b trial designed to assess the efficacy of xyrem in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness as a supplement to stimulant therapy 
the company has initiated a second phase iii b trial to assess the efficacy of xyrem in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness both with and without concomitant stimulant therapy 
on march   the company cancelled its existing line of credit facility and entered into a new facility with a commercial bank 
the new line of credit facility  which has a term of one year  includes a borrowing base equal to of eligible accounts receivable up to a maximum amount of million 
certain other assets have also been pledged as collateral for this facility 
the interest rate is equal to two points over the bank s prime rate 
the company will be subject to certain other requirements during the term of the facility  including minimum quarterly net equity amounts 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition sales for all products except xyrem r sodium oxybate oral solution are recognized at the time a product is shipped to the company s customers and are recorded net of reserves for estimated returns of outdated product and for discounts for prompt payment 
sales of xyrem are recognized at the time product is shipped from the specialty pharmacy to the patient and are recorded net of discounts for prompt payment 
except for xyrem  the company is obligated to accept  for exchange  from all domestic customers products that have reached their expiration date 
the company is not obligated to accept exchange of outdated product from its international distribution partners 
the company establishes a reserve for the estimated cost of the exchanges 
the company monitors the return of product and modifies its accrual for outdated product returns as necessary 
management bases these reserves on historical experience and this estimate is subject to change 
accounts receivable allowance the company determines an allowance amount based upon an analysis of the collectibility of specific accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
there is a concentration of sales to larger medical wholesalers and distributors 
the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition 
domestic receivables are due within days of the invoice date 
international receivables are generally due within to days of invoice date 
credit losses relating to customers have not been material since the company s inception 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company s policy is to establish an excess and obsolete reserve for its products in excess of the expected demand for such products 
results of operations twelve months ended december  vs 
twelve months ended december  revenues increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
sales of both antizol and busulfex exceeded revenue expectations in antizol r fomepizole injection performed very well throughout sales of the antidote experienced growth as compared to the prior year and antizol is being stocked in over one third of all hospitals with emergency departments 
antizol is established as the standard of care for confirmed or suspected ethylene glycol and methanol poisonings 
use of busulfex r busulfan injection in preparative regimens for bone marrow transplantation also continues to realize significant growth in the united states  canada and other countries 
busulfex continues to advance into new research areas in place of oral busulfan or total body irradiation  and now holds an approximate percent market share of the transplants that include a busulfan based regimen 
the sales of cystadane  sucraid antizol vet and elliotts b met the company s expectations in and are not expected to increase significantly in revenues will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year depending on  among other factors  demand for the company s products  new product introductions and the company s ability to optimize distribution of its approved products 
cost of sales increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in sales in the gross margins for both and were 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year depending on  among other factors  demand for the company s products  new product introductions and the mix of approved products shipped 
research and development expense increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase is the result of increased activity in ongoing trials for xyrem and other development activities related to xyrem and other products 
the two phase iii b trials for xyrem  now underway  will increase research and development spending in subsequent quarters  as will additional trials and data updates requested by the fda 
clinical spending for these activities will be dependent on a number of factors  including among others  the number of human subjects screened and enrolled in the trials  and the number of active clinical sites 
sales and marketing expense increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase is largely attributable to activities for xyrem  including the development of marketing materials  the recruitment and training of a dedicated specialty sales force  the implementation of the specialty distribution system and the ongoing activities associated with initial introduction of a new product 
sales and marketing expenses will increase versus historical levels in subsequent quarters to support the sales and marketing efforts related to xyrem 
general and administrative expense increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is related to building infrastructure for the launch and subsequent support of xyrem 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase somewhat above current levels in the next few quarters as additional personnel are added and other support projects are initiated 
other income consists of interest income from investment activities net of interest expense 
other income was million for the twelve months ended december  and even though the equity transaction completed in december increased the cash available for investment in  the lower interest rates and the cash used to fund development and working capital activities of the company resulted in no increase in interest income for over other income is expected to decrease in as a result of cash used to fund development and working capital activities of the company 
preferred stock dividends relate to the senior convertible preferred stock that was issued on july  and series b convertible preferred stock issued on august  both have dividend rates of 
preferred stock dividends were million for the twelve months ended december  and preferred stock dividends  which commenced on february   are payable in arrears on august and february of each year 
prior to february  the company satisfied its dividend payment obligation by issuing additional preferred stock  as permitted by the terms of the senior convertible stock 
subsequent to february  the company intends to continue to satisfy its future dividend payment obligations by the issuance of unregistered common shares of stock for the senior convertible preferred stock and additional preferred stock for the series b convertible preferred stock  which will cause preferred stock dividends to increase in subsequent quarters 
net loss applicable to common shareholders was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the twelve months ended december  basic and diluted loss per common share for these respective periods were and  based on weighted average number of common shares outstanding of  and  respectively 
twelve months ended december  vs 
twelve months ended december  revenues increased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
sales of both antizol and busulfex exceeded revenue expectations in international sales of the company s products decreased in due primarily to a delay in the shipment of clinical trial supply product requested by an international partner 
the sales of cystadane  sucraid antizol vet and elliotts b met the company s expectations in and are not expected to increase significantly in cost of sales increased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in sales in the gross margins for both and were 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year depending on  among other factors  demand for the company s products  new product introductions and the mix of approved products shipped 
research and development expense decreased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease was the result of reduced research and development spending on xyrem during the company s efforts in were primarily focused on supporting the xyrem nda submission 
the spending includes ongoing trials for xyrem and other development and regulatory activities 
prior year spending included amounts for clinical trials included in the nda submission 
sales and marketing expense increased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase was largely attributable to significantly higher spending related to the pre approval market activities related to xyrem 
general and administrative expense increased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
approximately of the increase in general and administrative expenses is related to compensation expense associated with stock options 
the balance of the increase is related to building infrastructure  including the addition of staff to prepare for the anticipated launch of xyrem 
other income consists of interest income from investment activities net of interest expense 
other income decreased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is the result of cash used to fund development and working capital activities of the company 
in addition  interest rates on invested funds declined  reducing the yields received 
preferred stock dividends relate to the senior convertible preferred stock that was issued on july  and series b convertible preferred stock issued on august  both have dividend rates of 
preferred stock dividends were million for the twelve months ended december  and preferred stock dividends  which commenced on february   are payable in arrears on august and february of each year 
the company previously satisfied its dividend payment obligation by issuing additional preferred stock  as permitted by the terms of the senior convertible stock 
the company intends to continue to satisfy its future dividend payment obligations by the issuance of unregistered common shares of stock for the senior convertible preferred stock and additional preferred stock for the series b convertible preferred stock  which will cause preferred stock dividends to increase in subsequent quarters 
net loss applicable to common shareholders was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the twelve months ended december  basic and diluted loss per common share for these respective periods were and  based on weighted average number of common shares outstanding of  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources since july   the effective date the company was spun off from chronimed inc  it has financed its operations principally from net proceeds from several public and private financings  interest income and product sales 
the various public and private placement transactions since inception resulted in aggregate net proceeds  after commissions and expenses  of million 
these net proceeds include the private placement of million shares of newly issued common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million in december net working capital current assets less current liabilities decreased to million at december  from million at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december  from million at december  the company invests excess cash in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
the company has a commercial revolving line of credit facility with a bank  which expires on june  the maximum amount available to the company under this facility is  subject to certain limitations based on the company s cash collateral 
the company intends to renew this line of credit facility 
however the company cannot assure that the bank will do so  or that it would do so on terms acceptable to the company 
in connection with the financing transaction in august  the company received a million commitment in the form of a line of credit from ubs capital 
this line was eliminated as a provision of the financing transaction in december the company had not borrowed under the ubs capital agreement 
in addition  the company had not borrowed under the bank arrangement 
as discussed previously  the company entered into a new line of credit facility with a commercial bank on march  the new line of credit facility  which has a term of one year  includes a borrowing base equal to of eligible accounts receivable up to a maximum amount of million 
certain other assets have also been pledged as collateral for this facility 
the interest rate is equal to two points over the bank s prime rate 
the company will be subject to certain other requirements during the term of the facility  including minimum quarterly net equity amounts 
the company s commitments for outside development spending increased to approximately million at december  from million at december  these commitments are generally for less than one year 
the increase is principally attributable to the timing of the initiation of clinical trials for xyrem development activities 
the company expects development spending to increase as the two xyrem phase iii b clinical trials progress and post approval surveillance studies are completed 
in addition  the company continues to look at new product opportunities and any new initiatives will increase development spending 
due to the dependence of this estimate on the results of the studies and other variable components  the actual result of this estimate may be different 
the company also has future contractual commitments for the following cash obligations total less than one year years years after years capital lease obligations     operating lease obligations    outside development spending   total contractual cash obligations     these amounts include both space for facilities and automobiles for the company s field sales force 
the company expects spending during for research and development  sales and marketing  and administration to increase significantly over levels 
management believes the company s current working capital and anticipated operating cash flows from product sales will be sufficient to fund its operations at least through december  for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  a company must satisfy a number of requirements  which in the company s case include either minimum net equity in excess of million or a market capitalization of at least million 
the company met the market capitalization threshold at december  the company s minimum net equity at december  equaled approximately million and the company s market capitalization was approximately million based on the last sale price of and  shares outstanding as of december  
although the company does not expect to be profitable in  the company nevertheless expects to continue to meet the requirements for listing on the nasdaq national market 
however there can be no assurance that the company will continue to have adequate capital to meet the requirements through the year and thereafter 
in connection with the and private placements of convertible preferred stock  the company agreed to certain restrictions and covenants  which could limit its ability to obtain additional financing 
the most important of the restrictions are the company cannot incur additional indebtedness  except for indebtedness secured solely by the company s trade receivables  until it has profitable operations  subject to certain limitations and the company cannot  without the approval of a majority of the preferred stockholders  issue additional equity securities unless the selling price per share exceeds the then conversion price of the outstanding convertible preferred stock or the sale of equity is accomplished in a public offering 
the present conversion price is for the senior convertible preferred stock and for the series b convertible preferred stock 
even without these restrictions  the company can make no assurances that additional financing opportunities will be available or  if available  on acceptable terms 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a number of risks  including among others  risks associated with companies that operate in the pharmaceutical industry 
these risks are substantial and inherent in our operations and industry 
any investor or potential investor should carefully consider the following information about these risks before buying shares of common stock 
we have a history of losses  which we expect to continue 
we have been unprofitable since our inception in january we expect operating losses at least through because anticipated gross profits from product revenues will not offset our operating expenses and additional spending to continue drug development activities 
the amount of these losses may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter 
our actual losses will depend on  among other factors  the timing of product development  regulatory approval  and market demand for our food and drug administration fda approved products 
we cannot assure you that we will ever generate sufficient product revenues to achieve profitability 
limitations to sources of additional capital restrictions  covenants and rights related to senior convertible preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock 
on july   we completed the private sale to ubs capital of million of senior convertible preferred stock 
on august   we completed another private sale to ubs capital of million of series b convertible preferred stock 
in conjunction with the issuance of the preferred shares  we agreed to several restrictions and covenants  and granted certain voting and other rights to the holders of the preferred shares 
one of the most important of these restrictions is that we cannot incur additional indebtedness  except for indebtedness secured solely by our trade receivables  until we have profitable operations  subject to certain limitations 
another important restriction is that  without the approval of a majority of the preferred stockholders  we cannot issue additional equity securities unless the selling price per share exceeds the then conversion price of the outstanding convertible preferred stock or the sale of equity is accomplished in a public offering 
the present conversion price is per share for the senior convertible preferred stock and for the series b convertible preferred stock 
these restrictions could make it more difficult and more costly for us to obtain additional capital 
we cannot assure you that additional sources of capital will be available to us or  if available  on terms acceptable to us 
possible price volatility and limited liquidity of stock 
there is generally significant volatility in the market prices and limited liquidity of securities of early stage companies  and particularly of early stage pharmaceutical companies 
contributing to this volatility are various factors and events that can affect our stock price in a positive or negative manner 
these factors and events include  but are not limited to o announcements by us or our competitors of new product developments or clinical testing results  o governmental approvals  refusals to approve  regulations or actions  o developments or disputes relating to patents or proprietary rights  o public concern over the safety of therapies  o financial performance  o fluctuations in financial performance from period to period  and o small float or number of shares of our stock available for sale and trade 
these and other factors and events may have a significant impact on our business and on the market price of the common stock 
we cannot be sure that future capital will be available to meet our expected capital requirements 
although we believe that we have sufficient capital to meet out current business objectives  if we expand our business plans  we may need additional capital 
adequate funds for our operations  continued development  and expansion of our business plans  whether from financial markets or from other sources  may not be available when needed on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we issue additional securities your holding may be diluted 
possible volatility of stock price and reduced liquidity of the market for the stock possible loss of nasdaq national market listing and failure to qualify for nasdaq small cap market listing 
there is a risk that the market value and the liquidity of the public float for our common stock could be adversely affected in the event we no longer meet the nasdaq s requirements for continued listing on the national market 
for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  a company must satisfy a number of requirements  which in our case includes either minimum net equity in excess of million as reported on form q or form k or a market capitalization of at least million 
market capitalization is defined as total outstanding shares multiplied by the last sales price quoted by nasdaq 
we met the market capitalization criteria as of december   however  we cannot assure you that the market capitalization threshold will continue to be met or that we will be able to generate adequate capital to meet the net tangible asset requirement 
there is a limited market for our products 
most orphan drugs have a potential united states market of less than million annually and many address annual markets of less than million 
we cannot assure you that sales of our products will be adequate to make us profitable even if the products are accepted by medical specialists and used by patients 
we rely on the limited protection of the orphan drug act 
united states under the orphan drug act  the fda may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition 
the orphan drug act generally defines rare disease or condition as one that affects populations of fewer than  people in the united states 
the orphan drug act provides us with certain limited protections for our products 
the first step in obtaining the limited protection under the orphan drug act is acquiring the fda s approval of orphan drug designation  which must be requested before submitting a new drug application nda 
after the fda grants orphan drug designation  it publishes the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and the potential orphan use specified in the request 
orphan drug designation does not constitute fda approval 
in addition  orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the regulatory approval process 
the second step in obtaining the limited protection under the orphan drug act is acquiring the fda s recognition of orphan drug status 
the orphan drug act confers orphan drug status upon the first company to receive fda approval to market a drug with orphan drug designation for a specific designated indication 
orphan drug status does not protect against another formulation or drug of materially different composition from being approved  with or without orphan drug status  for the same indication 
fda approval also results in united states marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years  subject to certain limitations 
although obtaining fda approval to market a product with orphan drug status can be advantageous  we cannot assure you that the scope of protection or the level of marketing exclusivity will remain in effect in the future 
in addition  united states orphan drug status does not provide any marketing exclusivity in foreign markets 
although certain foreign countries provide development and marketing benefits to orphan drugs  we cannot assure you that such benefits can be obtained or  if obtained  will be of material value to us 
the fda has granted us orphan drug status for xyrem  antizol  elliotts b solution  cystadane  sucraid  and busulfex 
even if the fda approves an nda for a drug with an orphan drug designation  the fda may still approve the same drug for a different indication  or a molecular variation of the same drug for the same indication 
we are aware that the fda granted to sparta pharmaceutical  which has been acquired by supergen inc  orphan drug designation for an intravenous busulfan for a closely related indication 
if the fda approves an nda for supergen drug for a different indication  supergen could seek orphan drug status 
in addition  the fda does not restrict doctors from prescribing an approved drug for uses not approved by the fda for that drug 
thus  a doctor could prescribe another company s drug for indications for which our product has received fda approval and orphan drug status 
significant off label use  that is  prescribing approved drugs for unapproved uses  could adversely affect the marketing potential of any of our products that have received orphan drug status and nda approval by fda 
the possible amendment of the orphan drug act by congress has been the subject of congressional discussion from time to time over the last ten years 
although congress has made no significant changes to the orphan drug act for a number of years  members of congress have from time to time proposed legislation that would limit the application of the orphan drug act 
we cannot assure you that the orphan drug act will remain in effect or that it will remain in effect in its current form 
the precise scope of protection that orphan drug designation and marketing approval may afford in the future is unknown 
we cannot assure you that the current level of exclusivity will remain in effect 
europe an orphan drug act was enacted in europe that provides up to ten years of market exclusivity for a drug that meets the requirements of the act 
for a pharmaceutical product to qualify for the benefits of the act  the prevalence or incidence whichever is greater must not exceed five patients per  in the population 
our european partners have obtained orphan drug designation for both busulfex and cystadane europe 
the company has obtained orphan drug designation for xyrem and antizol  for use in methanol poisonings  in europe 
we cannot provide assurance that any of our pharmaceutical products will qualify for orphan drug protection in europe or that another company will not obtain an approval that would block us from marketing our product in europe 
the fda and foreign regulatory authorities must approve our products for sale 
government regulation in the united states and abroad is a significant factor in the testing  production and marketing of our current and future products 
each product must undergo an extensive regulatory review process conducted by the united states food and drug administration and by comparable agencies in other countries 
we cannot market any medicine we may develop or license as a prescription product in any jurisdiction  including foreign countries  in which the product does not receive regulatory approval 
the approval process can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
we depend on external laboratories and medical institutions to conduct our pre clinical and clinical analytical testing in compliance with good clinical and laboratory practices established by the fda 
the data obtained from pre clinical and clinical testing is subject to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
in addition  changes in fda policy for drug approval during the period of development and in the requirements for regulatory review of each submitted nda could result in additional delays or outright rejection 
we cannot assure you that the fda or any foreign regulatory authority will approve in a timely manner  if at all  any product we develop 
generally  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities approve only a very small percentage of newly discovered pharmaceutical compounds that enter pre clinical development 
moreover  even if the fda approves a product  it may place commercially unacceptable limitations on the uses  or indications  for which a product may be marketed 
this would result in additional cost and delay for further studies to provide additional data on safety or effectiveness 
fda approval does not guarantee financial success 
seven of our products have been approved for marketing by regulatory authorities in the united states and elsewhere 
we cannot assure you that any of our products will be commercially successful or achieve the expected financial results 
we may encounter unanticipated problems relating to the development  manufacturing  distribution and marketing of our products 
some of these problems may be beyond our financial and technical capacity to solve 
the failure to adequately address any such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business and our prospects 
in addition  the efforts of government entities and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care may adversely affect our sales and limit the commercial success of our products 
we cannot completely insulate our drug development portfolio from the possibility of clinical or commercial failures 
some products that we have selected for development may not produce the results expected during clinical trials or receive fda approval 
drugs approved by the fda may not generate product sales of an acceptable level 
we have discontinued the development of eleven products from our portfolio since inception 
significant government regulation continues once a product is approved for sale 
after a reviewing division of the fda approves a drug  the fda s division of drug marketing  advertising and communication must accept such drug s marketing claims  which are the basis for the drug s labeling  advertising and promotion 
we cannot be sure that the division of drug marketing  advertising and communication will accept our proposed marketing claims 
the failure of the division of drug marketing  advertising and communication to accept our proposed marketing claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
the fda can require that a company conduct post marketing adverse event surveillance programs to monitor any side effects that occur after the company s drug is approved for marketing 
if the surveillance program indicates unsafe side effects  the fda may recall the product  and suspend or terminate a company s authorization to market the product 
the fda also regulates the manufacturing process for an approved drug 
the fda may impose restrictions or sanctions upon the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer 
one possible sanction is requiring the withdrawal of such product from the market 
the fda must approve any change in manufacturer as well as most changes in the manufacturing process prior to implementation 
obtaining the fda s approval for a change in manufacturing procedures or change in manufacturers is a lengthy process and could cause production delays and loss of sales  which would have a material adverse effect on our business and our prospects 
certain foreign countries regulate the sales price of a product after marketing approval is granted 
we cannot be sure that we can sell our products at satisfactory prices in foreign markets even if foreign regulatory authorities grant marketing approval 
we rely on others for product development opportunities 
we engage only in limited research to identify new pharmaceutical compounds 
to build our product portfolio  we have adopted a license and acquisition strategy 
this strategy for growth requires us to identify and acquire pharmaceutical products targeted at niche markets within selected strategic therapeutic market segments 
these products usually require further development and approval by regulatory bodies before they can be marketed 
we cannot assure you that any such products can be successfully acquired  developed  approved or marketed 
we must rely upon the willingness of others to sell or license pharmaceutical product opportunities to us 
other companies  including those with substantially greater resources  compete with us to acquire such products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire rights to additional products on acceptable terms  if at all 
our failure to acquire or license any new pharmaceutical products  or our failure to promote and market any products successfully or products within an existing therapeutic areas  could have a material adverse effect on our business and our prospects 
we have contractual development rights to certain compounds through various license agreements 
generally  the licensor can unilaterally terminate these agreements for several reasons  including  but not limited to the following reasons o for cause if we breach the contract  o if we become insolvent or bankrupt  o if we do not apply specified minimum resources and efforts to develop the compound under license  or o if we do not achieve certain minimum royalty payments  or in some cases  minimum sales levels 
we cannot assure you that we can meet all specified requirements and avoid termination of any license agreements 
we cannot assure you that if any agreement is terminated  we will be able to enter into similar agreements on terms as favorable as those contained in our existing license agreements 
we depend on others to manufacture and supply the products we market 
we do not have and do not intend to establish any internal product testing  synthesis of bulk drug substance  or manufacturing capability for drug product 
accordingly  we depend on others to supply and manufacture the components incorporated into all of our finished drug products 
the inability to contract for these purposes on acceptable terms could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products 
failure by parties with whom we contract to adequately perform their responsibilities may delay the submission of products for regulatory approval  impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis or otherwise adversely affect our business and our prospects 
the loss of a supply or manufacturing contractor could materially adversely affect our business and our prospects 
the loss of either a bulk drug supplier or drug product manufacturer would require us to obtain regulatory clearance in the form of a pre approval submission and incur validation and other costs associated with the transfer of the bulk drug or drug product manufacturing process 
we believe that it could take as long as two years for the fda to approve such a submission 
because our products are targeted to relatively small markets and our manufacturing production runs are small by industry standards  we have not incurred the added costs to certify and maintain secondary sources of supply for bulk drug substance or backup drug product manufacturers for some products 
should we lose either a bulk drug supplier or a drug product manufacturer  we could run out of salable product to meet market demands or investigational product for use in clinical trials  while we wait for the fda approval of a new bulk drug supplier or drug product manufacturer 
we cannot assure you that the change of a bulk drug supplier or drug product manufacturer and the transfer of the processes to another third party will be approved by the fda  and if approved  in a timely manner 
the loss of or the change of a bulk drug supplier or a drug product manufacturer could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
bulk drug supply bulk drug substance is the active chemical compound used in the manufacture of our drug products 
we depend substantially on a single supplier for the supply of bulk drug substance used in busulfex  antizol  and antizol vet 
if we were to lose this company as a supplier  we would be required to identify a new supplier for the bulk drug substance used in products that provided approximately of our total revenues in  and  and which are expected to account for approximately of our revenues in we depend substantially on a different supplier for the supply of bulk drug substance used in xyrem  which is expected to account for approximately of our revenue in if we were to lose this company as a supplier  we would be required to identify a new supplier 
we also cannot assure you that our bulk drug supply arrangements with our current suppliers  or any other future such supplier  might not change in the future 
we cannot assure you that any change would not adversely affect production of busulfex  antizol  antizol vet  xyrem  or any other drug the company might attempt to develop or market 
drug product manufacture from bulk drug substance  drug product manufacturers formulate a finished drug product and package the product for sale or for use in clinical trials 
we depend substantially on a single supplier for drug product manufacturing of busulfex  antizol  and antizol vet and a different supplier has been authorized to manufacture xyrem 
if we were to lose either of these companies as a manufacturer  we would be required to identify a new manufacturer for drug products that provided approximately of our total revenues in  and  and which are expected to account for approximately of our revenues in we depend substantially on a different supplier for the supply of xyrem  which is expected to account for approximately of our revenue in if we were to lose this company as a supplier  we would be required to identify a new manufacturer 
we cannot assure you that our drug product manufacturing arrangements with either or both of these suppliers will not change or that the manufacturing services will continue to be available on terms satisfactory to us 
any change in our manufacturing agreements could adversely affect production of busulfex  antizol  antizol vet or xyrem  or any other drug that we might attempt to develop or market  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we cannot control our contractors compliance with applicable regulations 
the fda defines and regulates good manufacturing practices to which bulk drug suppliers and drug product manufacturers are subject 
the drug enforcement agency dea defines and regulates the handling and reporting requirements for certain drugs which have abuse potential  known as scheduled drugs 
foreign regulatory authorities prescribe similar rules and regulations 
our supply and manufacturing contractors must comply with these regulatory requirements 
failure by our contractors to comply with fda or dea requirements or applicable foreign requirements could result in significant time delays or in our inability to commercialize or continue to market a product 
either result could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
failure to comply with good manufacturing practices or other applicable legal requirements can lead to federal seizure of violative products  injunctive actions brought by the federal government  or potential criminal and civil liability for orphan  our officers  or our employees 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain relationships either domestically or abroad with contractors whose facilities and procedures comply or will continue to comply with fda or dea requirements or applicable foreign requirements 
we depend upon others for distribution 
we have an agreement with a specialty pharmacy to distribute xyrem 
xyrem is classified as a schedule iii controlled substance and approved under subpart h of the fda s review process  and distribution will be strictly controlled 
the specialty pharmacy will be the only source through which xyrem can be obtained 
distribution will be governed by the fda s subpart h regulations and will fully comply with the risk management controls jointly developed by orphan medical  the fda  the drug enforcement agency and law enforcement agencies 
every shipment of xyrem will be subject to stringent safeguards to ensure it reaches only individuals for whom it has been legitimately prescribed 
we have an agreement with a distribution contractor to provide integrated distribution and operations services to support transactions between us and our wholesalers  specialty distributors  and direct customers 
this contractor also provides reimbursement management  patient assistance and information hotline services and specialty distribution and marketing services to physician practices with respect to our products 
the contractor currently distributes busulfex  elliotts b solution  antizol  antizol vet  and sucraid 
the contractor may also distribute future products should those products receive marketing clearance from the fda 
we are substantially dependent on this contractor s ability to successfully distribute busulfex  elliotts b solution  antizol  antizol vet  and sucraid and other potential products 
a mail order pharmacy is the principal distributor  on a non exclusive basis  in the united states for cystadane 
the pharmacy distributes this product directly to patients through the mail 
we are substantially dependent on this pharmacy s ability to successfully distribute cystadane directly to patients in the united states 
we cannot assure you that our distribution arrangements with these three entities or other companies would be available  or continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms 
the loss of a distributor or failure to renew agreements with an existing distributor would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we rely on foreign marketing alliances and have no assurance of foreign licensees 
our strategy to sell our products in foreign markets is to license foreign marketing and distribution rights to a foreign company after a new drug application referred to in the industry as an nda is submitted or approved in the united states 
we consider europe  asia  and canada our most attractive foreign markets 
our current foreign arrangements are o europe 
we have licensed the marketing and distribution rights for busulfex  antizol  cystadane and sucraid in europe 
if our licensees are unsuccessful in their registration and distribution efforts  we may find it difficult to contract with other distributors for these products within europe 
distribution of all products except antizol is limited to named patient or emergency use basis until full regulatory approval is obtained 
antizol has been approved for use in the united kingdom but is limited to named patient basis in other parts of europe 
this distribution of the company s products is expected to result in a limited contribution to the company s revenues 
o australia and new zealand 
we have licensed marketing and distribution rights for cystadane and sucraid in australia and new zealand  but sales of these products have not been material 
we do not expect sales to increase in the near future to the point that they become material 
o israel 
we have licensed marketing and distribution rights for antizol  busulfex  cystadane  elliotts b solution and sucraid in israel 
full regulatory approval for all products except antizol was obtained in israel in february we do not expect such distribution to result in material revenues 
o canada 
we have licensed marketing and distribution rights for antizol in canada 
for cystadane we have only licensed the distribution rights in canada 
we do not expect such distribution to result in material revenues 
o central america 
we have licensed marketing and distribution rights for elliotts b solution in central america  but sales have not been material 
we do not expect domestic or foreign sales of elliotts b solution to become material 
o asia 
we have licensed marketing and distribution rights for busulfex in japan  the peoples republic of china  taiwan and south korea 
distribution is limited to clinical trial usage until full regulatory approval is achieved 
we have also licensed marketing and distribution rights for busulfex in turkey 
we depend on our foreign licensees for the regulatory registration of our products in foreign countries 
we cannot be sure that our licensees can obtain such registration 
in addition  we cannot be sure that we will be able to negotiate commercially acceptable license agreements for our other products or in additional foreign countries 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that these companies will be successful in marketing and selling our products in their respective territories 
our products might be recalled 
a product can be recalled at our discretion or at the discretion of the fda  the us federal trade commission  or other government agencies having regulatory authority for marketed products 
a recall may occur due to disputed labeling claims  manufacturing issues  quality defects  safety issues  or other reasons 
we cannot assure you that a product recall will not occur 
we do not carry any insurance to cover the risk of a potential product recall 
any product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
to date  no recall of products marketed by the company has occurred 
we face limits on price flexibility and third party reimbursement 
the flexibility of prices that we can charge for our products depends on government regulation  both in the united states and abroad  and on other third parties 
one important factor is the extent to which reimbursement for our products will be available to patients from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other third party payors 
government officials and private health insurers are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services 
we are uncertain as to the pricing flexibility we will have with respect to  and if we will be reimbursed for  newly approved health care products 
in the united states  we expect continuing federal and state proposals to implement greater government control of the pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals 
cost controls  if mandated by a government agency  could decrease  or limit  the price we receive for our products or products we may develop in the future 
we may not be able to recover our development costs  which could be substantial 
we may not be able to realize an appropriate profit margin 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business 
furthermore  federal and state regulations govern or influence reimbursement of health care providers for medical treatment of certain patients 
we cannot assure you that actions taken by federal and or state governments  if any  with regard to health care reform will not have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
certain private health insurers and third party payors may attempt to control costs further by selecting exclusive providers of pharmaceuticals 
if such arrangements are made with our competitors  these insurers and third party payors would not reimburse patients who purchase our competing products 
this would diminish the market for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
patents and other proprietary rights are significant factors in the pharmaceutical industry 
the pharmaceutical industry and the investment community places considerable importance and value on obtaining patent  proprietary  and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
the patent position of pharmaceutical firms is often highly uncertain and generally involves complex legal  technical and factual questions 
our success depends on several issues  including  but not limited to our ability o to obtain  and enforce proprietary protection for our products under united states and foreign patent laws and other intellectual property laws  o to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets  and o to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
we evaluate the desirability of seeking patent or other forms of protection for our products in foreign markets based on the expected costs and relative benefits of attaining such protection 
we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued from any applications or that any issued patents will afford us adequate protection or competitive advantage 
also  we cannot assure you that any issued patents will not be challenged  invalidated  infringed or circumvented 
parties not affiliated with us have obtained or may obtain united states or foreign patents or possess or may possess proprietary rights relating to our products 
we cannot assure you that patents now in existence or later issued to others will not adversely affect the development or commercialization of our products 
we believe that the active ingredients or compounds in our fda approved products  cystadane  elliotts b solution  antizol  antizol vet  xyrem and sucraid  are in the public domain and presently are not subject to patent protection in the united states 
however  we have a patent with respect to our formulation of xyrem oral solution 
united states patents issued to the licensor covers our formulation and use of busulfex 
we could  however  incur substantial costs asserting any infringement claims that we may have against others 
we seek to protect our proprietary information and technology  in part  through confidentiality agreements and inventors rights agreements with our employees 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise be disclosed to or discovered by our competitors 
we also cannot assure you that our planned activities will not infringe patents owned by others 
we could incur substantial costs in defending infringement suits brought against us 
we also could incur substantial costs in connection with any suits relating to matters for which we have agreed to indemnify our licensors or distributors 
an adverse outcome in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
in addition  we often must obtain licenses under patents or other proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot assure you that we can obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we cannot obtain required licenses on acceptable terms  we could encounter substantial difficulties in developing  manufacturing or marketing one or more of our products 
we face intense competition in our industry 
competition in the pharmaceutical industry is intense 
potential competitors in the united states are numerous and include pharmaceutical  chemical and biotechnology companies 
many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources  marketing experience  research and development staffs and facilities than we do 
we seek to limit potential sources of competition by developing products that are eligible for orphan drug status upon nda approval or other forms of protection 
we cannot assure you  however  that our competitors will not succeed in developing similar technologies and products more rapidly than we can 
similarly  we cannot assure you that these competing technologies and products will not be more effective than any of those that we have developed or are currently developing 
we expect rapid technological and other change to be constant in our industry 
the pharmaceutical industry has experienced rapid and significant technological change as well as structural changes  such as those brought about by changes in heath care delivery or in product distribution 
we expect that pharmaceutical technology will continue to develop and change rapidly  and our future success will depend  in large part  on our ability to develop and maintain a competitive position 
technological development by others may result in our products becoming obsolete before they are marketed or before we recover a significant portion of the development and commercialization expenses incurred with respect to such products 
in addition  alternative therapies  new medical treatments  or changes in the manner in which health care is delivered or products provided could alter existing treatment regimes or health care practices  and thereby reduce the need for one or more of our products  which would adversely affect our business and our prospects 
we face substantial product liability and insurance risks 
testing and selling health care products entails the inherent risk of product liability claims 
the cost of product liability insurance coverage has increased and is likely to continue to increase in the future 
substantial increases in insurance premium costs in many cases have rendered coverage economically impractical 
we currently carry product liability coverage in the aggregate amount of million for all claims made in any policy year 
although to date we have not been the subject of any product liability or other claims  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms or that our insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential claims 
a successful uninsured product liability or other claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects
