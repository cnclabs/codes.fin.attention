you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  included elsewhere in this annual report as well as other reports we file with the securities and exchange commission 
amkor is the world s largest subcontractor of semiconductor packaging and test services 
the company has built a leading position by providing a broad portfolio of packaging and test technologies and services  maintaining a leading role in the design and development of new package and test technologies  cultivating long standing relationships with customers  including many of the world s leading semiconductor companies  developing expertise in high volume manufacturing  and diversifying our operational scope by establishing production capabilities in china  japan and taiwan  in addition to long standing capabilities in korea and the philippines 
the semiconductors that we package and test for our customers ultimately become components in electric systems used in communications  computing  consumer  industrial  automotive and military applications 
our customers include  among others  agilent technologies  atmel corporation  intel corporation  lsi logic corporation  mediatek inc  philips electronics nv  rf microdevices  st microelectronics pte  sony semiconductor corporation and toshiba corporation 
the outsourced semiconductor packaging and test market is very competitive 
we also compete with the internal semiconductor packaging and test capabilities of many of our customers 
packaging and test are an integral part of the semiconductor manufacturing process 
semiconductor manufacturing begins with silicon wafers and involves the fabrication of electronic circuitry into complex patterns  thus creating individual chips on the wafers 
the packaging process creates an electrical interconnect between the semiconductor chip and the system board 
in packaging  the fabricated semiconductor wafers are cut into individual chips which are then attached to a substrate and encased in a protective material to provide optimal electrical and thermal performance 
increasingly  packages are custom designed for specific chips and specific end market applications 
the packaged chips are then tested using sophisticated equipment to ensure that each packaged chip meets its design specifications 
we historically marketed the output of fabricated semiconductor wafers provided by a wafer fabrication foundry owned and operated by anam semiconductor  inc asi 
on february   we sold our wafer fabrication services business to asi 
beginning with the first quarter of  we will reflect our wafer fabrication services segment as a discontinued operation and restate our historical results 
our business is tied to market conditions in the semiconductor industry  which is highly cyclical 
based on industry estimates  from through  there were years when semiconductor industry growth  measured by revenue dollars  was or less and years when growth was or greater 
since  the semiconductor industry declined in   and the semiconductor industry declined an unprecedented in and experienced a growth in as compared to the historical trends in the semiconductor industry are not necessarily indicative of the results of any future period 
semiconductor industry analysts are forecasting significant growth in the semiconductor industry in each of and the strength of the semiconductor industry is dependent primarily upon the strength of the computer and communications systems markets as well as the strength of the worldwide economy 
although significant recovery was noted in our company s core packaging services during the second quarter of  our test services assets and several non core packaging services assets remained at low utilization rates relative to our projections  and are no longer expected to reach previously anticipated utilization levels 
we recognized total impairment charges of million during the second quarter of the nature of the impairment charges was as follows million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the test and packaging assets to be disposed to their fair value less cost to sell  million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of test assets and certain non core packaging assets that are held and used to fair value  and million goodwill impairment charge associated with our test services reporting unit 
the first calendar quarter is typically a seasonally down quarter for amkor 
on the basis of customers forecasts  we currently expect packaging and test revenue for the first quarter of to be around lower than packaging and test revenues for the fourth quarter of we expect that first quarter of gross margin will be around 
our profitability is dependent upon the utilization of our capacity  semiconductor package mix and the average selling price of our services 
because a substantial portion of our costs at our factories is fixed  relatively insignificant increases or decreases in capacity utilization rates can have a significant effect on our profitability 
prices for packaging and test services and wafer fabrication services have declined over time 
historically  we have been able to partially offset the effect of price declines by successfully developing and marketing new packages with higher prices  such as advanced leadframe and laminate packages  by negotiating lower prices with our material vendors  and by driving engineering and technological changes in our packaging and test processes which resulted in reduced manufacturing costs 
we expect that average selling prices for our packaging and test services will continue to decline in the future 
if our semiconductor package mix does not shift to new technologies with higher prices or we cannot reduce the cost of our packaging and test services to offset a decline in average selling prices  our future operating results will suffer 
average selling prices for declined as compared to average selling prices in average selling prices for declined as compared to average selling prices in these declines in average selling prices significantly impacted our gross margins in and overview of our historical results our historical relationship with asi historically we performed packaging and test services at our factories in the philippines and subcontracted for additional services with asi  which operated four packaging and test facilities in korea 
beginning in the fourth quarter of asi s business was severely affected by the economic crisis in korea 
asi was part of the korean financial restructuring program known as the workout program beginning in october the workout program was the result of an accord among korean financial institutions to assist in the restructuring of korean business enterprises 
the process involved negotiation between asi s banks and asi  and did not involve the judicial system 
the workout process restructured the terms of asi s significant bank debt 
although asi s operations continued uninterrupted during the process  it caused concern among our customers that we could potentially lose access to asi s services 
as a result  we decided to acquire asi s packaging and test operations to ensure continued access to the manufacturing services previously provided by asi 
during the course of negotiations for the purchase of the packaging and test operations  both asi management and the asi bank group presented a counter proposal whereby  in addition to the purchase of the packaging and test operations  we would also make an equity investment in asi 
the bank group and asi management proposed this structure because they believed the equity investment would reflect a level of commitment from us to continue our ongoing business relationship with asi after the sale of its packaging and test operations to amkor 
in may  we acquired k  one of asi s packaging and test facilities  and in may we acquired asi s remaining packaging and test facilities  k  k and k with the completion of our acquisition of k  k and k  we no longer depend upon asi for packaging or test services 
in may we also committed to a million equity investment in asi  and fulfilled this commitment in installments taking place over the course of in connection with the may transactions with asi  we obtained independent appraisals to support the value and purchase price of each the packaging and test operations and the equity investment 
we invested a total of million in asi including an equity investment of million made in october and  as a result acquired a total of million shares of asi common stock 
as part of our strategy to sell our investment in asi and to divest our wafer fabrication services business  we entered into a series of transactions beginning in the second half of in september  we sold million shares of asi common stock to dongbu group for million in net cash proceeds and billion korean won approximately million at a spot exchange rate as of december  of interest bearing notes from dongbu corporation payable in two equal principal payments in september and february the dongbu group comprises dongbu corporation  dongbu fire insurance co  ltd 
and dongbu life insurance co  ltd  all of which are korean corporations and are collectively referred herein as dongbu 
additionally  we divested one million shares of asi common stock in connection with the payment of certain advisory fees related to this transaction 
as of february   we sold our wafer fabrication services business to asi for total consideration of million 
in separate transactions designed to facilitate a future merger between asi and dongbu  i we acquired a interest in acqutek from asi for million  ii we acquired the precision machine division pmd of anam instruments  a related party to amkor  for million  and iii anam instruments  which had been partially owned by asi  utilized the proceeds from the sale of pmd to us to buy back all of the anam instruments shares owned by asi 
acqutek supplies materials to the semiconductor industry and is publicly traded in korea 
an entity controlled by the family of james kim  our chairman and chief executive officer  held a ownership interest in acqutek at the time of our acquisition of our interest in acqutek 
we have historically purchased and continue to purchase leadframes from acqutek 
pmd supplies sophisticated die mold systems and tooling to the semiconductor industry and historically over of its sales were to amkor 
at the time of our acquisition of pmd  anam instruments was owned by asi and by a family member of james kim 
each of the transactions with dongbu  asi and anam instruments are interrelated and it is possible that if each of the transactions were viewed on a stand alone basis without regard to the other transactions  we could have had different conclusions as to fair value 
as of february   we sold our wafer fabrication services business to asi 
additionally  we obtained a release from texas instruments regarding our contractual obligations with respect to wafer fabrication services to be performed subsequent to the transfer of the business to asi 
beginning with the first quarter of  we will reflect our wafer fabrication services segment as a discontinued operation and restate our historical results 
we no longer benefit from the income from operations and cash flows of our wafer fabrication services segment 
the historical results of our wafer fabrication services segment are as follows in thousands net revenues    gross profit    operating income    depreciation expense    capital expenditures  total assets    in connection with the disposition of our wafer fabrication business  we expect to incur an estimated million in severance and other exit costs to close our wafer fabrication services operations in boise  idaho and lyon  france 
we estimate that in the first quarter of we will recognize a pre tax net gain on the disposition of our wafer fabrication services business approximately million 
the carrying value of the disposed net assets associated with the business as of february  was million 
in addition  pursuant to the definitive agreements  amkor and dongbu agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause dongbu electronics and asi to be merged together as soon as practicable  amkor and dongbu agreed to cause asi to use the proceeds asi received from its sale of stock to dongbu to purchase shares in dongbu electronics and amkor and dongbu agreed to use their best efforts to provide releases and indemnifications to the chairman  directors and officers of asi  either past or incumbent  from any and all liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties at asi between january  and december  the last provision would provide a release and indemnification for james kim  our ceo and chairman  and members of his family 
we are not aware of any claims or other liabilities which these individuals would be released from or for which they would receive indemnification 
at january  amkor owned million shares or of asi s voting stock 
during  we divested million shares of asi stock and at december  amkor owned million shares of asi or 
the carrying value of our remaining investment in asi at december  was million  or per share 
on march   we sold an additional million shares of asi common stock to an investment bank for billion korean won million based on the spot exchange rate as of the transaction date which approximates the carrying value of those shares 
as part of that sale  we purchased a nondeliverable call option for million that expires december and is indexed to asi s share price with a strike price of per share 
the net proceeds from the exercise of the option could be less than the current carrying value and could expire unexercised losing our entire investment in the option 
as of march   we owned million shares of asi  or of asi s voting stock 
beginning march   we ceased accounting for our investment in asi under the equity method of accounting and commenced accounting for our investment as a marketable security that is available for sale 
our acquisitions in april  we acquired the semiconductor packaging business of citizen watch co  ltd 
located in the iwate prefecture in japan 
the business acquired includes a manufacturing facility  over employees and intellectual property 
the purchase price included a million cash payment at closing 
we are required to make additional payments one year from closing for the amount of the deferred purchase price as well as contingent payments 
based on the resolution of the contingency as of january  the total amount of additional payments due in april is billion japanese yen million based on the spot exchange rate at december  
we recorded million of intangible assets for patent rights that are amortizable over years 
in january  we acquired agilent technologies  inc s packaging business related to semiconductor packages utilized in printers for million in cash 
the acquired tangible assets were integrated into our existing manufacturing facilities 
the purchase price was principally allocated to the tangible assets 
our results of operations were not significantly impacted by this acquisition 
in october  we terminated negotiations with fujitsu limited to acquire fujitsu s packaging and test operation in kagoshima  japan pursuant to the april memorandum of understanding between our company and fujitsu 
our venture with toshiba corporation as of january   amkor iwate corporation commenced operations with the acquisition of a packaging and test facility at a toshiba factory located in the iwate prefecture in japan 
we currently own of amkor iwate and toshiba owns the balance of the outstanding shares 
by january we are required to purchase the remaining of the outstanding shares of amkor iwate from toshiba 
the share purchase price will be determined based on the performance of the venture during the three year period but cannot be less than billion japanese yen and cannot exceed billion japanese yen million to million based on the spot exchange rate at december  
amkor iwate provides packaging and test services principally to toshiba s iwate factory under a long term supply agreement that provides for services to be performed on a cost plus basis during the term of the joint venture and subsequently at market based rates 
the supply agreement with toshiba s iwate factory terminates two years subsequent to our acquisition of toshiba s ownership interest in amkor iwate 
our acquisitions of taiwan semiconductor technology corporation and sampo semiconductor corporation in july  we acquired  in separate transactions  taiwan semiconductor technology corporation tstc and sampo semiconductor corporation ssc in taiwan 
the results of tstc and ssc have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the acquisition dates 
our results of operations were not significantly impacted by these acquisitions 
in connection with earn out provisions that provided for additional purchase price based in part on the results of the acquisitions  we issued an additional million shares in january and recorded an additional million in goodwill 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  net revenues gross profit operating income loss income loss before income taxes  equity in income loss of investees and minority interest net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues increased million  or  to  million in from  million in packaging and test net revenues increased to  million in from  million in wafer fabrication net revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in packaging and test net revenues for  excluding the impact of our acquisitions and expansion in japan  taiwan and china  was principally attributed to an overall unit volumes increase of which was driven by a increase for advanced packages and a increase in our traditional packages 
partially offsetting the volume increases  average selling prices for declined as compared to average selling prices in the revenues of our japanese acquisition  amkor iwate  declined million in compared to our acquisitions in taiwan and expansion into china contributed million to the increase in net revenues for prices for packaging and test services and wafer fabrication services have declined over time 
historically  we have been able to partially offset the effect of price declines by successfully developing and marketing new packages with higher prices  such as advanced leadframe and laminate packages  by negotiating lower prices with our material vendors  and by driving engineering and technological changes in our packaging and test processes which resulted in reduced manufacturing costs 
during  the decline in average selling prices significantly impacted our gross margins as compared to the comparable period a year ago 
the increase in wafer fabrication net revenues was primarily attributed to a increase in sales to texas instruments in as compared with partially offset by a decrease in demand from our other wafer fabrication services customers 
we derived and of our wafer fabrication revenues from texas instruments for and  respectively 
on february   we sold our wafer fabrication services business to asi 
additionally  we obtained a release from texas instruments regarding our contractual obligations with respect to wafer fabrication services to be performed subsequent to the transfer of the business to asi 
beginning with the first quarter of  we will reflect our wafer fabrication services segment as a discontinued operation and restate our historical results 
gross profit loss 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in our cost of revenues consists principally of costs of materials  labor and depreciation 
because a substantial portion of our costs at our factories is fixed  relatively insignificant increases or decreases in capacity utilization rates can have a significant effect on our gross margin 
as a result of acquisitions in japan and taiwan in as well as other geographic expansions  we substantially increased our fixed costs 
gross margins as a percentage of net revenues increased percentage points to in as compared to in principally as a result of the following increased capacity utilization as a result of increased unit volumes at our factories in korea and the philippines together with the impact of our cost savings initiatives at those factories caused an approximate percentage point increase in gross margins 
material cost savings contributed approximately percentage points to the increase in gross margins 
reduced depreciation expense of approximately million as a result of the impact of the fixed asset impairment charge recorded as of june  caused an approximate percentage points increase in gross margins 
a discussion of the second quarter impairment charge is presented within the discussion of special charges below 
reduced depreciation expense of approximately million as a result of the impact of the change in estimated useful lives of certain packaging equipment beginning with the fourth quarter of caused an approximate percentage point increase in gross margins 
a discussion of the change in estimated useful lives is set forth below 
the positive impacts on gross margins were partially offset by average selling price erosion across our product lines caused an estimated percentage points decline in gross margins 
our acquisitions in taiwan and expansion into china contributed approximately percentage points to the decline in gross margin as a result of the costs associated with ramping and reconfiguring operations at these facilities 
depreciation accounting requires estimation of the useful lives of the assets to be depreciated as well as adoption of a method of depreciation 
we calculate depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets 
we have historically estimated the useful lives of our machinery and equipment to be three to five years  with the substantial majority of our packaging assets having estimated useful lives of four years 
effective with the fourth quarter of  we changed the estimated useful lives of certain of our packaging equipment from four years to seven years for depreciation purposes  which is in line with our historical usage and consistent with other companies in our industry 
we did not extend the useful lives of the packaging equipment associated with the second quarter impairment charge based on our expected use of that equipment and the associated cash flows 
this change decreased our net loss by approximately million  or per share 
there was no offsetting impact to our tax provision related to the change in useful lives because of our consolidated net losses for and our recognition of a valuation allowance against the associated net operating loss carryforwards 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in the decrease in these costs was largely attributed to million in cost reductions principally related to our us based administrative overhead cost reduction initiatives  partially offset by million for increased administrative costs related to our factories 
our factory administrative expenses increased overall as a result of our and acquisitions offset by factory cost reduction initiatives 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in our research and development efforts support our customers needs for smaller packages and increased functionality 
we continue to invest our research and development resources to further the development of flip chip interconnection solutions  chip scale packages that are nearly the size of the semiconductor die  micro electromechanical system mems devices used in a variety of end markets including automotive  industrial and personal entertainment  our stacked chip packages that stack as many as three semiconductor dies in a single package  and system in package technology  that uses both advanced packaging and traditional surface mount techniques to enable the combination of technologies in a single chip 
amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we reclassified million of intangible assets previously identified as an assembled workforce intangible to goodwill 
additionally  we stopped amortizing goodwill of million 
the cessation of amortization reduced amortization expense by million for as compared with special charges 
during  we recorded million of special charges 
special charges  in thousands  were comprised of impairment of long lived assets  impairment of goodwill  lease termination and other exit costs  although significant recovery was noted in our company s core packaging services during the second quarter of  our test services assets and several non core packaging services assets remained at low utilization rates relative to our projections  and are no longer expected to reach previously anticipated utilization levels 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization 
these events triggered an impairment review in accordance with sfas no 
this review included a company wide evaluation of underutilized assets that could be sold and a detailed update of our operating and cash flow projections 
as a result of this analysis  we identified million of test and packaging fixed assets to be disposed 
we recognized an million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the test and packaging fixed assets to be disposed to their fair value less cost to sell 
fair value of the assets to be disposed was determined with the assistance of an appraisal firm and available information on the resale value of the equipment 
additionally  we tested for impairment our long lived test assets that are held and used  including intangible assets that we are amortizing  and certain non core packaging fixed assets that are held and used 
for the test and packaging assets that are held and used  we recognized a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of those assets to fair value 
an appraisal firm was engaged to assist in the determination of the fair value of the assets held for use 
the determination of fair value was based on projected cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved 
sfas no 
provides that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances including a significant adverse change in the business climate and testing for recoverability of long lived assets 
accordingly  we retested goodwill for impairment as of june   and concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the test services reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
as of june   we recognized a million goodwill impairment charge 
such impairment charge was measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the test services reporting unit to its carrying value 
an appraisal firm was engaged to assist in the determination of the fair value of our reporting units 
the determination of fair value was based on projected cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved 
during  we recorded million of charges related to the consolidation of our worldwide facilities to increase operational efficiency and reduce costs 
the charges were comprised of million to write off leasehold improvements and other long lived assets and million for lease termination and other exit costs 
our consolidation efforts included transferring the packaging operations at our k site in bucheon  south korea into our k factory in kwangju  south korea and closing the k facility  merging our factory operations in taiwan into a single location  and consolidating select us office locations and closing our san jose test facility 
the charges associated with the consolidation initiatives in korea  taiwan and the us were million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to complete the closing of the k facility during the second quarter of and the other activities were substantially completed during we have undertaken  and may continue to undertake  a variety of measures to reduce our operating costs including consolidating packaging lines  reducing our worldwide headcount  reducing compensation levels  shortening work schedules  improving factory efficiencies  negotiating cost reductions with our vendors and closing non critical manufacturing facilities 
other income expense 
other expenses  net decreased million  to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in the net decrease in other expenses was primarily a result of a decrease in interest expense of million 
net interest expense in included million of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs expensed in connection with the repayment in february  may and november of term loans outstanding under our secured bank facility and the reduction of the revolving line of credit commitment 
provision benefit for income taxes 
during  we recorded a million charge to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets consisting primarily of us and taiwanese net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
in connection with our divestiture in of million shares of asi common stock  we realized a capital loss of approximately million and recognized a us tax benefit of million for which we provided a full valuation allowance because we did not have any offsetting capital gains 
the total change in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was million in generally accepted accounting principles require companies to weigh both positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in light of our three years of cumulative losses  an unprecedented industry downturn and continued poor visibility of customer demand  we determined in the fourth quarter that a valuation allowance representing substantially all of our deferred tax assets was appropriate 
these negative factors outweighed our forecasted future profitability and expectation that we will be able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
we will resume the recognition of deferred tax assets when we return to profitability 
additionally  until we utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  the income tax provision will reflect modest levels of foreign taxation 
in december  we utilized million of us net operating losses by carrying back such amounts to offset us reported taxable income in prior years 
at december   our company has remaining us net operating losses available to be carried forward totaling million expiring between and additionally  at december   our company had non us net operating losses available to be carried forward totaling million expiring between and equity in loss of investees 
our earnings included our share of losses in our equity affiliates  principally asi  in of million compared to million million excluding the amortization of equity method goodwill in as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we stopped amortizing equity method goodwill of million associated with our investment in asi 
the cessation of amortization reduced equity in loss of investees by million for as compared with the corresponding period 
during  we recorded impairment charges totaling million to reduce the carrying value of our investment in asi to asi s market value 
additionally during  we recorded a loss of million on the disposition of a portion of our interest in asi to dongbu 
with dongbu s purchase of million newly issued shares of asi together with its purchase of million shares from our company and our disposition of an additional million shares of asi stock as payment of transaction costs to our financial advisors in connection with the transaction with dongbu  our ownership interest in asi was reduced to approximately 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues decreased million  or  to  million in from  million in packaging and test net revenues decreased to  million in from  million in wafer fabrication net revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease in packaging and test net revenues  excluding the impact of acquisitions  was primarily attributable to a decrease in overall unit volumes in compared to this overall unit volume decrease was driven by a unit volume decrease for advanced leadframe and laminate packages and a decrease in our traditional leadframe business as a result of a broad based decrease in demand for semiconductors 
average selling prices across all product lines eroded by approximately for as compared to partially offsetting the decrease in overall unit volumes and average selling price erosion was the benefit of million in net revenues related to acquisitions which were completed since january  the decrease in wafer fabrication net revenues was primarily attributed to a decrease in sales to texas instruments in as compared with texas instruments demand for our services declined as a result of the utilization of excess inventory supply and a decline in end market demand for cellular phones 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million in from in our cost of revenues consists principally of costs of materials  labor and depreciation 
because a substantial portion of our costs at our factories is fixed  significant increases or decreases in capacity utilization rates have a significant effect on our gross profit 
as a result of our may acquisition of k  k and k and our acquisitions in japan and taiwan  we substantially increased our fixed costs 
gross margins as a percentage of net revenues decreased to of net revenues in as compared to of net revenues in principally as a result the following decreasing unit volumes in at our factories in korea and the philippines that caused an approximate decline in gross margins as a result of the factories substantial fixed and labor costs to be distributed over a smaller revenue base 
this decline in gross margins is net of the benefit of our cost reduction initiatives to reduce labor and other factory overhead costs 
average selling price erosion across our product lines caused an estimated decline in gross margins 
our acquisitions in contributed approximately to the decline in gross margin 
this is principally attributed to the long term supply agreement between amkor iwate and toshiba  which provides for packaging and test services to be performed on a cost plus basis which produces a resulting gross margin less than our historical margins in the negative impacts on gross margins were partially offset by the benefit of stable gross margins with respect to our wafer fabrication services as compared to as a result of the decline in the semiconductor industry and the reductions of our customers forecasted demand  our provision for excess and obsolete inventory increased million to a total provision of million in as compared to million in during  we wrote off and contemporaneously disposed of million of inventory 
in general we order raw materials based on the customers forecasted demand and we do not maintain any finished goods inventory 
if our customers change their forecasted requirements and we are unable to cancel our raw materials order or if our vendors require that we order a minimum quantity that exceeds the current forecasted demand  we will experience a build up in raw material inventory 
we will either seek to recover the cost of the materials from our customers or utilize the inventory in production 
however  we may not be successful in recovering the cost from our customers or being able to use the inventory in production  which we would consider as part of our reserve estimate 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is based on forecasted demand we receive from our customers 
when a determination is made that the inventory will not be utilized in production it is written off and disposed 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in the increase in these costs was due to increased costs of million related to the acquisitions in japan and taiwan  the commencement of operations in china and the increased staffing of our japanese sales force  an overall decrease of million in our factories in korea and the philippines as a result of our cost reduction initiatives in the first and second quarters of that were partially offset by the increased selling  general and administrative costs assumed in connection our may acquisition of k  k and k  and decreased costs of million principally related our us based administrative overhead cost reduction initiatives in the first and second quarters of research and development 
research and development expenses increased million to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in increased research and development expenses resulted from the acquisition of the packaging and test research and development group within asi related to the k  k and k transaction 
our research and development efforts support our customers needs for smaller packages and increased functionality 
we continue to invest our research and development resources to continue the development of our flip chip interconnection solutions  our system in package technology  that uses both advanced packaging and traditional surface mount techniques to enable the combination of technologies in a single package  and our chip scale packages that are nearly the size of the semiconductor die 
amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangibles increased million to million from million in principally as a result of our may acquisition of k  k and k and to a lesser extent our january acquisition of amkor iwate 
loss on disposal of fixed assets 
loss on disposal of fixed assets increased million to million from million in principally as a result of the disposition of production equipment and construction materials in korea 
other income expense 
other expenses  net increased million  to million  or of net revenues  in from million  or of net revenues  in the net increase in other expenses was primarily a result of a net increase in interest expense of million 
the increased interest expense resulted from the financing related to our may acquisition of k  k and k and our investment in asi and our financing activities 
net interest expense for also included million of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs expensed in connection with the repayment in february  may and november of term loans outstanding under our secured bank facility and the reduction of the revolving line of credit commitment 
other expenses were favorably impacted by a change in foreign currency gains and losses of million for as compared with the corresponding period in the prior year 
provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax rate in and was and  respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate in was due to operating losses in jurisdictions for which there is no offsetting tax benefit from tax holidays as well as operating losses in jurisdictions with higher corporate income tax rates 
the tax returns for open years are subject to changes upon final examination 
changes in the mix of income from our foreign subsidiaries  expiration of tax holidays and changes in tax laws and regulations could result in increased effective tax rates for us in the future 
equity in loss of investees 
our earnings included our share of losses in our equity affiliates  principally asi  in of million compared to our share of their income in of million 
our earnings also included the amortization of the excess of the cost of our investment above of our share of the underlying net assets of million and million in and  respectively 
our investment in asi increased to as of october from as of september  as of may and as of october quarterly results the following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated financial data  including as a percentage of our net revenues  for the last eight fiscal quarters ended december  our results of operations have varied and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter and are not necessarily indicative of the results of any future period 
the results of the semiconductor packaging businesses acquired from citizen watch co  ltd 
and agilent technologies  inc s in are included in the consolidated financial data from the date of the acquisitions 
the results of the acquisitions of amkor iwate corporation  sampo semiconductor corporation and the consolidated results of taiwan semiconductor technology corporation a prior equity investment are included in the consolidated financial data from the date of the acquisitions 
we believe that we have included in the amounts stated below all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  for a fair presentation of our selected quarterly data 
you should read our selected quarterly data in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  included elsewhere in this annual report 
our net revenues  gross profit and operating income are generally lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year primarily due to the combined effect of holidays in the us and asia 
semiconductor companies in the us generally reduce their production during the holidays at the end of december which results in a significant decrease in orders for packaging and test services during the first two weeks of january 
in addition  we typically close our factories in the philippines for holidays in january  and we close our factories in korea for holidays in february 
the calculation of basic and diluted net income loss per share for each quarter is based on the average shares outstanding for that period  consequently  the sum of the quarters may not necessarily be equal to the full year basic and diluted net income loss per share

 june  march  in thousands operating activities         investing activities         financing activities         the significant improvement in our operating cash flows during was as a result of increase in demand for our services  the effect of our cost savings initiatives and favorable impact to working capital of million principally related to processing fees payable to asi under the foundry agreement which we retained in anticipation of completing the sale of our wafer foundry business to asi 
our cash and cash equivalents balance as of december  was million  and we have up to million available under our million revolving line of credit which is subject to borrowing base of qualified receivables 
our ongoing primary cash needs are for debt service  principally interest  equipment purchases  and working capital 
additionally  we may require cash to consummate business combinations to diversify our geographic operations and expand our customer base 
in june and september we amended our existing bank debt covenants to provide further flexibility with respect to capital expenditures  investment restrictions and other financial covenants measured in part by our liquidity and earnings 
as part of the september amendment  lenders under our bank credit facility agreed to extend the existing financial covenant framework through december  our secured debt encompasses a million term loan and the unused revolving line of credit 
the term loan maintained its scheduled amortization of approximately million per quarter through september and then million per quarter beginning in december through september the bank credit facility will revert to its original covenant structure in january additionally  the reduced levels of our operating cash flow in required us to renegotiate our bank debt covenants in march  june and september in connection with the september amendment  our revolving line of credit was reduced from a million commitment to million  the interest rate on the term b loans was increased from libor plus to libor plus  and we prepaid million of the term b loans in november from cash on hand 
in general  covenants in the agreements governing our existing debt  and debt we may incur in the future  may materially restrict our operations  including our ability to incur debt  pay dividends  make certain investments and payments and encumber or dispose of assets 
in addition  financial covenants contained in agreements relating to our existing and future debt could lead to a default in the event our results of operations do not meet our plans and we are unable to amend such financial covenants prior to default 
a default under one debt instrument may also trigger cross defaults under our other debt instruments 
an event of default under one or more of our debt instruments  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
our credit and debt ratings were lowered in august  and accordingly  it may be difficult for us to secure additional financing  if we need it  on satisfactory terms or at all 
during this industry downturn  our business strategy has been in part to enhance our financial flexibility 
in february and may  we raised million through the sale of senior notes due and million through the sale of convertible subordinated notes due  respectively 
of the combined net proceeds of million  we used million to repay amortizing term loans under our secured credit facility 
the balance of the net proceeds supports our expansion efforts and general corporate and working capital purposes 
in may holders of the convertible subordinated notes due may  following our announced plan to redeem these notes  converted million of their notes into million shares of our common stock 
we now have  and for the foreseeable future will continue to have  a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of december   we had total debt of  million debt and had available to us a million revolving line of credit  which is subject to borrowing base of qualified receivables  under which no amounts were drawn 
our indebtedness requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service payments on our debt  with such payments principally for interest 
for  interest expense payable in cash was million 
we expect to spend up to million in capital expenditures in during  and  we made capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
our capital expenditures in were focused on increasing capacity for microleadframe tm  flip chip and digital micro mirror devices 
we continue to diversify our operations geographically 
in january  we acquired agilent technologies  inc s packaging business related to semiconductor packages utilized in printers for million in cash 
the purchase price was principally allocated to the tangible assets 
in april  we acquired the semiconductor packaging business of citizen watch co  ltd 
located in the iwate prefecture in japan 
the business acquired includes a manufacturing facility  over employees and intellectual property 
the purchase price included a million cash payment at closing and we are required to make additional payments one year from closing for the amount of the deferred purchase price as well as contingent payments 
based on the resolution of the contingency as of january  the total amount of additional payments due in april is billion japanese yen million based on the spot exchange rate at december  
in october  we terminated negotiations with fujitsu limited to acquire fujitsu s packaging and test operation in kagoshima  japan pursuant to the april memorandum of understanding between our company and fujitsu 
in july  we acquired  in separate transactions  taiwan semiconductor technology corporation tstc and sampo semiconductor corporation ssc in taiwan 
the combined purchase price  including the settlement of a january earn out provision  was paid with the issuance of million shares of our common stock valued at million  the assumption of million of debt and million of cash consideration  net of acquired cash 
in january  amkor iwate corporation commenced operations and acquired from toshiba a packaging and test facility located in the iwate prefecture in japan financed by a short term note payable to toshiba of million and million in other financing from a toshiba affiliate 
we currently own of amkor iwate and toshiba owns of the outstanding shares  which shares we are required to purchase by january the share purchase price will be determined based on the historical performance of the joint venture  but cannot be less than billion japanese yen and cannot exceed billion japanese yen million to million based on the spot exchange rate at december  as part of our strategy to sell our investment in asi and to divest our wafer fabrication services business  we entered into a series of transactions beginning in the second half of in september  we sold million shares of asi common stock to dongbu group for million in net cash proceeds and billion korean won approximately million at a spot exchange rate as of december  of interest bearing notes from dongbu corporation payable in two equal principal payments in september and february the dongbu group comprises dongbu corporation  dongbu fire insurance co  ltd 
and dongbu life insurance co  ltd  all of which are korean corporations and are collectively referred herein as dongbu 
additionally  we divested one million shares of asi common stock in connection with the payment of certain advisory fees related to this transaction 
as of february   we sold our wafer fabrication services business to asi for total consideration of million 
in separate transactions designed to facilitate a future merger between asi and dongbu  i we acquired a interest in acqutek from asi for million  ii we acquired the precision machine division pmd of anam instruments  a related party to amkor  for million  and iii anam instruments  which had been partially owned by asi  utilized the proceeds from the sale of pmd to us to buy back all of the anam instruments shares owned by asi 
acqutek supplies materials to the semiconductor industry and is publicly traded in korea 
an entity controlled by the family of james kim  our chairman and chief executive officer  held a ownership interest in acqutek at the time of our acquisition of our interest in acqutek 
we have historically purchased and continue to purchase leadframes from acqutek 
pmd supplies sophisticated die mold systems and tooling to the semiconductor industry and historically over of its sales were to amkor 
at the time of our acquisition of pmd  anam instruments was owned by asi and by a family member of james kim 
as of february   we sold our wafer fabrication services business to asi 
additionally  we obtained a release from texas instruments regarding our contractual obligations with respect to wafer fabrication services to be performed subsequent to the transfer of the business to asi 
we will reflect our wafer fabrication services segment as a discontinued operation as of the first quarter of in connection with the disposition of our wafer fabrication business  we expect to incur an estimated million in severance and other exit costs to close our wafer fabrication services operations in boise  idaho and lyon  france 
the net proceeds from our sale of asi stock to dongbu as well as from the sale of our wafer foundry services will be reinvested into our company pursuant to the requirements of our senior note indentures 
at january  amkor owned million shares or of asi s voting stock 
during  we divested million shares of asi stock and at december  amkor owned million shares of asi or 
on march   we sold an additional million shares of asi common stock to an investment bank for billion korean won million based on the spot exchange rate as of the transaction date which approximates the carrying value of those shares 
as part of that sale  we purchased a nondeliverable call option for million that expires december and is indexed to asi s share price with a strike price of per share 
the net proceeds from the exercise of the option could be less than the current carrying value and could expire unexercised losing our entire investment in the option 
as of march   we owned million shares of asi  or of asi s voting stock 
beginning march   we ceased accounting for our investment in asi under the equity method of accounting and commenced accounting for our investment as a marketable security that is available for sale 
we intend to sell our remaining investment in asi 
the ultimate level of proceeds from the sale of our remaining investment in asi could be less than the current carrying value 
we believe that our existing cash balances  available credit lines  cash flow from operations and available equipment lease financing will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures  debt service  working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we may require capital sooner than currently expected 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when we need it or  if available  that it will be available on satisfactory terms 
in addition  the terms of the secured bank facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes significantly reduce our ability to incur additional debt 
failure to obtain any such required additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our company 
a summary of our contractual commitments as of december  are as follows year ending december  total after in thousands total debt  including capital lease obligations      operating lease obligations      total contractual obligations      we have a million revolving line of credit through march of which the entire balance was available as of december  we are required to purchased toshiba s ownership interest in amkor iwate by january  at a purchase price that will be determined based on the historical performance of the joint venture but cannot be less than billion japanese yen and cannot exceed billion japanese yen million to million based on the spot exchange rate at december  
additionally  in connection with our acquisition of a semiconductor packaging business from citizen watch co  ltd 
we are required to make additional payments one year from closing for the amount of the deferred purchase price as well as contingent payments 
based on the resolution of the contingency as of january  the total amount of additional payments due in april is billion japanese yen million based on the spot exchange rate at december  
such amount was accrued as of the acquisition date and is reflected as a liability on our balance sheet as of december  we have committed by january to purchase for million japanese yen  or million at current exchange rates  a tract of land adjacent to the amkor iwate facility that is currently being leased 
this commitment can be terminated for approximately million 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
a summary of our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements appears in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and risk of loss 
revenues from packaging semiconductors and performing test services are recognized upon shipment or completion of the services 
our company does not take ownership of customer supplied semiconductor wafers 
title and risk of loss remains with the customer for these materials at all times 
accordingly  the cost of the customer supplied materials is not included in the consolidated financial statements 
prior to the sales of our wafer fabrication services business on february   we recorded wafer fabrication services revenues upon shipment of completed wafers 
such policies are consistent with provisions in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
provision for income taxes 
we operate in and file income tax returns in various us and us jurisdictions which are subject to examination by tax authorities 
our tax returns have been examined through in the philippines and the us  through in japan  through in taiwan and through in china 
the tax returns for open years in all jurisdictions in which we do business are subject to changes upon examination 
we believe that we have estimated and provided adequate accruals for the probable additional taxes and related interest expense that may ultimately result from examinations related to our transfer pricing and local attribution of income resulting from significant intercompany transactions  including ownership and use of intellectual property  in various us and us jurisdictions 
our estimated tax liability is subject to change as examinations of specific tax years are completed in the respective jurisdictions 
we believe that any additional taxes or related interest over the amounts accrued will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations  nor do we expect that examinations to be completed in the near term would have a material effect 
as of december  and  the accrual for current taxes and estimated additional taxes was million and million  respectively 
in addition  changes in the mix of income from our foreign subsidiaries  expiration of tax holidays and changes in tax laws or regulations could result in increased effective tax rates in the future 
additionally  we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
during  we recorded a million charge to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets consisting primarily of us and taiwanese net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
in connection with our divestiture in of million shares of asi common stock  we realized a capital loss of approximately million and recognized a us tax benefit of million for which we provided a full valuation allowance because we did not have any offsetting capital gains 
the total change in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was million in generally accepted accounting principles require companies to weigh both positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in light of our three years of cumulative losses  an unprecedented industry downturn and continued poor visibility of customer demand  we determined in the fourth quarter that a valuation allowance representing substantially all of our deferred tax assets was appropriate 
these negative factors outweighed our forecasted future profitability and expectation that we will be able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
we will resume the recognition of deferred tax assets when we return to profitability 
additionally  until we utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  the income tax provision will reflect modest levels of foreign taxation 
in december  we utilized million of us net operating losses by carrying back such amounts to offset us reported taxable income in prior years 
at december   our company has remaining us net operating losses available to be carried forward totaling million expiring between and additionally  at december   our company had non us net operating losses available to be carried forward totaling million expiring between and valuation of long lived assets 
we assess the carrying value of long lived assets which includes property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would test such assets for a potential impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
although significant recovery was noted in our company s core packaging services during the second quarter of  our test services assets and several non core packaging services assets remained at low utilization rates relative to our projections  and are no longer expected to reach previously anticipated utilization levels 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization 
these events triggered an impairment review in accordance with sfas no 
this review included a company wide evaluation of underutilized assets that could be sold and a detailed update of our operating and cash flow projections 
as a result of this analysis  we identified million of test and packaging fixed assets to be disposed 
we recognized an million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the test and packaging fixed assets to be disposed to their fair value less cost to sell 
fair value of the assets to be disposed was determined with the assistance of an appraisal firm and available information on the resale value of the equipment 
additionally  we tested for impairment our long lived test assets that are held and used  including intangible assets that we are amortizing  and certain non core packaging fixed assets that are held and used 
for the test and packaging assets that are held and used  we recognized a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of those assets to fair value 
an appraisal firm was engaged to assist in the determination of the fair value of the assets held for use 
the determination of fair value was based on projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we ceased amortization of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill as of january  and then on an annual basis or between annual tests in certain circumstances including a significant adverse change in the business climate and testing for recoverability of long lived assets 
based on the comparison of the fair value of the reporting units with their respective carrying values each as of january   we concluded that goodwill associated with our packaging and test services reporting units was not impaired as of adoption 
since we tested our long lived assets for recoverability as of june   we retested goodwill for impairment as of june   and concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated with the test services reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
as of june   we recognized a million goodwill impairment charge 
such impairment charge was measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the test services reporting unit to its carrying value 
an appraisal firm was engaged to assist in the determination of the fair value of our reporting units 
the determination of fair value was based on projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
depreciation accounting requires estimation of the useful lives of the assets to be depreciated as well as adoption of a method of depreciation 
we have historically calculated depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets 
we have historically estimated the useful lives of our machinery and equipment to be three to five years  with the substantial majority of our packaging assets having estimated useful lives of four years 
effective with the fourth quarter of  we changed the estimated useful lives of certain of our packaging equipment from four years to seven years for depreciation purposes  which is in line with our historical usage and consistent with other companies in our industry 
we did not extend the useful lives of the packaging equipment associated with the second quarter impairment charge based on our expected use of that equipment and the associated cash flows 
this change reduced depreciation expense by approximately million per quarter 
our decision to change the estimated useful lives of such packaging equipment was based on the following historical experience  expected future cash flows  prevailing industry practice  consultations with an independent appraisal firm  and consultations with equipment manufacturers 
we believe that our principal competitors depreciate their packaging assets over periods of six to eight years 
the change of the estimated useful lives is considered a change in estimate and was accounted for prospectively beginning with the fourth quarter of evaluation of equity investments 
we evaluate our investments for impairment due to declines in market value that are considered other than temporary 
in the event of a determination that a decline in market value is other than temporary  a charge to earnings is recorded for the unrealized loss  and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
the stock prices of semiconductor companies stocks  including asi and its competitors  have experienced significant volatility during the past several years 
the weakness in the semiconductor industry has affected the demand for the wafer output from asi s foundry and the market value of asi s stock as traded on the korea stock exchange 
during  we recorded impairment charges totaling million to reduce the carrying value of our investment in asi to asi s market value 
additionally during  we recorded a loss of million on the disposition of a portion of our interest in asi to dongbu 
at january  amkor owned million shares or of asi s voting stock 
during  we divested million shares of asi stock and at december  amkor owned million shares of asi or 
on march   we sold an additional million shares of asi common stock to an investment bank for billion korean won million based on the spot exchange rate as of the transaction date which approximates the carrying value of those shares 
as part of that sale  we purchased a nondeliverable call option for million that expires december and is indexed to asi s share price with a strike price of per share 
the net proceeds from the exercise of the option could be less than the current carrying value and could expire unexercised losing our entire investment in the option 
as of march   we owned million shares of asi  or of asi s voting stock 
beginning march   we ceased accounting for our investment in asi under the equity method of accounting and commenced accounting for our investment as a marketable security that is available for sale 
we intend to sell our remaining investment in asi 
the ultimate level of proceeds from the sale of our remaining investment in asi could be less than the current carrying value 
valuation of inventory 
in general we order raw materials based on customers forecasted demand and we do not maintain any finished goods inventory 
if our customers change their forecasted requirements and we are unable to cancel our raw materials order or if our vendors require that we order a minimum quantity that exceeds the current forecasted demand  we will experience a build up in raw material inventory 
we will either seek to recover the cost of the materials from our customers or utilize the inventory in production 
however  we may not be successful in recovering the cost from our customers or be able to use the inventory in production and accordingly if we believe that it is probable that we will not be able to recover such costs we adjust our reserve estimate 
additionally  our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is based on forecasted demand we receive from our customers 
when a determination is made that the inventory will not be utilized in production it is written off and disposed 
market risk sensitivity our company is exposed to market risks  primarily related to foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risks our company s primary exposures to foreign currency fluctuations are associated with transactions and related assets and liabilities denominated in philippine pesos  korean won  japanese yen  taiwanese dollar and chinese yuan 
the objective in managing these foreign currency exposures is to minimize the risk through minimizing the level of activity and financial instruments denominated in those currencies 
our use of derivative instruments including forward exchange contracts has been insignificant throughout and and it is expected our use of derivative instruments will continue to be minimal 
the peso based financial instruments primarily consist of cash  non trade receivables  deferred tax assets and liabilities  non trade payables  accrued payroll  taxes and other expenses 
based on the portfolio of peso based assets and liabilities at december  and  a increase in the philippine peso to us dollar spot exchange rate as of the balance sheet dates would result in a decrease of approximately million and million  respectively  in peso based net assets 
the won based financial instruments primarily consist of cash  non trade receivables  non trade payables  accrued payroll  taxes and other expenses 
based on the portfolio of won based assets and liabilities at december  and  a increase in the korean won to us dollar spot exchange rate as of the balance sheet dates would result in a decrease of approximately million and million  respectively  in won based net assets 
the taiwanese dollar based financial instruments primarily consist of cash  non trade receivables  deferred tax assets and liabilities  non trade payables  accrued payroll  taxes  debt and other expenses 
based on the portfolio of taiwanese dollar based assets and liabilities at december  and  a increase in the taiwanese dollar to us dollar spot exchange rate as of the balance sheet dates would result in a decrease of approximately million and million  respectively  in taiwanese dollar based net assets 
the yuan based financial instruments primarily consist of cash  non trade receivables  deferred tax assets and liabilities  non trade payables  accrued payroll  taxes and other expenses 
based on the portfolio of yuan based assets and liabilities at december  and  a increase in the chinese yuan to us dollar spot exchange rate as of the balance sheet dates would result in a decrease of approximately million and million  respectively  in yuan based net assets 
the yen based financial instruments primarily consist of cash  non trade receivables  deferred tax assets and liabilities  non trade payables  accrued payroll  taxes  debt and other expenses 
our exposure to the yen is principally as a result of our acquisition of amkor iwate corporation and our acquisition of a semiconductor packaging business of citizen watch co  ltd 
based on the portfolio of yen based assets and liabilities at december  and  a decrease in the japanese yen to us dollar spot exchange rate as of the balance sheet date would result in an increase of approximately million and million  respectively  in yen based net liabilities 
interest rate risks our company has interest rate risk with respect to our long term debt 
as of december   we had a total of  million of debt of which was fixed rate debt and was variable rate debt 
our variable rate debt principally consisted of short term borrowings and amounts outstanding under our secured bank facilities that included term loans and a million revolving line of credit of which no amounts were drawn as of december  the fixed rate debt consisted of senior notes  senior subordinated notes  convertible subordinated notes and foreign debt 
as of december   we had a total of  million of debt of which was fixed rate debt and was variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on our fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value of the instrument but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the fair value of the instrument 
the fair value of the convertible subordinated notes is also impacted by the market price of our common stock 
the table below presents the interest rates  maturities and fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt as of december  year ending december  thereafter total fair value long term debt fixed rate debt        average interest rate variable rate debt        average interest rate equity price risks our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due and convertible subordinated notes due are convertible into common stock at per share and per share  respectively 
we intend to repay our convertible subordinated notes upon maturity  unless converted 
if investors were to decide to convert their notes to common stock  our future earnings would benefit from a reduction in interest expense and our common stock outstanding would be increased 
if we paid a premium to induce such conversion  our earnings could include an additional charge 
risk factors that may affect future operating performance the following section discloses the known material risks facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
we cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur 
if they do  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
dependence on the highly cyclical semiconductor and electronic products industries we operate in volatile industries  and industry downturns harm our performance 
our business is tied to market conditions in the semiconductor industry  which is highly cyclical 
because our business is  and will continue to be  dependent on the requirements of semiconductor companies for subcontracted packaging and test services  any downturn in the semiconductor industry or any other industry that uses a significant number of semiconductor devices  such as the personal computer and telecommunication devices industries  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
although we experienced significant recovery in our company s core packaging services during  there continues to be significant uncertainty throughout the industry related to market demand which is hindering visibility throughout the supply chain 
that lack of visibility makes it difficult to forecast whether the recovery we are experiencing will be sustained 
if industry conditions do not continue to improve  we could continue to sustain significant losses which could materially impact our business including our liquidity 
fluctuations in operating results our operating results may vary significantly as a result of factors that we cannot control 
our operating results have varied significantly from period to period 
many factors could materially and adversely affect our revenues  gross profit and operating income  or lead to significant variability of quarterly or annual operating results 
these factors include  among others evolutions in the life cycles of our customers products  changes in our capacity utilization  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by end users of semiconductors  the short term nature of our customers commitments  timing and volume of orders relative to our production capacity  rescheduling and cancellation of large orders  erosion of packaging selling prices  changes in costs  availability and delivery times of raw materials and components and changes in costs and availability of labor  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in semiconductor package mix  timing of expenditures in anticipation of future orders  availability and cost of financing for expansion  ability to develop and implement new technologies on a timely basis  competitive factors  changes in effective tax rates  loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled workers  international political  economic or terrorist events  currency and interest rate fluctuations  environmental events  and intellectual property transactions and disputes 
declining average selling prices the semiconductor industry places downward pressure on the prices of our products 
prices for packaging and test services and wafer fabrication services have declined over time 
historically  we have been able to partially offset the effect of price declines by successfully developing and marketing new packages with higher prices  such as advanced leadframe and laminate packages  by negotiating lower prices with our material vendors  and by driving engineering and technological changes in our packaging and test processes which resulted in reduced manufacturing costs 
average selling prices for declined as compared to average selling prices in average selling prices for declined as compared to average selling prices in these declines in average selling prices significantly impacted our gross margins in and we expect that average selling prices for our packaging and test services will continue to decline in the future 
if our semiconductor package mix does not shift to new technologies with higher prices or we cannot reduce the cost of our packaging and test services to offset a decline in average selling prices  our future operating results will suffer 
high leverage and restrictive covenants our substantial indebtedness could materially restrict our operations and adversely affect our financial condition 
we now have  and for the foreseeable future will have  a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of december   total debt was  million 
we have a million revolving line of credit of which no amounts were drawn as of december  in addition  despite current debt levels  the terms of the indentures governing our indebtedness may limit our ability to increase our indebtedness  but they do not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring substantially more debt 
if new debt is added to our consolidated debt level  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
in june and september we amended our existing bank debt covenants to provide further flexibility with respect to capital expenditures  investment restrictions and other financial covenants measured in part by our liquidity and earnings 
as part of the september amendment  lenders under our senior secured credit facility agreed to extend the existing financial covenant framework through december  our senior secured debt encompasses a million term loan and the unused revolving line of credit 
the term loan maintained its scheduled amortization of million per quarter through september and then approximately million per quarter beginning in december through september the bank debt facility will revert to its original covenant structure in january in general  covenants in the agreements governing our existing debt  and debt we may incur in the future  may materially restrict our operations  including our ability to incur debt  pay dividends  make certain investments and payments and encumber or dispose of assets 
in addition  financial covenants contained in agreements relating to our existing and future debt could lead to a default in the event our results of operations do not meet our plans and we are unable to amend such financial covenants prior to default 
a default under one debt instrument may also trigger cross defaults under our other debt instruments 
an event of default under one or more of our debt instruments  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
our credit and debt ratings were lowered in august  and accordingly  it may be difficult for us to secure additional financing  if we need it  on satisfactory terms or at all 
our substantial indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  research and development and other general corporate requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service interest and principal payments on our debt  limit our flexibility to react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage to any of our competitors that have less debt  and limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds 
relationship with asi our financial performance can be adversely affected by asi s financial performance we historically marketed the output of fabricated semiconductor wafers provided by a wafer fabrication foundry owned and operated by anam semiconductor  inc asi 
we derived  and of our wafer fabrication services revenues for   and  respectively  from texas instruments pursuant to a manufacturing and purchase agreement between our company  asi and texas instruments 
on february   we sold our wafer fabrication services business to asi 
additionally  we obtained a release from texas instruments regarding our contractual obligations with respect to wafer fabrication services to be performed subsequent to the transfer of the business to asi 
beginning with the first quarter of  we will reflect our wafer fabrication services segment as a discontinued operation and restate our historical results 
in connection with the disposition of our wafer fabrication business  we expect to incur an estimated million in severance and other exit costs to close our wafer fabrication services operations in boise  idaho and lyon  france 
we estimate that in the first quarter of we will recognize a pre tax net gain on the disposition of our wafer fabrication services business approximately million 
the carrying value of the disposed net assets associated with the business as of february  was million 
in addition  pursuant to the agreements between amkor and dongbu  amkor and dongbu agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause dongbu electronics and asi to be merged together as soon as practicable  amkor and dongbu agreed to cause asi to use the proceeds asi received from its sale of stock to dongbu to purchase shares in dongbu electronics and amkor and dongbu agreed to use their best efforts to provide releases and indemnifications to the chairman  directors and officers of asi  either past or incumbent  from any and all liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties at asi between january  and december  the last provision would provide a release and indemnification for james kim  our ceo and chairman  and members of his family 
we are not aware of any claims or other liabilities which these individuals would be released from or for which they would receive indemnification 
at january  amkor owned million shares or of asi s voting stock 
during  we divested million shares of asi stock and at december  amkor owned million shares of asi or 
on march   we sold an additional million shares of asi common stock to an investment bank for billion korean won million based on the spot exchange rate as of the transaction date which approximates the carrying value of those shares 
as part of that sale  we purchased a nondeliverable call option for million that expires december and is indexed to asi s share price with a strike price of per share 
the net proceeds from the exercise of the option could be less than the current carrying value and could expire unexercised losing our entire investment in the option 
as of march   we owned million shares of asi  or of asi s voting stock 
beginning march   we ceased accounting for our investment in asi under the equity method of accounting and commenced accounting for our investment as a marketable security that is available for sale 
we intend to sell our remaining investment in asi 
the ultimate level of proceeds from the sale of our remaining investment in asi could be less than the current carrying value 
absence of backlog we may not be able to adjust costs quickly if our customers demand falls suddenly 
our packaging and test business does not typically operate with any material backlog 
we expect that in the future our quarterly net revenues from packaging and test will continue to be substantially dependent upon our customers demand in that quarter 
none of our customers have committed to purchase any significant amount of packaging or test services or to provide us with binding forecasts of demand for packaging and test services for any future period 
in addition  our customers could reduce  cancel or delay their purchases of packaging and test services 
because a large portion of our costs is fixed and our expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future revenues  we may be unable to adjust costs in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall 
risks associated with international operations we depend on our factories in the philippines  korea  japan  taiwan and china 
many of our customers and vendors operations are also located outside of the us we provide packaging and test services through our factories located in the philippines  korea  japan  taiwan and china 
moreover  many of our customers and vendors operations are located outside the us the following are some of the risks inherent in doing business internationally regulatory limitations imposed by foreign governments  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  political  military and terrorist risks  disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs brokers or government agencies  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences resulting from changes in tax laws 
difficulties integrating acquisitions we face challenges as we integrate new and diverse operations and try to attract qualified employees to support our geographic expansion 
as a result of our geographic expansion we have experienced  and may continue to experience  growth in the scope and complexity of our operations 
this growth has strained our managerial  financial  manufacturing and other resources 
future acquisitions and expansions may result in inefficiencies as we integrate new operations and manage geographically diverse operations 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key senior management and technical personnel  any of whom would be difficult to replace 
competition for qualified employees is intense  and our business could be adversely affected by the loss of the services of any of our existing key personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in hiring and properly training sufficient numbers of qualified personnel and in effectively managing our growth 
our inability to attract  retain  motivate and train qualified new personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
dependence on materials and equipment suppliers our business may suffer if the cost or supply of materials or equipment changes adversely 
we obtain from various vendors the materials and equipment required for the packaging and test services performed by our factories 
we source most of our materials  including critical materials such as leadframes and laminate substrates  from a limited group of suppliers 
furthermore  we purchase all of our materials on a purchase order basis and have no long term contracts with any of our suppliers 
our business may be harmed if we cannot obtain materials and other supplies from our vendors in a timely manner  in sufficient quantities  in acceptable quality or at competitive prices 
rapid technological change our business will suffer if we cannot keep up with technological advances in our industry 
the complexity and breadth of semiconductor packaging and test services are rapidly changing 
as a result  we expect that we will need to offer more advanced package designs in order to respond to competitive industry conditions and customer requirements 
our success depends upon the ability of our company to develop and implement new manufacturing processes and package design technologies 
the need to develop and maintain advanced packaging capabilities and equipment could require significant research and development and capital expenditures in future years 
in addition  converting to new package designs or process methodologies could result in delays in producing new package types that could adversely affect our ability to meet customer orders 
technological advances also typically lead to rapid and significant price erosion and may make our existing products less competitive or our existing inventories obsolete 
if we cannot achieve advances in package design or obtain access to advanced package designs developed by others  our business could suffer 
competition we compete against established competitors in the packaging and test business 
the subcontracted semiconductor packaging and test market is very competitive 
we face substantial competition from established packaging and test service providers primarily located in asia  including companies with significant manufacturing capacity  financial resources  research and development operations  marketing and other capabilities 
these companies also have established relationships with many large semiconductor companies that are current or potential customers of our company 
on a larger scale  we also compete with the internal semiconductor packaging and test capabilities of many of our customers 
environmental regulations future environmental regulations could place additional burdens on our manufacturing operations 
the semiconductor packaging process uses chemicals and gases and generates byproducts that are subject to extensive governmental regulations 
for example  at our foreign manufacturing facilities  we produce liquid waste when silicon wafers are diced into chips with the aid of diamond saws  then cooled with running water 
federal  state and local regulations in the united states  as well as international environmental regulations  impose various controls on the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of chemicals used in our manufacturing processes and on the factories we occupy 
increasingly  public attention has focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing operations and the risk to neighbors of chemical releases from such operations 
in the future  applicable land use and environmental regulations may impose upon us the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements  restrict our ability to expand our operations  subject us to liability or cause us to curtail our operations 
protection of intellectual property we may become involved in intellectual property litigation 
as of march   we held us patents and had pending patents 
in addition to the us patents  we held patents in foreign jurisdictions 
we expect to continue to file patent applications when appropriate to protect our proprietary technologies  but we cannot assure you that we will receive patents from pending or future applications 
in addition  any patents we obtain may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented and may not provide meaningful protection or other commercial advantage to us 
we may need to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend our company against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation  which could result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if any third party makes a valid claim against us  we could be required to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use  import and sale of infringing products  pay substantial damages  develop non infringing technologies  or acquire licenses to the technology we had allegedly infringed 
if we fail to obtain necessary licenses or if we face litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters  our business could suffer 
continued control by existing stockholders mr 
james kim and members of his family can substantially control the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of february   mr 
james kim and members of his family beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
mr 
james kim s family  acting together  will substantially control all matters submitted for approval by our stockholders 
these matters could include the election of all of the members of our board of directors  proxy contests  mergers involving our company  tender offers  and open market purchase programs or other purchases of our common stock 
stock price volatility the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as actual or anticipated quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products and services by amkor or our competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor industry  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts  and other events or factors  many of which are out of our control 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the markets for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has affected the market prices of securities of companies like ours for reasons that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to such companies operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock
