item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview scotts is a leading manufacturer and marketer of consumer branded products for lawn and garden care and professional horticulture in north america and europe 
we also have a presence in australia  the far east  latin america and south america 
also  in the united states  we operate the second largest residential lawn service business  scotts lawnservice r 
in fiscal  our operations were divided into four business segments north american consumer  scotts lawnservice r  global professional  and international consumer 
the north american consumer segment includes the lawns  gardening products  ortho r and canadian business groups 
we are also monsanto s exclusive agent for the marketing and distribution of consumer roundup r non selective herbicide within the united states and other contractually specified countries 
in fiscal  we continued the rapid expansion of our scotts lawnservice r business 
through acquisitions and internal growth  revenues increased from approximately million in fiscal to over million in fiscal we completed million of lawn care acquisitions in fiscal and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions in fiscal and beyond  although at a somewhat slower pace 
as a leading consumer branded lawn and garden company  we focus our consumer marketing efforts  including advertising and consumer research  on creating consumer demand to pull products through the retail distribution channels 
in the past three years  we have spent approximately of our net sales annually on media advertising to support and promote our products and brands 
we have applied this consumer marketing focus for the past several years  and we believe that scotts receives a significant return on these marketing expenditures 
we expect that we will continue to focus our marketing efforts toward the consumer and make additional significant investments in consumer marketing expenditures in the future to continue to drive market share and sales growth 
in fiscal  we expect to increase advertising spending as we deliver a new media message for the ortho r line  increase our advertising spending on selected brands in europe and continue to have the largest share of voice in our lawn and garden categories in north america 
our sales are susceptible to global weather conditions  primarily in north america and europe 
for instance  periods of wet weather like we experienced this past spring in the united states adversely impacted fertilizer sales but increased demand for certain pesticide products 
we believe that our past acquisitions have somewhat diversified both our product line risk and geographic risk to weather conditions 
historically  the majority of our shipments to retailers have occurred in the second and third fiscal quarters 
however  over the past two years  retailers have reduced their pre season inventories by relying on vendors to deliver products in season when consumers seek to buy our products 
this change in retailer purchasing patterns and the increasing importance of scotts lawnservice r revenues  has caused a sales shift from our second fiscal quarter to the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
net sales by quarter were    and  respectively  of fiscal net sales 
concurrent with this sales shift  and because of the expansion of scotts lawnservice r  the company has experienced a shift in profitability from the second to third and fourth fiscal quarters  with the third fiscal quarter now more profitable than the second fiscal quarter 
results for the company s fourth fiscal quarter  historically a loss making quarter  improved substantially in fiscal we expect the trend towards stronger third and fourth fiscal quarter sales and profits to continue in fiscal beginning in fiscal  the company began expensing prospective grants of employee stock based compensation awards in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 

the fair value of future awards will be expensed ratably over the vesting period  which has historically been three years  except for grants to directors  which have a six month vesting period 
the related compensation expense recorded in fiscal was million 
in fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard eliminates the requirement to amortize indefinite lived assets and goodwill 
it also requires an initial impairment test on all indefinite lived assets as of the date of adoption of this standard and impairment tests done at least annually thereafter 
as a result of adopting the standard as of october   amortization expense for fiscal and was reduced by approximately million in each year 
we completed our impairment analysis in the second quarter of fiscal  taking into account additional guidance provided by eitf  unit of measure for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 
as a result  a pre tax impairment charge related to the value of tradenames in our german  french and united kingdom consumer businesses of million was recorded as of october  after income taxes  the net charge was million which is recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
there was no goodwill impairment as of the date of adoption 
upon completing the annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of fiscal  it was determined that a charge for impairment was not required 
in fiscal  we announced the international profit improvement plan to improve the operations and profitability of our european based consumer and professional businesses 
by the end of  we anticipate spending between million and million in the aggregate on various projects related to this plan  approximately of which will be capital expenditures 
approximately of the total spending relates to the reorganization and rationalization of our european supply chain  increased sales force productivity and a shift to pan european category management of our product portfolio 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced the closure of a manufacturing plant in bramford  england 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  million of severance and additional pension costs related to the closure were recorded and reported as restructuring and other charges 
the closure was completed in may with the transfer of united kingdom fertilizer production to our howden  united kingdom facility 
for further information concerning the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal years  and  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  scotts adopted accounting policies that required certain amounts payable to customers or consumers related to the purchase of our products to be recorded as a reduction in net sales rather than as advertising and promotion expense eg  volume rebates and coupons 
in fiscal  scotts adopted eitf  accounting for consideration from a vendor to a retailer in connection with the purchase or promotion of the vendor s products 
this standard requires scotts to record certain of its cooperative advertising expenditures as reductions of net sales rather than as advertising and promotion expense 
results for prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform to this new presentation method for these expenses 
in fiscal  restructuring and other charges of million were recorded for reductions in work force  facility closures  asset writedowns  and other related costs 
certain costs associated with this restructuring initiative  including costs related to the relocation of equipment  personnel and inventory  were not recorded as part of the restructuring costs in fiscal these costs  which totaled million  were recorded as they were incurred in fiscal as required under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included under item financial statements and supplementary data our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  environmental matters  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates that we believe are most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position are as follows we have significant investments in property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
whenever changing conditions warrant  we review the realizability of the assets that may be impacted 
at least annually  we review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the review for impairment of long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill takes into account estimates of future cash flows 
our estimates of future cash flows are based upon budgets and longer range plans 
these budgets and plans are used for internal purposes and are also the basis for communication with outside parties about future business trends 
while we believe the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized 
as a result  impairment charges that possibly should have been recognized in earlier periods may not be recognized until later periods if actual results deviate unfavorably from earlier estimates 
we continually assess the adequacy of our reserves for uncollectible accounts due from customers 
however  future changes in our customers operating performance and cash flows or in general economic conditions could have an impact on their ability to fully pay these amounts which could have a material impact on our operating results 
reserves for product returns are based upon historical data and current program terms and conditions with our customers 
changes in economic conditions  regulatory actions or defective products could result in actual returns being materially different than the amounts provided for in our interim or annual results of operations 
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are based on a variety of factors  including product changes and improvements  changes in active ingredient availability and regulatory acceptance  new product introductions and estimated future demand 
the adequacy of our reserves could be materially affected by changes in the demand for our products or regulatory actions 
as described more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended september   we are involved in significant environmental and legal matters which have a high degree of uncertainty associated with them 
we continually assess the likely outcomes of these matters and the adequacy of amounts  if any  provided for these matters 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcomes will not differ materially from our assessment of them 
there can also be no assurance that all matters that may be brought against us or that we may bring against other parties are known to us at any point in time 
we accrue for the estimated costs of customer volume rebates  cooperative advertising  consumer coupons and other trade programs as the related sales occur during the year 
these accruals involve the use of estimates as to the total expected program costs and the expected sales levels 
historical results are also used to evaluate the accuracy and adequacy of amounts provided at interim dates and year end 
there can be no assurance that actual amounts paid for these trade programs will not differ from estimated amounts accrued 
however  we believe any such differences would not be material to our financial position or results of operations 
we record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances are used to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
we must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine the proper valuation allowance 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflects the change in the period such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to this valuation allowance 
the company uses an estimate of its annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
also  as described more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we have not accrued the deferred contribution under the roundup r marketing agreement with monsanto or the per annum charges thereon 
we consider this method of accounting for the contribution payments to be appropriate after consideration of the likely term of the agreement  our ability to terminate the agreement without paying the deferred amounts  and the fact that approximately million of the deferred amount is never paid  even if the agreement is not terminated prior to  unless significant earnings targets are exceeded 
at september   contribution payments and related per annum charges of approximately million had been deferred under the agreement 
new accounting standards not yet effective the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin  in january this interpretation explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
the company will be required to adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of fiscal the company is still evaluating the provisions of fin and its related fasb staff positions for applicability to the company s scotts lawnservice r franchises are currently being reviewed for application of this interpretation 
the company has no other special purpose entities that would be applicable under this interpretation 
results of operations the following table sets forth the components of income and expense as a percentage of net sales for the three years ended september  net sales cost of sales restructuring and other charges gross profit commission earned from marketing agreement  net advertising selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative lawn service business restructuring and other charges amortization of goodwill and other intangibles other income  net income from operations interest expense income before income taxes income taxes income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of change in accounting for intangible assets  net of tax net income the following table sets forth net sales by business segment for the three years ended september  millions north american consumer lawns gardening products ortho r canada other total    scotts lawnservice r international consumer global professional consolidated    fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal increased to  million from  million in fiscal north american consumer segment net sales were  million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from net sales for fiscal of  million 
within the north american consumer segment  lawns net sales in fiscal increased a robust due to strong acceptance of the new miracle gro r lawn fertilizer line at wal mart and continued strong sales of turf builder r lawn fertilizer  control products and grass seed 
gardening products sales  which include growing media and garden fertilizers  were essentially flat year over year with higher sales of value added miracle gro r potting mix and garden soils mainly offset by lower sales of commodity growing media products 
ortho r s net sales increased in fiscal  driven largely by strong sales of selective and non selective weed control products and continued growth of the ortho r home defense r indoor and perimeter pest control product line  partially offset by lower outdoor insect control sales 
several important outdoor insect control products are scheduled for re launch with increased advertising support in fiscal scotts lawnservice r net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the growth in net sales has been largely fueled by geographic expansion and acquisitions 
spending on acquisitions  including seller financing  reached million in fiscal versus million in fiscal fiscal was impacted by a major acquisition late in the year  representing nearly one half of fiscal acquisition spending and favorably impacting fiscal net sales 
net sales for the international consumer segment were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal excluding the effects of currency fluctuations and non recurring sales from previous supply agreements  net sales increased approximately million  or  in fiscal sales increased in all major countries except germany which experienced lower sales due to increased regulatory restrictions and product line gaps that are being addressed in fiscal net sales for the global professional segment reached million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal excluding the effects of currency fluctuations  sales were essentially flat but reflected a shift to more profitable controlled release fertilizer sales due to management s decision to exit certain lower margin growing media businesses 
selling price changes were not material to net sales in fiscal or fiscal gross profit increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal favorable impacts were realized from certain supply chain initiatives and higher volume 
these benefits were offset by unfavorable warehousing and material handling costs and product mix  particularly in our lawns business  which was also impacted by higher urea costs 
lastly  restructuring and other expenses  included in cost of sales  primarily related to international supply chain initiatives  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reducing gross profit as a percentage of net sales by basis points 
the net commission earned from the roundup r marketing agreement in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the increase from the prior year is primarily due to strong underlying growth in roundup r sales  which drove the gross commission higher  partially offset by a million increase in the contribution payment due to monsanto  which increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal advertising expenses in fiscal were million  an increase of million from fiscal the increase in advertising expenses is primarily due to the re launch of television media support for the ortho r line and media support for new product launches such as miracle gro r shake n feed r 
foreign currency fluctuations also increased reported advertising expenses by million 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal excluding the expensing of stock based compensation  infrastructure investment in the scotts lawnservice r and restructuring and other charges  the company s sg a expenses increased million  or  compared to this increase is primarily due to investments to support our expansion into adjacent categories and channels  investments to expand the functionality and capability of our business development offices at our largest retailers  and foreign exchange fluctuations 
sg a expenses for scotts lawnservice r increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to growth in the branch service network  supporting our plan to rapidly expand to a national platform 
sg a restructuring and other expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily related to the implementation of the international profit improvement plan 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations and higher expenses related to the amortization of certain intangibles  primarily related to customer lists acquired by scotts lawnservice r 
other income  net was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the company realized a net reduction of approximately million from an agreement to cease peat extraction in the united kingdom 
increased scotts lawnservice r franchise fees and royalty income recorded in fiscal partially off set the reduction related to peat extraction 
income from operations in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal this decrease in income from operations reflects higher net sales and gross profit  offset by greater investments in media advertising and higher sg a expenses  higher restructuring spending in europe to support our international profit improvement plan and the adoption of an accounting change to expense stock based compensation awards 
for segment reporting purposes  earnings before interest  taxes and amortization is used as the measure for income from operations operating income 
on that basis  operating income in the north american consumer segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  on an increase in net sales from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal higher sales volume primarily in the lawns business and favorable volume related manufacturing cost absorption were largely offset by a decrease in gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales due to product mix and increased urea and warehousing costs  and higher media and sg a expenses 
scotts lawnservice s r operating income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to planned infrastructure investments and higher field labor and truck costs  largely the result of poor spring weather that delayed the start of the spring treatment season 
these higher costs more than offset increased margin resulting from higher net sales  which were driven by geographic expansion and acquisitions 
international consumer s operating income was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal operating income is largely due to planned restructuring expenses  as outlined in the company s international profit improvement plan  and a non recurring peat transaction gain recognized in fiscal foreign currency fluctuations also favorably impacted operating income 
global professional s operating income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to higher gross profit margins  largely driven by stringent cost controls and management s decision to exit low margin commodity growing media 
foreign currency fluctuations also favorably impacted operating income 
interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to debt repayments and strong operating cash flow  which resulted in lower average borrowing levels as compared to the prior year  and lower interest rates on our credit revolver and variable rate term loans 
the weighted average cost of debt was in fiscal compared to in fiscal income tax expense for fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal this decrease in income tax expense as compared to the prior year primarily was the result of a reduction in the company s effective tax rate from in to in  due to an adjustment of state deferred income taxes resulting from a detailed review of state effective tax rates  and increased utilization of foreign tax credits in fiscal the company reported income before cumulative effect of accounting changes of million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal after the charge of million million  net of tax for the impairment of trade names in our german  french and united kingdom businesses  net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal average diluted shares outstanding increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to option and warrant exercises and the impact on common stock equivalents of a higher average share price in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal increased to  million from  million in fiscal north american consumer segment net sales were  million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from net sales for fiscal of  million 
within the north american consumer segment  lawns net sales increased in fiscal over due to strong acceptance of our new summerguard r product and continued strong sales of turf builder r lawn fertilizer  control products and grass seed  gardening products net sales increased over due to continued strong performance of our value added line of miracle gro r potting mix and garden soil with an off setting decline of in our garden fertilizers due primarily to a colder and wetter may the business peak sales month in the midwest and eastern portions of the united states 
ortho r net sales were down slightly in fiscal despite an increase in consumer purchases of certain product lines  overall ortho r net sales declined slightly in fiscal as we reduced national television advertising support to reassess our campaign for this line and prepared for a new campaign in fiscal scotts lawnservice r net sales increased over from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the growth in net sales reflects the growth in the business from the acquisitions completed in fiscal  new branch openings in late winter of and the growth in customers from our spring and fall marketing campaigns 
spending on acquisitions  including seller financing  increased from nearly million in fiscal to over million in fiscal due to one major acquisition  nearly one half of fiscal s acquisition spending occurred in august resulting in only a minor contribution to fiscal s revenue growth 
net sales for the international consumer segment were million in fiscal  which were million  or  lower than net sales for fiscal excluding the effects of currency fluctuations  net sales declined over million from fiscal to fiscal efforts by retailers to reduce their inventory investment and more closely time their purchases to consumer purchases contributed to the year over year sales decrease 
net sales for the global professional segment were million in fiscal  which were million  or  lower than net sales for fiscal the decline was primarily in north america where our customers  the end user growers  have been impacted by retailer initiatives to reduce inventory levels 
selling price changes were not material to net sales in fiscal or fiscal gross profit increased million in fiscal from fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal in north america  cost savings from our supply chain and purchasing initiatives to reduce manufacturing costs were partially offset by lower absorption of fixed costs due to lower production levels 
production levels were lowered in order to reduce north american inventory levels  which declined over million from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal other factors affecting margins were better product mix  particularly in our lawns and gardening products businesses  and the increasing contribution of our rapidly growing scotts lawnservice r business which has higher margins than our other business units 
lastly  restructuring expenses included in cost of sales declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal which improved gross profit as a percentage of net sales by basis points 
the net commission earned from the roundup r marketing agreement in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal the decrease from the prior year is primarily due to a million increase in the contribution payment due to monsanto to million in fiscal from million in fiscal advertising expenses in fiscal were million  a decrease of million from advertising expenses in fiscal of million 
the decrease in advertising expenses from the prior year is primarily due to efficiencies from improved media buying and lower rates and reduced media spending on the ortho r line which was replaced with more in store promotional support  which is a marketing expense included in sg a expenses 
sg a expenses in fiscal were million  compared to million for fiscal the reduction is primarily due to restructuring and other charges of million in fiscal compared to only million in fiscal excluding restructuring expenses in both fiscal years  the million environmental charge in fiscal and sg a expenses of the scotts lawnservice r business from both fiscal and results  sg a expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to million  or  of net sales in fiscal which reflects the benefits in fiscal from the cost reduction efforts undertaken in through reduction in workforce and other restructuring activities even though other costs such as litigation related legal expenses and information systems support expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal fiscal includes million of restructuring charges in costs of sales related to the redeployment of inventory from closed plants and warehouses and million in sg a expenses related to the relocation of personnel for the restructuring activities initiated in fiscal under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  these costs have been expensed in the period incurred 
also  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  approximately million in restructuring charges  primarily severance and pension costs  related to the announced closure of a plant in bramford  england were recorded 
in fiscal  million of restructuring and other charges were recorded in cost of sales and million in sg a costs 
amortization of goodwill and intangibles in fiscal declined to million from million in fiscal  primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal other income was million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to the gain and other income from the agreement for the cessation of peat extraction in the united kingdom of approximately million 
this gain was partially offset by lower royalty income due to the phase out in of a lawn mower program at a major north american retailer and a one time insurance settlement gain in fiscal income from operations for fiscal was million  compared with million for fiscal the increase in income from operations over the prior year is the result of lower restructuring expenses  increased gross margin from the increase in net sales  lower advertising spending  lower sg a expenses  and the effect of the change in accounting for amortization of indefinite lived assets 
operating income in the north american consumer segment increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal on an increase in net sales from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal gross margin improvement from supply chain cost reductions  improved product sales mix in lawns and gardening products  and reduced media spending levels were partially offset by lower overhead absorption due to reduced production levels  a reduction in the roundup r commission and decreased licensing royalties 
scotts lawnservice s r operating income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the over increase in net sales driven by internal growth and acquisitions 
international consumer operating income was million for fiscal  compared to a loss of million for fiscal even though net sales declined to million from million during the periods 
operating income increased due to the peat transaction with english nature  lower spending on sg a  and lower restructuring charges which declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal global professional operating income increased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal despite a slight reduction in net sales due to cost controls implemented in fiscal interest expense for fiscal was million  a decrease of million from interest expense for fiscal of million 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a reduction in average borrowings as compared to the prior year due to increased profitability and lower working capital  and lower interest rates on our debt 
the weighted average cost of debt was in fiscal compared to in fiscal income tax expense for fiscal was million  compared with income tax expense for fiscal of million 
the increase in income tax expense from the prior year is the result of higher pre tax income in fiscal for the reasons noted above 
the lower estimated income tax rate for fiscal of compared to for fiscal is primarily due to effect of the elimination of amortization expense for book purposes that was not deductible for tax purposes and higher earnings in fiscal the company reported income before cumulative effect of accounting changes of million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal after the charge of million million  net of tax for the impairment of tradenames in our german  french and united kingdom businesses  net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or 
per diluted share  in fiscal if sfas no 
had been adopted as of the beginning of fiscal diluted earnings per share for fiscal would have been excluding impairment charges  if any  that would have been recorded upon adoption at october  diluted earnings per share in fiscal would have been per share if the impairment charge was excluded 
average diluted shares outstanding increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to option and warrant exercises  and the impact on common stock equivalents of a higher average share price in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal following a record year for cash flow generation in fiscal  cash flow provided by operating activities was again very strong in fiscal due principally to increased profitability  lower cash expenditures for restructuring and a reduction in taxes paid due to a change in the tax treatment of trade programs from a cash to accrual basis 
cash flow from operating activities in fiscal benefited from a million one time reduction in domestic inventory levels from unusually high levels at the end of fiscal the seasonal nature of our operations generally requires cash to fund significant increases in working capital primarily inventory during the first half of the year 
receivables and payables also build substantially in the second quarter in line with increasing sales as the season begins 
these balances liquidate during the june through september period as the lawn and garden season winds down 
as of the end of fiscal  accounts receivable increased by million  in line with reported fourth quarter net sales growth 
net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal were million compared to million in the fourth fiscal quarter of inventories increased million in fiscal as compared to a million reduction in fiscal as discussed above 
accounts payable increased million in fiscal due principally to global cash management initiatives and to foreign currency fluctuations  which increased reported payables by approximately million 
the funded status of our pension plan decreased slightly in fiscal with improved investment performance being essentially offset by higher benefit obligations  due to the effect of a basis point decline in the interest rates used to discount future benefit obligations  and the impact of foreign currency translation on our international benefits plans 
the unfunded status of our curtailed defined benefit plans in the united states increased slightly from a deficit of million at september  to a deficit of million at september  our international plans went from a deficit of million in fiscal to a deficit of million in fiscal employer contributions to the plans in fiscal are not expected to increase appreciably from fiscal contributions of million 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  roughly comparable to million in the prior year 
payments on seller notes increased because of required payments made on scotts lawnservice r deferred purchase obligations in fiscal cash payments on acquisitions decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal cash payments related to scotts lawnservice r acquisitions were million in fiscal the total value of acquisitions by scotts lawnservice r  including property and equipment obtained in the acquisitions  in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal financing activities used cash of million in fiscal  compared to a cash usage of million the prior year 
the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to mandatory repayments of borrowings on our term loans in fiscal proceeds from the exercises of stock options increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in addition to option exercises in fiscal  million warrants were exercised by hagedorn partnership  lp in exchange for the issuance of million shares in a series of non cash transactions 
our primary sources of liquidity are funds generated by operations and borrowings under our credit agreement 
the credit agreement provided for borrowings in the aggregate principal amount of billion consisting of term loan facilities in the aggregate amount of million and a revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
due to paydowns on our term loans  the amount remaining under the term loan facilities had been reduced to approximately million as of september  also  as of september   approximately million of the million revolving credit facility was committed for letters of credit  the balance of approximately million is available for use 
total debt was million as of september   a decrease of million compared to total debt at september  of million 
the decrease in debt compared to the prior year was primarily due to scheduled debt repayments on our term loans during fiscal and payments made on scotts lawnservice r seller notes 
there were no borrowings on our revolver as of september  or september  due to significantly improved cash flows from operating activities in both years 
at september   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
the credit agreement contains covenants on interest coverage and leverage 
the credit agreement and the senior subordinated note indenture agreement also contain numerous negative covenants which we were also in compliance with in fiscal there are no rating triggers in our credit agreement or the subordinated note indenture agreement 
in october  the scotts company completed a refinancing of its credit agreement and its million senior subordinated notes in a series of transactions 
the new credit agreement was entered into with a syndicate of commercial banks and institutional lenders 
the new credit agreement consists of a million multi currency revolving credit commitment  expiring on october   and a million term loan b facility  expiring on september  repayment of the term loan b commences on march   with minimum quarterly principal payments through june   followed by a balloon maturity on september  also  as part of the refinancing  million of senior subordinated notes due october were issued at par  with interest payable semi annually on may and november total cash was million at september   an increase of million from september  due to restrictions in our debt agreements on voluntary prepayments of indebtedness  we elected not to use the cash on hand at september  to paydown indebtedness because voluntary paydowns permanently reduce the total borrowing commitment available under the credit facility 
a mandatory excess cash flow prepayment of million was made in early fiscal based upon fiscal s results of operations and cash flows 
our year end cash effectively serves to reduce our average indebtedness by reducing borrowings under the revolving credit facility to fund our seasonal working capital needs 
we did not repurchase any treasury shares in fiscal or fiscal we have not paid dividends on the common shares in the past and do not presently plan to pay dividends on the common shares 
it is presently anticipated that earnings will be retained and reinvested to support the growth of our business or to pay down indebtedness 
the payment of future dividends  if any  on common shares will be determined by the board of directors of scotts in light of conditions then existing  including our earnings  financial condition and capital requirements  restrictions in financing agreements  business conditions and other factors 
all of our off balance sheet financing is in the form of operating leases which are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of september   we had million of outstanding guarantees  primarily related to deferred purchase obligations on scotts lawnservice r acquisitions 
all material intercompany transactions are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
certain transactions with executive officers are fully described and disclosed in our proxy statement 
such transactions pertain primarily to office space provided to and administrative services provided by hagedorn partnership  lp and do not exceed  per annum 
in july  the scotts company s board of directors approved the international profit improvement plan designed to significantly improve the profitability of the international consumer and professional businesses 
the plan includes implementation of an sap platform throughout europe  as well as efforts to optimize operations in the united kingdom  france and germany  including the creation of a global supply chain 
we now estimate that cash outlays of between million and million will be required by the end of fiscal  of which approximately will be capital expenditures  and approximately will be recorded as expenses to implement this plan 
for further information concerning the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal years  and  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are party to various pending judicial and administrative proceedings  including those discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these include  among others  proceedings based on accidents or product liability claims and alleged violations of environmental laws 
we have reviewed our pending environmental and legal proceedings  including the probable outcomes  reasonably anticipated costs and expenses  availability and limits of our insurance coverage and have established what we believe to be appropriate reserves 
we do not believe that any liabilities that may result from these proceedings are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
the following table summarizes our future cash outflows for contractual obligations as of september  in millions payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations fixed interest payments annual contribution payment under year term of marketing agreement total contractual cash obligations  in our opinion  cash flows from operating activities and capital resources will be sufficient to meet debt service and working capital needs during fiscal  and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot ensure that our business groups will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facilities in amounts sufficient to pay indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs 
actual results of operations will depend on numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
environmental matters we are subject to local  state  federal and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and believe we are operating in substantial compliance with  or taking actions aimed at ensuring compliance with  such laws and regulations 
we are involved in several legal actions with various governmental agencies related to environmental matters 
while it is difficult to quantify the potential financial impact of actions involving environmental matters  particularly remediation costs at waste disposal sites and future capital expenditures for environmental control equipment  in the opinion of management  the ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters  taking into account established reserves  should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
however  there can be no assurance that the resolution of these matters will not materially affect future quarterly or annual results of operations  financial condition or cash flows of the company 
additional information on environmental matters affecting us is provided in item business environmental and regulatory considerations  item business regulatory actions and item legal proceedings 
management s outlook we are very pleased with the company s performance in fiscal despite generally cool and wet spring weather conditions that delayed the start of the lawn and garden season  and planned savings from the outsourcing of transportation and logistics management that were not achieved  the company reported record net sales and earnings in fiscal we set several challenging goals for fiscal  including aggressive sales growth and share gains within our core north american consumer lawn and garden categories  continued rapid expansion of scotts lawnservice r and implementation of the international profit improvement plan 
we also set aggressive goals to improve customer service levels in our order processing and supply chain organizations by moving to real time consumer based replenishment of store inventory levels 
we were successful in strengthening our relationships with key accounts by focusing on improving in season execution and by driving more consumers to retailers stores to purchase lawn and garden products 
we also had a second consecutive year of strong cash flow generation due to our continuing focus on working capital management and capital expenditures 
while we continued the rapid expansion of scotts lawnservice r  the business fell considerably short of its aggressive sales and earnings growth targets 
poor spring weather  which delayed the start of the spring treatment season  was clearly a contributing factor 
however  the business also experienced customer service  infrastructure and business integration challenges  due to its rapid growth  that are a primary area of focus in the year ahead 
consequently  the pace of expansion will be slower in fiscal and we anticipate making selective  but fewer  acquisitions 
our strong results in fiscal set the stage for another successful year in fiscal we are committed to the continued improvement of our international consumer and global professional segments 
we are progressing on the international profit improvement plan  which is a three year plan to invest in systems and to reorganize our international operations to drive sustainable  profitable growth 
we anticipate continued strong execution from our global supply chain organization on several important purchasing  logistics and manufacturing initiatives 
we also plan to continue to invest aggressively in media advertising and in store merchandising and promotional initiatives to drive sales growth and profitability in fiscal our strategy is also to develop new distribution channels  and to leverage our strong brands to enter complementary adjacent product categories 
we believe fiscal will be another year of profitable growth  with continued focus on improving our return on invested capital and strong cash flow generation 
forward looking statements we have made and will make forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in our annual report  in this form k and in other contexts relating to future growth and profitability targets and strategies designed to increase total shareholder value 
forward looking statements also include  but are not limited to  information regarding our future economic and financial condition  the plans and objectives of our management and our assumptions regarding our performance and these plans and objectives 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information  so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of that act 
some forward looking statements that we make in our annual report  in this form k and in other contexts represent challenging goals for our company  and the achievement of these goals is subject to a variety of risks and assumptions and numerous factors beyond our control 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make are described below 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the following cautionary statements 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 
we have a significant amount of debt 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under outstanding indebtedness and otherwise  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operating activities to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the cash flows available to fund working capital  capital expenditures  advertising  research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  and expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or that future borrowings will be available to us under our second amended and restated credit agreement the new credit agreement in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
restrictive covenants may adversely affect us 
the new credit agreement and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes the new indenture contain restrictive covenants and cross default provisions that require us to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to satisfy those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy those ratios 
a breach of any of these financial ratio covenants or other covenants in the new credit agreement or the new indenture could result in a default under the new credit agreement and or the new indenture 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the new credit agreement and or the new indenture  the lenders and or noteholders could elect to declare the applicable outstanding indebtedness to be immediately due and payable and  in the case of our lenders under the new credit agreement  terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
we cannot be sure that our lenders or the noteholders would waive a default or that we could pay the indebtedness in full if it were accelerated 
adverse weather conditions could adversely impact financial results 
weather conditions in north america and europe have a significant impact on the timing of sales in the spring selling season and overall annual sales 
an abnormally cold spring throughout north america and or europe could adversely affect both fertilizer and pesticide sales and  therefore  our financial results 
our historical seasonality could impair our ability to pay obligations as they come due in addition to our operating expenses 
because our products are used primarily in the spring and summer  our business is highly seasonal 
for the past two fiscal years  more than of our net sales have occurred in the second and third fiscal quarters combined 
our working capital needs and our borrowings peak near the middle of our second fiscal quarter because we are generating fewer revenues while incurring expenditures in preparation for the spring selling season 
if cash on hand is insufficient to pay our obligations as they come due  including interest payments on our indebtedness  or our operating expenses  at a time when we are unable to draw on our credit facility  this seasonality could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business 
adverse weather conditions could heighten this risk 
perceptions that the products we produce and market are not safe could adversely affect us 
we manufacture and market a number of complex chemical products  such as fertilizers  growing media  herbicides and pesticides  bearing one of our brand names 
on occasion  allegations are made that some of our products have failed to perform up to expectations or have caused damage or injury to individuals or property 
based on reports of contamination at a third party supplier s vermiculite mine  the public may perceive that some of our products manufactured in the past using vermiculite are or may also be contaminated 
public perception that our products are not safe  whether justified or not  could impair our reputation  involve us in litigation  damage our brand names and have a material adverse affect our business 
the nature of certain of our products and our business success contribute to the risk that the company will be subjected to lawsuits 
the nature of certain of our products and our business success contribute to the risk that the company will be subjected to lawsuits 
the following are among the factors that contribute to this litigation risk we manufacture and market a number of complex chemical products bearing our brand names  including fertilizers  growing media  herbicides and pesticides 
there is a portion of the population that perceives all chemical products as potentially hazardous 
this perception  regardless of its merits  enhances the risk that the company will be subjected to product liability claims that allege harm from exposure to our products 
product liability claims are brought against the company from time to time 
a third party vendor supplied contaminated vermiculite ore to the company 
although our use of vermiculite ore from the contaminated source ended over twenty years ago  our former relationship with this supplier enhances the risk that the company will be subjected to personal injury and product liability claims relating to the use of vermiculite in some of our products 
we are a significant competitor in many of the markets in which we compete 
our success in our markets enhances the risk that the company will be targeted by plaintiffs lawyers  consumer groups  competitors and others asserting antitrust claims 
antitrust claims are brought against the company from time to time 
the company believes that the antitrust claims of which it is aware are without merit 
please see item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
because of the concentration of our sales to a small number of retail customers  the loss of one or more of  or significant decline in orders from  our top customers could adversely affect our financial results 
north american consumer net sales represent approximately of our worldwide net sales in fiscal our top three north american retail customers together accounted for of our north american consumer fiscal net sales and of our outstanding accounts receivable as of september  home depot  wal mart and lowe s represented approximately  and  respectively  of our fiscal north american consumer net sales 
the loss of  or reduction in orders from  home depot  wal mart  lowe s or any other significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial results  as could customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters 
our inability to collect accounts receivable from any of these customers could also have a material adverse affect 
we do not have long term sales agreements or other contractual assurances as to future sales to any of our major retail customers 
in addition  continued consolidation in the retail industry has resulted in an increasingly concentrated retail base 
to the extent such concentration continues to occur  our net sales and income from operations may be increasingly sensitive to a deterioration in the financial condition of  or other adverse developments involving our relationship with  one or more customers 
the highly competitive nature of the company s markets could adversely affect the ability of the company to grow or maintain revenues 
each of our segments participates in markets that are highly competitive 
many of our competitors sell their products at prices lower than ours  and we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  product performance  value  brand strength  supply chain competency and advertising 
some of our competitors have significant financial resources and research departments 
the strong competition that we face in all of our markets may prevent us from achieving our revenue goals  which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if monsanto were to terminate the marketing agreement for consumer roundup r products without being required to pay any termination fee  we would lose a substantial source of future earnings 
if we were to commit a serious default under the marketing agreement with monsanto for consumer roundup r products  monsanto may have the right to terminate the agreement 
if monsanto were to terminate the marketing agreement for cause  we would not be entitled to any termination fee  and we would lose all  or a significant portion  of the significant source of earnings and overhead expense absorption the marketing agreement provides 
monsanto may also be able to terminate the marketing agreement within a given region  including north america  without paying us a termination fee if sales to consumers in that region decline over a cumulative three fiscal year period  or by more than for each of two consecutive fiscal years 
hagedorn partnership  lp beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common shares 
hagedorn partnership  lp beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common shares and has sufficient voting power to significantly influence the election of directors and the approval of other actions requiring the approval of our shareholders 
compliance with environmental and other public health regulations could increase our cost of doing business 
local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters affect us in several ways 
in the united states  all products containing pesticides must be registered with the us epa and  in many cases  similar state agencies before they can be sold 
the inability to obtain or the cancellation of any registration could have an adverse effect on our business 
the severity of the effect would depend on which products were involved  whether another product could be substituted and whether our competitors were similarly affected 
we attempt to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of  and access to  substitute chemicals 
we may not always be able to avoid or minimize these risks 
the food quality protection act  enacted by the us congress in august  establishes a standard for food use pesticides that a reasonable certainty of no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures 
under this act  the us epa is evaluating the cumulative risks from dietary and non dietary exposures to pesticides 
the pesticides in our products  certain of which may be used on crops processed into various food products  continue to be evaluated by the us epa as part of this exposure risk assessment 
it is possible that the us epa or a third party active ingredient registrant may decide that a pesticide we use in our products will be limited or made unavailable to us 
for example  in june  dowagrosciences  an active ingredient registrant  voluntarily agreed to a gradual phase out of residential uses of chlorpyrifos  an active ingredient used in our lawn and garden products 
in december  the us epa reached agreement with various parties  including manufacturers of the active ingredient diazinon  regarding a phased withdrawal from retailers by december of residential uses of products containing diazinon  also used in our lawn and garden products 
we cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of the us epa s continuing evaluations of active ingredients used in our products 
the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products is regulated by various local  state  federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies 
regulations regarding the use of some pesticide and fertilizer products may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product  that the products be used only in specified locations or that certain ingredients not be used 
users may be required to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied and may be required to notify individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future 
even if we are able to comply with all such regulations and obtain all necessary registrations  we cannot assure you that our products  particularly pesticide products  will not cause injury to the environment or to people under all circumstances 
the costs of compliance  remediation or products liability have adversely affected operating results in the past and could materially affect future quarterly or annual operating results 
the harvesting of peat for our growing media business has come under increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny 
in the united states  state regulations frequently require us to limit our harvesting and to restore the property to an agreed upon condition 
in some locations  we have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water 
in the united kingdom  our peat extraction efforts are also the subject of legislation 
in addition to the regulations already described  local  state  federal and foreign agencies regulate the disposal  handling and storage of waste  air and water discharges from our facilities 
in june  the ohio epa initiated an enforcement action against us with respect to alleged surface water violations and inadequate treatment capabilities at our marysville facility and is seeking corrective action under the resource conservation recovery act 
we have met with the ohio epa and the ohio attorney general s office to negotiate an amicable resolution of these issues 
on december   an agreed judicial consent order was submitted to the union county common pleas court and was entered by the court on january in fiscal  we made million in environmental expenditures compared with approximately million in environmental capital expenditures and million in other environmental expenses in fiscal we expect spending on environmental matters in fiscal will not vary materially from the amount spent in fiscal the adequacy of these estimated future expenditures is based on our operating in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations and several significant assumptions that we have identified all of the significant sites that must be remediated  that there are no significant conditions of potential contamination that are unknown to us  and that with respect to the agreed judicial consent order in ohio  that potentially contaminated soil can be remediated in place rather than having to be removed and only specific stream segments will require remediation as opposed to the entire stream 
if there is a significant change in the facts and circumstances surrounding these assumptions or if we are found not to be in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and public health laws and regulations  it could have a material impact on future environmental capital expenditures and other environmental expenses and our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
our significant international operations make us susceptible to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and to the costs of international regulation 
we currently operate manufacturing  sales and service facilities outside of north america  particularly in the united kingdom  germany  france and the netherlands 
in fiscal  international sales accounted for approximately of our total sales 
accordingly  we are subject to risks associated with operations in foreign countries  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars  limitations on the remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries  additional costs of compliance with local regulations  and historically  in certain countries  higher rates of inflation than in the united states 
in addition  our operations outside the united states are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the costs related to our international operations could adversely affect our operations and financial results in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our ongoing business  we are exposed to certain market risks  including fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we use derivative financial and other instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
we do not enter into transactions designed to mitigate our market risks for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we have various debt instruments outstanding at september  and that are impacted by changes in interest rates 
as a means of managing our interest rate risk on these debt instruments  we enter into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert certain variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates 
at september  and  scotts had outstanding five and six interest rate swaps  respectively  with major financial institutions that effectively convert variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
the swaps have notional amounts between million and million million and million in total  respectively with three  four or five year terms commencing in january under the terms of these swaps  the company pays rates ranging from to and receives three month libor 
the following table summarizes information about our derivative financial instruments and debt instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of september  and for debt instruments  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents expected cash flows based on notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at september  and the information is presented in us dollars in millions expected maturity date fair after total value long term debt fixed rate debt average rate variable rate debt average rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps on us libor average rate expected maturity date fair after total value long term debt fixed rate debt average rate variable rate debt average rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps on us libor average rate other market risks our market risk associated with foreign currency rates is not considered to be material 
through fiscal  we had only minor amounts of transactions that were denominated in currencies other than the currency of the country of origin 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials  including urea and other chemicals and paper and plastic products 
our objectives surrounding the procurement of these materials are to ensure continuous supply and to minimize costs 
we seek to achieve these objectives through negotiation of contracts with favorable terms directly with vendors 
we do not enter into forward contracts or other market instruments as a means of achieving our objectives or minimizing our risk exposures on these materials
