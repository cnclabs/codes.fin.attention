the company s health loss ratio and its resulting quarterly earnings have improved sequentially for the past two years

in an effort to address high claims cost trends  the company implemented significant premium rate increases and redesigned its product offerings to provide for more patient responsibility for routine health care 
the company experienced declining revenues and membership over the past several years 
this is due to several factors  including the company s exit from unprofitable markets and discontinuance of unprofitable products  the difficulty individuals and small employer groups face in affording increasing health insurance premiums and the effect of a declining economy with many employer groups being forced to layoff or downsize their workforce

critical accounting policies management has identified the following items that represent the company s most sensitive and subjective accounting estimates that have or could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
these estimates required management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made 
changes to these estimates occur from period to period and may have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the company s audit committee 
liabilities for unpaid claims the company recognizes claim costs in the period the service was provided to its members 
however  claim costs incurred in a particular period are not known with certainty until after the company receives  processes and pays the claim 
the receipt and payment date of claims may lag significantly from the date the service was provided 
consequently  the company must estimate its liabilities for claims that are incurred but not yet paid 
liabilities for unpaid claims are based on an estimation process that is complex and uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
these estimates are developed using actuarial methods based upon historical data for payment patterns  medical inflation  product mix  seasonality  utilization of health care services and other relevant factors 
the amount recorded for unpaid claims liabilities is sensitive to judgments and assumptions made in the estimation process 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining utilization and inflation trends  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported  changes in the timing of claims submission patterns from providers  changes in the company s speed of processing claims and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
actual conditions could differ from those assumed in the estimation process 
due to the uncertainties associated with the factors used in these assumptions  materially different amounts could be reported in the company s statement of operations for a particular period under different conditions or using different assumptions 
as is common in the health insurance industry  the company believes that actual results may vary within a reasonable range of possible outcomes 
management believes that the company s reasonable range of actual outcomes may vary up to to of the total liabilities for unpaid claims recorded at the end of a period 
in determining the liability for unpaid claims at december   management anticipated increased utilization by the general population of mental health and other health care services in the fourth quarter of due to various factors including  as previously disclosed  the indirect impact of the september  events and subsequent bio terrorism threats and attacks 
the company did not experience a discernable adverse impact from these factors and events during  and as a result  these reserves are no longer held as of december  management considered the favorable claims experience in when it established its liabilities for unpaid claims at december  management believes that the recorded liabilities for unpaid claims at december  is in the higher end of a reasonable range of outcomes 
management closely monitors and evaluates developments and emerging trends in claims costs to determine the reasonableness of judgments made 
a retrospective test is performed on prior period claims liabilities and  as adjustments to the liabilities become necessary  the adjustments are reflected in current operations 
management believes that the amount of medical and other benefits payable is adequate to cover the company s liabilities for unpaid claims as of december  liabilities for litigation the company is involved in various legal and regulatory actions 
such actions typically involve disputes over policy coverage and benefits  but also may relate to premium rating methodology or misrepresentations  agent and employment related issues  regulatory compliance and market conduct  contractual relationships and other matters 
these disputes are resolved by settlement  dismissal or upon a decision rendered by a judge  jury or regulatory official 
in determining the amount to be recorded as a litigation reserve  judgments are generally made by management on a case by case basis based on the facts and the merits of the case  advice from outside legal counsel  the general litigation and regulatory environment of the originating state  the company s past experience with outcomes of cases in a particular jurisdiction  historical results of similar cases and other relevant factors 
management closely monitors and evaluates developments and emerging facts of each case to determine the reasonableness of the judgments and assumptions on which litigation reserves are based 
such assumptions relate to matters that are highly uncertain 
estimates could be made based on other reasonable assumptions or judgments that would differ materially from those estimates recorded 
management s evaluation of the likely outcome of these actions and the resulting estimate of the potential liability are subject to periodic adjustments  which may have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations of a future period 
during  management significantly increased its liabilities for litigation primarily due to an adverse ruling rendered against the company in a florida class action lawsuit in early  and due to other rate related cases filed against the company in certain states 
management believes that legal matters relating to the company s rating practices involve significantly more variability than the company s other legal matters 
inherent uncertainties surround legal proceedings and actual results could differ materially from those assumed in estimating the liabilities 
the possibility exists that a decision could be rendered against the company  and in some circumstances  include punitive or other damage awards in excess of amounts reserved  which may have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flow of a future period 
see item  legal proceedings for a detailed discussion of the company s material pending litigation 
new accounting standard on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
statement impacts the company in two ways 
first  goodwill is no longer amortized 
second  goodwill was subject to an initial impairment test in accordance with statement  and the remaining balance of goodwill is subject to continuing impairment testing on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change indicating a possible goodwill impairment 
the company completed the initial goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of the company s measurement of fair value was based on an evaluation of ranges of future discounted cash flows  public company trading multiples and market comparisons of similar assets and liabilities 
this evaluation utilized assumptions and projections based on the best information available to management 
certain key assumptions considered included forecasted trends in membership  revenue  medical costs  operating expenses and effective tax rates 
as a result of this initial impairment test  the company recognized a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million 
the impairment charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  the impairment charge had no impact on cash flows or the statutory basis capital and surplus of the company s insurance subsidiaries 
see the company s notes to consolidated financial statements  note  new accounting standard for a comprehensive discussion of the impact of this new accounting standard 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of cash flow consist primarily of insurance premiums  administrative fee revenue and investment income 
the primary uses of cash include payment of medical and other benefits  selling  general and administrative expenses and debt service costs 
positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of medical and other benefits and other operating expenses 
the company s investment policies are structured to provide sufficient liquidity to meet anticipated payment obligations 
the company s cash provided by operations was million for and million for the cash provided by operations included a million payment made by the company resulting from an adverse ruling in a lawsuit brought against the company by skilstaf  inc the increase in cash provided by operations from to is primarily attributable to improved underwriting margins and the receipt of funds resulting from a new pharmacy benefit management agreement 
during  the company entered into a five year pharmacy benefit management agreement  effective january  in conjunction with this agreement  the company received a million payment during the fourth quarter of substantially all of the payment was deferred and reflected in other liabilities as of december   and will be amortized on a straight line basis to income over the contract term beginning january  at the end of  the company refinanced its revolving bank line of credit agreement 
as a result  the maximum available facility increased from million to million 
in addition  the new three year agreement provides for a lump sum repayment of outstanding advances at the end of at december   the outstanding balance of advances under the credit agreement was million 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants which  among other matters  require the company to achieve certain minimum financial results  prohibit the company from paying future cash dividends and restrict or limit the company s ability to incur additional debt and dispose of assets outside the ordinary course of business 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  the company s obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by its subsidiary  american medical security holdings  inc ams holdings  and secured by pledges of stock of ams holdings and united wisconsin life insurance company  the company s principal insurance subsidiary 
in an effort to continue supporting business growth  operational efficiency  service improvements and future administrative cost savings  the company s management approved a plan to invest in an enterprise wide information technology modernization project 
the project involves the purchase of software applications and the utilization of internal and external technology and consulting resources to support most of the company s major business processes 
the design and development of the software applications is expected to begin in  with a phased implementation scheduled over the next few years 
for the past three years  the company s total capital expenditures have averaged approximately million per year 
as a result of the information technology modernization project  management anticipates total capital expenditures in to increase to approximately million 
management believes that the company s existing working capital  operating cash flow and  if necessary  available facility under its current credit agreement  will be sufficient to fund the company s anticipated future capital expenditures 
on march   the company entered into a stock purchase agreement with cobalt corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary  blue cross blue shield united of wisconsin bcbsuw  the company s then largest shareholder  to repurchase million shares of the company s common stock owned by bcbsuw at a total cost of million  including related transaction costs 
in conjunction with the stock repurchase  bcbsuw completed the sale of  shares of the company s common stock in an underwritten secondary offering during the second quarter of as a result of these transactions  bcbsuw s ownership of the company was reduced from approximately at december  to approximately at december  in january  bcbsuw sold all of its remaining shares of the company s stock 
in january  the company s board of directors approved a share repurchase program  which provides the company with the authority to repurchase up to million of its outstanding common shares 
the plan allows the company to buy back its shares  from time to time  in open market or privately negotiated transactions  subject to price and market conditions 
the share repurchase program will be funded through operating cash flow 
the company s insurance subsidiaries operate in states that require certain levels of regulatory capital and surplus and may restrict the amount of dividends that may be paid to their parent companies 
the insurance regulator in the insurer s state of domicile may disapprove any dividend which  together with other dividends paid by an insurance company in the prior months  exceeds the regulatory maximum  computed as the lesser of of statutory surplus or total statutory net gain from operations as of the end of the preceding calendar year 
in january  regulatory approval was obtained  and a  dividend was paid to the parent company by an insurance subsidiary 
based upon the financial statements of the company s insurance subsidiaries as of december   as filed with the insurance regulators  the additional aggregate amount available for dividend without regulatory approval is  the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted risk based capital rbc standards for life and health insurers designed to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to various business risks faced by such insurers 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
at december   each of the company s insurance subsidiaries had rbc ratios substantially above the levels that would require company or regulatory action 
the company does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and intends to employ its earnings in the continued development of its business 
the company s future dividend policy will depend on its earnings  capital requirements  debt covenant restrictions  financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the company s board of directors 
market risk exposure the primary investment objective of the company is to maximize investment income while controlling risks and preserving principal 
the company uses outside investment managers to manage its investment portfolio within the company s investment guidelines 
the company seeks to meet its investment objectives through diversity of coupon rates  liquidity  investment type  industry  issuer  duration and geographic location 
the company manages credit risk by seeking to maintain high average quality ratings and by limiting investments in equity securities 
at december   approximately of the company s total investment portfolio was invested in debt securities 
the bond portfolio had an average quality rating of aa at december  and  as measured by standard poor s corporation  and less than of the company s total investment portfolio was below investment grade at december  the below investment grade debt securities were investment grade when purchased and subsequently downgraded 
none of the below investment grade securities were in default at december  almost the entire portfolio was classified as available for sale 
the market value of available for sale securities exceeded amortized cost by million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company had no investment mortgage loans  nonpublicly traded securities  real estate held for investment or financial derivatives 
the primary market risk affecting the company is interest rate risk 
assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates  the net hypothetical decline in fair value of shareholders equity is estimated to be million after tax at december  this amount represents approximately of the company s shareholders equity 
at december   the fair value of the company s outstanding balance of advances under the credit agreement approximated the carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the company s weighted average short term borrowing rate at december   and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
inflation health care costs have been rising and are expected to continue to rise at a rate that exceeds the consumer price index 
the company s cost control measures and premium rate increases are designed to reduce the adverse effect of medical cost inflation on its operations 
in addition  the company uses its underwriting and medical management capabilities to help control inflation in health care costs 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will fully offset the impact of inflation or that premium revenue increases will equal or exceed increasing health care costs 
cautionary factors this report and other documents or oral presentations prepared or delivered by and on behalf of the company contain or may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the united states private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are statements based upon management s expectations at the time such statements are made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in the statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements 
when used in written documents or oral presentations  the terms anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  objective  plan  possible  potential  project  will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such statements  factors that could impact our business and financial prospects include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those discussed from time to time in the company s various filings with the securities and exchange commission or in other publicly disseminated written documents medical claims and health care costs 
if the company is unable to accurately estimate medical claims and control health care costs  its results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
the company estimates the costs of its future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods based upon historical data  medical inflation  product mix  seasonality  utilization of health care services and other relevant factors 
the company establishes premiums based on these methods 
the premiums the company charges its customers generally are fixed for one year periods  and therefore  costs the company incurs in excess of its medical claim projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums 
certain factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to vary from what the company estimated and reflected in premiums 
these factors may include o an increase in the rates charged by providers of health care services and supplies  including pharmaceuticals  o higher than expected use of health care services by members  o the occurrence of bioterrorism  catastrophes or epidemics  o changes in the demographics of members and medical trends affecting them  and o new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that increase the company s costs 
the occurrence of any of these factors  which are beyond the company s control  could result in a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulations 
the company conducts business in a heavily regulated industry  and changes in government regulation could increase the costs of compliance or cause the company to discontinue marketing its products in certain states 
the company s business is extensively regulated by federal and state authorities 
some of the new federal and state regulations promulgated under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  relating to health care reform will require the company to implement additional changes in its current programs and systems in order to maintain compliance  which will increase the company s expenses 
federal and state legislatures are considering health care reform measures including a patients bill of rights  which may result in higher medical costs 
congress is also considering legislation allowing small employers to form association health plans exempt from state insurance regulations  which may impact the risk profile of employers willing to purchase insurance from the company 
in addition  the implementation of prompt pay laws  whereby a claim must be paid in a certain number of days regardless of whether it is a valid claim or not  subject to a right of recovery  may have a negative effect on the company s results of operations 
the company is also subject to periodic changes in state laws and regulations regarding the selection and pricing of risks 
new regulations regarding these issues could increase the company s costs and decrease its premiums 
the company has in the past  and may in the future  decide to discontinue marketing its products in states which have enacted  or are considering  various health care reform regulations 
regulatory compliance 
the company s failure to comply with new or existing government regulation could subject it to significant fines and penalties 
the company s efforts to measure  monitor and adjust its business practices to comply with the law are ongoing 
failure to comply with enacted regulations  including the laws mentioned above  could require the company to pay refunds or result in significant fines  penalties  or the loss of one or more of its licenses 
the company has been subject to regulatory penalties  assessments and restitution orders in a number of states in which it operates 
the company is currently subject to a regulatory proceeding in florida in which the company has appealed an order  which has been stayed  by the florida department of insurance to suspend the license of the company s primary insurance subsidiary to sell new business but not renewal business in florida for one year 
for additional information concerning the regulatory proceeding in florida  see item  legal proceedings 
from time to time the company is also subject to inquiries in other states related to its rating activities and other practices 
the result of these regulatory actions is unknown and may have a material adverse effect on the company 
furthermore  federal and state laws and regulations continue to evolve 
the costs of compliance may cause the company to change its operations significantly  or adversely impact the health care provider networks with which the company does business  which may adversely affect its business and results of operations 
litigation 
the company is subject to class actions and other forms of litigation in the ordinary course of its business  including litigation based on new or evolving legal theories  which could result in significant liabilities and costs 
the nature of the company s business subjects it to a variety of legal actions and claims relating but not limited to the following o denial of health care benefits  o disputes over rating methodology and practices or termination of coverage  o disputes with agents over compensation or other matters  o disputes related to claim administration errors and failure to disclose network rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements  o disputes over co payment calculations  and o customer audits of compliance with the company s plan obligations 
in addition  a florida circuit court has found the company liable for damages in a class action lawsuit in florida 
the trial date for the damages portion of the lawsuit has not yet been scheduled 
further  the company is involved in a number of lawsuits in various states alleging misrepresentation by the company of its renewal rating methodology 
for additional information  see item  legal proceedings 
the company cannot predict with certainty the outcome of lawsuits against the company or the potential costs involved 
competition 
competition in the company s industry may limit its ability to attract new members or to maintain its existing membership in force 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  benefit plan design  strength of provider networks  quality of customer service  reputation and quality of agent relations 
the company competes for members with other health insurance providers and managed care companies  many of whom have larger membership in regional markets and greater financial resources 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to compete effectively in this industry 
as a result  the company may be unable to attract new members or maintain its existing membership and its revenues may be adversely affected 
business growth strategy 
the company s future operating performance is largely dependent on its ability to execute its growth strategy 
the company has experienced a decline in membership over the last several years as part of its strategy to improve profitability and exit certain markets 
the company s challenge is to increase the number of individuals and small employer groups purchasing its products and services while encouraging its current preferred membership to retain their business relationship with the company 
the company has expanded and realigned its sales organization  introduced new products  established new distribution channels for its medone sm products  expanded its agent recruitment efforts and developed incentive programs to improve productivity 
if the company initiatives are not successful and the company does not meet its growth goals  the company s future operating performance may be adversely affected 
information systems 
a failure of the company s information system could adversely affect its business 
information processing is critical to the company s business 
the company depends on its information system for timely and accurate information 
the company s failure to maintain an effective and efficient information system or disruptions in its information system could cause disruptions in its business operations  including any of the following o failure to comply with prompt pay laws  o loss of existing members  o difficulty in attracting new members  o disputes with members  providers and agents  o regulatory problems  o increases in administrative expenses  and o other adverse consequences 
beginning in  the company is investing in an enterprise wide information technology modernization project involving the purchase of software applications to support most of the company s major processes 
the design and development of the software applications is expected to begin in  with a phased implementation scheduled over the next few years 
although the company is taking measures to safeguard against disruptions to its information systems during this process  it cannot provide assurance that disruptions will not occur or that the project will be successfully implemented or implemented on schedule 
independent agent relationships 
the company depends on the services of non exclusive independent agents and brokers to market its products to potential customers 
the company cannot provide assurance that they will continue to market the company s products in the future or that they will not refer the company s members to competitors 
the company markets its products solely through non exclusive  independent agents and brokers 
they frequently market the health insurance products of competitors as well as the company s products 
most of the company s contracts with agents and brokers are terminable without cause upon days notice by either party 
the company faces intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers  and the company cannot provide assurance that agents and brokers will continue to market the company s products and services 
negative publicity 
negative publicity regarding the company s business practices and about the health insurance industry may harm the company s business and operating results 
in  the company was subject to negative national publicity surrounding its medone sm rating practices and related legal matters  which management believes harmed the company s medone sm new member enrollment during the last half of the company changed its rating practices in all medone sm markets effective january  adverse publicity about the company s rating practices or other matters in the future may affect sales of the company s products  which could impede the company s growth plans 
in addition  the health insurance industry  in general  has received negative publicity and does not have a positive public perception 
this publicity and perception may lead to increased legislation  regulation  review of industry practices and private litigation 
these factors may adversely affect the company s ability to market its products  increase the regulatory burdens under which the company operates  further increasing the costs of doing business and adversely affecting operating results 
insurance risk management 
if the company s insurers or reinsurers do not perform their obligations or offer affordable coverage with reasonable deductibles or limits  the company could experience significant losses 
the company s risk management program includes several insurance policies it has purchased to cover various property  business and other risks of loss 
in addition  the company carries policies to cover its directors and officers 
many of the carriers marketing these lines of coverage are experiencing unfavorable claims experience and loss of their own reinsurance coverage 
several carriers have exited markets and no longer offer certain lines of coverage 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the company will be able to purchase insurance coverages for its own risk management at affordable premiums or with reasonable deductibles and policy limits 
the company has entered into and may continue to enter into a variety of reinsurance arrangements under which it cedes business to other insurance companies to mitigate large claims risk 
although reinsurance allows for greater diversification of risk relating to potential losses arising from large claims  the company remains liable if these other insurance companies fail to perform their obligations 
as a result  any failure of an insurance company to perform its obligations under an agreement could expose the company to significant losses 
also  there is no assurance that the company will be able to purchase reinsurance at affordable premiums 
personnel 
loss of key personnel and the inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company is dependent on the continued services of its management team  including its key executives 
loss of such personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on the company
