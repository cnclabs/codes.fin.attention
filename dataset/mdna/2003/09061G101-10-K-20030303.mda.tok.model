we anticipate a need for additional financing to fund our future operations  including the commercialization of our drug products currently under development 
we cannot provide assurance that additional financing will be obtained or  if obtained  will be available on reasonable terms or in a timely manner 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the progress  timing and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  the time and cost necessary to develop commercial manufacturing processes  including quality systems and to build or acquire manufacturing capabilities  the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments  and any changes made or new developments in our existing collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships or any new collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish

critical accounting policies investment in biomarin genzyme llc and related revenue under the terms of our joint venture agreement with genzyme  genzyme and we have each agreed to provide percent of the funding for the joint venture 
all research and development  sales and marketing  and other activities performed by genzyme and us on behalf of the joint venture are billed to the joint venture at cost

accordingly  we record a reduction in our investment in the joint venture for our percent share of the loss of the joint venture 
the costs incurred by us on behalf of the joint venture that are funded by us percent are recorded as a reduction of the company s loss from the joint venture 
impairment of long lived assets we regularly review long lived assets and identifiable intangibles 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
at the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their fair values 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset  the principal amount of which is the tax effect of net operating loss carryforwards  of approximately million at december  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies have been considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase or decrease income in the period such adjustment was made

in addition  we have segregated the glyko  inc operating results and cash flows in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  changes in stockholders equity and cash flows 
the loss on disposal of discontinued operations for the year ended december   primarily reflects certain adjustments required to record an impairment reserve against the unamortized goodwill related to glyko  inc of approximately million 
the aggregate net loss from glyko inc s operations since its acquisition in was million through december   excluding the loss on disposal of discontinued operations discussed above 
stock option plans we have three stock based compensation plans 
we account for those plans under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees whereby generally no stock based compensation cost is reflected in our net loss 
we recognize as an expense  the fair value of options granted to nonemployees 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets on january  adoption of these pronouncements did not have a material impact on our net loss 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  on january  this requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the carrying value of our goodwill was reduced to zero in adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our net loss 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs was adopted by us in the fourth quarter of adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our net loss 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which clarifies disclosure and recognition measurement requirements related to certain guarantees

fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structures used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of stock based employee compensation and revised disclosure requirements  was issued in december the revised disclosure requirements were adopted by us in the fourth quarter of adoption of this pronouncement did not have material impact on our net loss 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments with highly rated credit issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we seek to improve the safety and likelihood of preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore are not subject to foreign exchange risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
based on our investment portfolio and interest rates at december   we believe that a basis point change in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of approximately million  respectively  in the fair value of the investment portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the investment portfolio  however  we will not recognize such gains or losses unless the investments are sold 
the table below presents the carrying value of our investment portfolio  which approximates fair value at december  in thousands carrying value cash and cash equivalents short term investments total invested in united states agency securities  in a p rated commercial paper and in corporate bonds 
our debt obligations consist of our equipment based loans and capital lease obligations  which carry fixed interest rates and  as a result  we are not exposed to interest rate market risk on our loans
