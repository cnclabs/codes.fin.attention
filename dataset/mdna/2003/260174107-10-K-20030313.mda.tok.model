this facility does not include dover downs  inc  as it was spun off effective march  a total of million of the amount outstanding under the previous dvd credit facilities was paid down on april  through a new credit facility that was established by gaming 
the terms of the dvd credit facility contain certain covenants including minimum tangible net worth  fixed charge coverage and maximum leverage ratio requirements 
the company would not have been in compliance with the leverage ratio covenant at december   but on january  the company and its banks amended this covenant effective december  and through the expiration date of the facility

the company expects capital expenditures of approximately  during these projects primarily relate to improvements necessary to promote our inaugural grand prix of st 
petersburg event held on february   as well as  various improvements at our fixed facilities 
the company expects that its net cash flows from operating activities and funds available from its credit facility will be sufficient to provide for its working capital needs and capital spending requirements at least through  as well as any cash dividends the board of directors may declare

interest only payments were required until september   and were made from a capitalized interest fund established from the bond proceeds 
the principal payments range from  in september to  in the capitalized interest fund was depleted in september  at which time the debt service on the bonds became payable solely from sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
if the taxes are insufficient for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  payments would be made pursuant to the letter of credit 
the company believes that the sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility will satisfy the necessary debt service requirements of the bonds 
as of december    was available in the sales and incremental property tax fund maintained by wilson county to pay the remaining principal and interest due under the bonds 
during   was paid by the company into the sales and incremental property tax fund and  was deducted from the fund for debt and interest service 
in  we expect the payments into the fund to exceed the debt and interest service 
if the debt service is not satisfied from the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility  the bonds would become a liability of the company 
if we fail to maintain the letter of credit that secures the bonds or we allow an uncured default to exist under our reimbursement agreement relative to the letter of credit  the bonds would be immediately redeemable

as of december   dvd s consolidated balance sheet included a  payable to gaming for these costs and for other payments made by gaming on dvd s behalf 
the allocation was based on both an allocation to the business that directly incurred the costs and an analysis of each company s share of the costs 
the net costs incurred by each company for these services are not necessarily indicative of the costs that would have been incurred if the companies had been separate  independent entities and or had otherwise independently managed these functions  however  management believes that these allocations are reasonable

index to financial statements in august  certain existing shareholders of the company  including two directors  acquired from the company  shares of its common stock for net proceeds of  the shares of common stock were sold in an unregistered private offering to accredited investors at fair value based on the closing market price of the company s common stock on the day preceding the sale which was per share 
at the date of the acquisition of grand prix   was due to grand prix from certain shareholders officers for outstanding loans made for the purpose of purchasing grand prix common stock 
as of december    was outstanding from a director of the company 
this remaining balance was repaid in full in january critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those the company considers critical in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
the descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity 
goodwill the company has made acquisitions in the past that included goodwill 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in effect through december   these assets were amortized over their estimated useful lives  and were tested periodically to determine if they were recoverable from operating earnings on an undiscounted basis over their useful lives 
effective january   goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is typically less than values based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
we completed our analysis of impairment of our goodwill during the second quarter of  as a result of adopting the transitional provisions of statement no 
 and recorded a non cash charge of  we completed the annual impairment test in november and determined that there was no additional impairment 
additional impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of this impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
at december   the remaining balance of goodwill is income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company records a tax valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
currently  the company maintains a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating loss carry forwards 
the company has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize all or a portion of these deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its remaining deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets of  net of an allowance of  overall  the company has a net deferred tax liability of  
index to financial statements accrued pension cost the benefits provided by the company s defined benefit pension plans are based on years of service and employee s remuneration over their employment with the company 
the company establishes accrued pension costs in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
accrued pension costs are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider a number of factors  including estimates for discount rate  assumed rate of compensation increase  and expected long term rate of return on assets 
changes in these estimates would impact the amounts that the company records in its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable reserves the company provides for losses on accounts receivable based upon their current status  historical experience and management s evaluation of existing economic conditions 
significant changes in customer profitability or general economic conditions may have a significant effect on the company s allowance for doubtful accounts 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment and up to years for facilities 
these estimates require assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment annually and when an event occurs that indicates an impairment may exist 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
the company adopted the provisions of statement no 
effective january   at which time the company ceased to record amortization expense related to its goodwill 
the adoption of statement no 
resulted in a  reduction in amortization expense in as compared to to comply with the transitional provisions of statement no 
 we determined our reporting units and assigned goodwill and other net assets to those reporting units 
goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units at january  was tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value was primarily determined through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology from an independent appraisal 
to the extent fair value was determined to be less than the carrying value  fair value was then allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets resulting in an implied valuation of the goodwill associated with the reporting unit 
based on this analysis of goodwill  the company recorded a non cash charge of  associated with the goodwill of grand prix as a cumulative effect of an accounting change for the write off of goodwill in goodwill associated with grand prix  which was acquired through a tax free merger  is not deductible for income tax purposes and represents a permanent difference for which no current or deferred income tax liabilities are recorded 
as such  no income tax benefit was recognized from the impairment write off 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
statement no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  a gain or loss on settlement would be recognized 
we are required and plan to adopt the provisions of statement no 
in the adoption of statement no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

given these risks and uncertainties  stockholders should not overly rely or attach undue weight to our forward looking statements as an indication of our actual future results 
our relationship with sanctioning bodies is vital to our success in motorsports our continued success in motorsports is dependent upon keeping a good working relationship with the governing bodies of motorsports that sanction national racing events 
these governing bodies include nascar  cart  irl and nhra 
the governing bodies regularly issue and award sanctioned events and their issuance depends  in large part  on maintaining good working relationships with the sanctioning bodies 
many events are sanctioned on an annual basis with no obligation to renew  including our agreements with nascar 
by awarding a sanctioned event or a series of sanctioned events  the sanctioning bodies do not warrant  nor are they responsible for  the financial success of any sanctioned event 
our inability to obtain additional sanctioned events in the future and to maintain sanction agreements at current levels would likely result in lower than anticipated revenues from admissions  sponsorships  hospitality  concessions  and merchandise  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on sponsorship contracts to generate revenues we receive a substantial portion of our annual revenues from sponsorship agreements  including the sponsorship of our various events and our permanent venues  such as title  official product and promotional partner sponsorships  billboards  signage and skyboxes 
loss of our title sponsors or other major sponsorship agreements or failure to secure such sponsorship agreements in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
increased government regulation of sponsors and restrictions on advertising could substantially reduce our advertising revenue we receive a significant portion of our revenue from sponsorship and advertising by various companies 
tobacco and liquor companies have traditionally sponsored motorsports events 
in  major tobacco companies entered into an agreement with federal negotiators and various states attorneys general whereby the tobacco companies agreed to give up certain advertising and promotional activity in exchange for liability limits in pending and future lawsuits 
new laws or settlements could have a material adverse effect on the tobacco and liquor industry motorsports sponsorship and advertising expenditures 
government regulations and restrictions on advertising by tobacco companies  liquor companies and other potential sponsors could adversely impact revenues as well as the revenues of the motorsports industry as a whole 
while we believe that the popularity of motorsports would allow us and the industry to secure alternate sponsors  there is no assurance that alternate sponsors could be obtained 
our motorsports events face intense competition for attendance  television viewership and sponsorship we compete with other auto speedways for the patronage of motor racing spectators as well as for promotions and sponsorships 
moreover  racing events sanctioned by different organizations are often held on the same dates at different tracks 
the quality of the competition  type of racing event  caliber of the event  sight lines  ticket pricing  location and customer conveniences  among other things  distinguish the motorsports facilities 
in addition  all of our events compete with other sports and recreational events scheduled on the same dates 
as a result  our revenues and 
index to financial statements operations are affected not only by our ability to compete in the motorsports promotion market  but also by the availability of alternative spectator sports events  forms of entertainment and changing consumer preferences 
our street races depend on city permits and good relationships with city officials and others in order to conduct the grand prix of long beach  we must obtain an annual permit from the city of long beach to hold the race on city streets 
although grand prix has operated a racing event on the streets of long beach for twenty eight years  there can be no assurance that this event will continue to be held or be successful 
similarly  the grand prix of denver and the grand prix of st 
petersburg require that we obtain a variety of licenses and permits 
our agreements with the cities of denver and st 
petersburg extend through and  respectively 
our ability to conduct street races requires that we maintain excellent relationships with the host city and its officials 
furthermore  a portion of the grand prix of denver is run on property leased to us by the pepsi center 
therefore  we must maintain an excellent relationship with management of the pepsi center 
grand prix s ability to meet payment obligations under a loan agreement with an illinois government agency depends on revenues from gateway in order to finance the redevelopment of gateway international raceway  grand prix entered into a loan agreement with the southwest illinois development authority  which agreed to fund a loan to grand prix by issuing municipal bonds in the aggregate principal amount of  the bonds are unconditionally guaranteed by grand prix 
grand prix issued a year  promissory note to swida which bears interest at an effective rate of approximately per annum 
payments on the swida loan are intended to be made primarily from the revenues from the operations of gateway 
although grand prix is current on its obligation and expects to meet its future debt payment obligations out of the revenues from gateway  and although grand prix will receive certain assistance from the city of madison  illinois in the form of a tax increment finance fund which should assist it in meeting its debt burdens  there can be no assurance that earnings from the future operations of gateway will be sufficient to meet grand prix s debt service obligations 
a default under the swida loan could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the sales tax and property tax revenues to service the revenue bonds for infrastructure improvements at nashville may be inadequate in september  the sports authority of wilson county  tennessee issued  in revenue bonds  of which  is outstanding on december   to build local infrastructure improvements which benefit the operation of nashville superspeedway 
interest only payments were required until september  and were made from a capitalized interest fund established from bond proceeds 
the capitalized interest fund was depleted in september  at which time the debt service on the bonds became payable solely from sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
as of december    was available in the sales and incremental property tax fund maintained by wilson county to pay the remaining principal and interest due under the bonds 
during   was paid by the company into the sales and incremental property tax fund and  was deducted from the fund for debt and interest service 
in  we expect the payments into the fund to exceed the debt and interest service 
in the event the taxes are insufficient to cover the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  payments will be made under a  irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by several banks pursuant to a reimbursement and security agreement under which we have agreed to reimburse the banks for drawings made under the letter of credit 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the seasonality of our motorsports events increases the variability of quarterly earnings our business has been  and is expected to remain  seasonal given that it depends on our outdoor events for a substantial portion of revenues 
we derive a substantial portion of our motorsports revenues from admissions and event related revenue attributable to six nascar sanctioned events at dover  delaware which are currently held in june and september 
this has been offset to some degree by our other motorsports events  but quarterly earnings will vary 

index to financial statements our insurance may not be adequate to cover catastrophic incidents we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient  in the opinion of management  to protect us from material financial loss incurred in the ordinary course of business 
we also purchase special event insurance for motorsports events to protect against race related liability 
however  there can be no assurance that this insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 
if we are held liable for damages beyond the scope of our insurance coverage  including punitive damages  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
bad weather can have an adverse financial impact on our motorsports events we sponsor and promote outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things at these events 
although we sell many tickets well in advance of the outdoor events and these tickets are issued on a non refundable basis  poor weather conditions may adversely affect additional ticket sales  and concessions and souvenir sales  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently maintain weather related insurance for major events 
due to the importance of clear visibility and safe driving conditions to motorsports racing events  outdoor racing events may be significantly affected by weather patterns and seasonal weather changes 
any unanticipated weather changes could impact our ability to stage events 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
postponement and or cancellation of major motorsports events could adversely affect us if one of our events is postponed because of weather or other reasons such as  for example  the general postponement of all major sporting events in this country following the september   terrorism attacks  we could incur increased expenses associated with conducting the rescheduled event  as well as possible decreased revenues from tickets  food  drinks and merchandise at the rescheduled event 
if such an event is cancelled  we could incur the expenses associated with preparing to conduct the event as well as losing the revenues  including live broadcast revenues associated with the event 
if a cancelled event is part of the nascar winston cup series or nascar busch series  we could experience a reduction in the amount of money received from television revenues for all of our nascar sanctioned events in the series that experienced the cancellation 
this would occur if  as a result of the cancellation  and without regard to whether the cancelled event was scheduled for one of our facilities  nascar experienced a reduction in television revenues greater than the amount scheduled to be paid to the promoter of the cancelled event 
our goodwill may become further impaired in the future and require a write down to comply with accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
we adopted the provisions of statement no 
effective january  and as a result recorded a non cash charge of  associated with the goodwill of grand prix as a cumulative effect of accounting change in even after this charge  approximately  or  of our total assets as of december   consists of goodwill 
if in the future the application of the test for impairment of goodwill results in a reduction in the carrying value of the goodwill  we will be required to record the amount of the reduction in goodwill as a non cash charge against operating earnings which would also reduce our stockholders equity 

index to financial statements item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the carrying values of dvd s long term debt approximates its fair value at december  and dvd is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates for its variable rate borrowings of  at december  under its revolving credit facility 
a change in interest rates of one percent on the balance outstanding at december  would cause a change in total annual interest costs of in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson  tennessee issued its variable rate tax exempt infrastructure revenue bonds  series  in the amount of  dvd is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates for these bonds 
a significant change in interest rates could result in the company being responsible for debt service payments not covered by the capitalized interest fund or the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility
