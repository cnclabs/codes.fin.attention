critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses mks consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory  intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets  in process research and development  merger expenses  income taxes and investments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is recorded upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer provided that there is evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
the company has no obligations to customers after the date products are shipped other than pursuant to warranty obligations 
the company provides for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue 
shipping and handling fees  if any  billed to customers are recognized as revenue 
the related shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales 
the company monitors and tracks the amount of product returns  provides for accounts receivable allowances and reduces revenue at the time of shipment for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience 
while product returns and warranty costs have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that the company will continue to experience the same return rates and warranty repair costs that it has in the past 
any significant increase in product return rates or a significant increase in the cost to repair the company s products could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or increased costs materialize 
the company makes estimates evaluating its accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that the company has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established  there is no assurance that the company will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of the company s customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of accounts receivable and the company s future operating results 
inventory 
the company values its inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost  based primarily on its estimated forecast of product demand 
as demonstrated during and  demand for the company s products can fluctuate significantly 
the company recorded significant charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million in the charges were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand including reduced demand for older technology products 
a significant increase in the demand for the company s product could result in an increase or decrease in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the charges for excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  the company s industry is subject to technological change  new product development  and product technological obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and its reported operating results 
intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets 
the company reviews intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
factors the company consider important which could indicate an impairment include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the asset or the strategy for the company s overall business and significant and negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company compares the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is determined based on estimates and judgment regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  the company may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its net realizable value 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the discounted cash flow approach  and is dependent on estimates and judgments related to future cash flows and discount rates 
in process research and development 
the company values tangible and intangible assets acquired through our business acquisitions at fair value including in process research and development ipr d 
the company determines ipr d through established valuation techniques for various projects for the development of new products and technologies and expenses ipr d when technical feasibility is not reached 
the value of ipr d is determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 
each project is analyzed and estimates and judgments are made to determine the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of completion 
during and  the company expensed approximately million and million  respectively  in ipr d charges primarily related to the eni acquisition and the on line acquisition because the technological feasibility of certain products under development had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
if mks acquires other companies with ipr d in the future  the company will value the ipr d through established valuation techniques and incur future ipr d charges if those products under development have not reached technical feasibility 
income taxes 
the company evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
the future benefit to be derived from its deferred tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the assets 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that may be more likely than not to be realized 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance  an expense will be recorded within the provision for income taxes line on the statement of income 
during the year ended december   the company established a full valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets 
in periods subsequent to establishing a valuation allowance  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its net deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
also in future periods  if the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize the recorded amount of its remaining net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded as an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total net sales of certain line items included in mks consolidated statement of income data year ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets restructuring and asset impairment charges merger expenses purchase of in process technology income loss from operations interest income expense  net income from litigation settlement other expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss year ended compared to net sales 
net sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  international net sales were approximately million for the year ended december  or of net sales and million for the year ended december  or of net sales 
the increase in worldwide net sales in is from the incremental partial year revenues of million from eni  tenta and ipc  companies which were acquired during the year 
this increase was offset by a decline of million or  due to the worldwide slowdown in demand for the company s products from the company s semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer and semiconductor device manufacturer customers  which began in the first quarter of and continued through the semiconductor capital equipment industry has been cyclical  and the company cannot determine how long the downturn will last 
in the absence of significant improvement  net sales could continue to decline or remain low  and the amount of goodwill  other long lived assets  and inventory considered realizable could be significantly reduced 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower provisions for excess and obsolete inventory in compared to in  the company recorded significant charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million  or of net sales 
these charges were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand  including demand for older technology products 
during  the company realized a benefit of million in cost of sales  or of net sales  from sales of inventory which were included as part of the excess and obsolete inventory charges in the lower excess and obsolete inventory charges in were offset by the addition of manufacturing overhead costs from the companies acquired in  which resulted in a decrease in gross margin of approximately

the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  based on their estimated fair values 
the intangible assets include approximately million for acquired in process technology for projects  generally expected to have durations of months  that did not have future alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process technology was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value 
each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included  the utilization of core technology  the complexity  cost and time to complete development  any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the stage of completion 
the cash flows derived from the in process technology projects were discounted at rates ranging from to 
the company believes these rates were appropriate given the risks associated with the technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been established 
the percentage of completion for each in process project was determined by identifying the cost incurred to date of the project as a ratio of the total cost required to bring the project to technical and commercial feasibility 
the percentage completion for in process projects acquired ranged from to complete  based on management s estimates of tasks completed and the tasks to be completed to bring the projects to technological and commercial feasibility

the actual amount of the accumulated adjustments account was million 
accordingly  the company made an additional distribution of million  plus interest of million  to the pre ipo stockholders during the three months ended september  the amount of the additional distribution payable had been estimated to be million 
this estimated amount was charged directly to retained earnings during and had no impact on net income or earnings per share 
the difference of million between the actual additional distribution and the estimated additional distribution was credited directly to retained earnings during the three months ended september  and had no impact on net income or earnings per share 
the amount of the accumulated adjustments account can be affected by future income tax audits of mks 
if any audit increases or decreases the accumulated adjustments account  mks or the pre ipo stockholders  as the case may be  will also be required to make a payment  with interest  of such difference to the other party 
no shareholders  other than the pre ipo stockholders  are parties to the tax indemnification and s corporation distribution agreement 
to the extent permitted by massachusetts law  the company s restated articles of organization  as amended  requires the company to indemnify any current or former officer or director of the company or any person who has served or is serving in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan of the company 
because no claim for indemnification has been made by any person covered by the relevant provisions of the company s restated articles of organization  the company believes that its estimated exposure for these indemnification obligations is currently minimal 
accordingly  the company has no liabilities recorded for these requirements as of december  the company enters into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to these agreements  the company indemnifies  holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party  generally the company s customers  in connection with any patent  or any other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to the company s products 
the term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is  in some instances  unlimited 
the company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  the company believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  the company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  when as part of an acquisition  the company acquires all of the stock or all of the assets and liabilities of another company  the company assumes liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make for such obligations is undeterminable at this time 
other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the acquisitions  historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications 
accordingly  no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations 
in conjunction with certain asset sales  the company may provide routine indemnifications whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly defined 
where appropriate  an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability 
because the amount of liability under these types of indemnifications are not explicitly stated  the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated 
other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the asset sale  historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications 
derivatives the company conducts its operations globally 
consequently the results of our operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany sales of inventory  over a maximum period of fifteen months  using forward exchange contracts and currency options primarily related to japanese and european currencies 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges  and changes in their fair value are carried in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction affects earnings 
when the hedged transaction affects earnings  the appropriate gain or loss from the derivative designated as a hedge of the transaction is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to cost of sales 
as of december  the amount that will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings over the next twelve months is an unrealized loss of million  net of taxes 
the ineffective portion of the derivatives is primarily related to option premiums  is recorded in cost of sales  and was immaterial in   and the company hedges certain intercompany and other payables with foreign exchange contracts and currency options 
since these derivatives hedge existing amounts that are denominated in foreign currencies  the derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting 
the foreign exchange gain on these derivatives was not material in  and realized and unrealized gains and losses on forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased option contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in earnings 
the cash flows resulting from forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options that qualify for hedge accounting are classified in the statement of cash flows as part of cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows resulting from forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified in the statement of cash flows as investing activities 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
there were forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling million outstanding at december  of such forward exchange contracts  million were outstanding to exchange japanese yen for us dollars 
there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling million to exchange japanese yen for us dollars were outstanding at december  local currency purchased options with notional amounts totaling million  million and million to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars were outstanding at december   and  respectively 
foreign exchange gains and losses on forward exchange contracts and currency options which did not qualify for hedge accounting were immaterial during and there were no foreign exchange gains or losses on forward exchange contracts which did not qualify for hedge accounting in gains and losses on forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options that qualify for hedge accounting are classified in cost of goods sold and totaled a gain of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and was immaterial in the fair values of local currency purchased options at december  and  which were obtained through dealer quotes were immaterial

additionally  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transitional requirements of sfas are effective for all financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted the disclosure provisions of this statement as of december  the application of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
variable interest entities have been commonly referred to as special purpose entities or off balance sheet structures 
this interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the company does not expect that this interpretation will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses revenue recognition on arrangements encompassing multiple elements that are delivered at different points in time  defining criteria that must be met for elements to be considered to be a separate unit of accounting

eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company does not expect that the pronouncement will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results mks business depends substantially on capital spending in the semiconductor industry which is characterized by periodic fluctuations that may cause a reduction in demand for mks products 
mks estimates that approximately of its sales during  of its sales during  and of its sales during were to semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers  and it expects that sales to such customers will continue to account for a substantial majority of its sales 
mks business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device manufacturers  which in turn depend upon the demand for semiconductors 
periodic reductions in demand for the products manufactured by semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers may adversely affect mks business  financial condition and results of operations 
historically  the semiconductor market has been highly cyclical and has experienced periods of overcapacity  resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment 
for example  in and  the semiconductor capital equipment industry experienced significant declines  which caused a number of mks customers to reduce their orders 
more recently  in and  mks has experienced a significant reduction in demand from oem customers  and lower gross margins due to reduced absorption of manufacturing overhead 
mks incurred significant charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million in the charges were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand including reduced demand for older technology products 
in addition  many semiconductor manufacturers have operations and customers in asia  a region which in recent years has experienced serious economic problems including currency devaluations  debt defaults  lack of liquidity and recessions 
mks cannot be certain that semiconductor downturns will not recur 
a decline in the level of orders as a result of any future downturn or slowdown in the semiconductor capital equipment industry could have a material adverse effect on mks business  financial condition and results of operations 
mks quarterly operating results have varied  and are likely to continue to vary significantly 
this may result in volatility in the market price for mks shares 
a substantial portion of mks shipments occur shortly after an order is received and therefore mks operates with a low level of backlog 
as a result  a decrease in demand for mks products from one or more customers could occur with limited advance notice and could have a material adverse effect on mks results of operations in any particular period 
a significant percentage of mks expenses are relatively fixed and based in part on expectations of future net sales 
the inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any shortfall would magnify the adverse impact of a shortfall in net sales on mks results of operations 
factors that could cause fluctuations in mks net sales include the timing of the receipt of orders from major customers  shipment delays  disruption in sources of supply  seasonal variations of capital spending by customers  production capacity constraints  and specific features requested by customers 
for example  mks was in the process of increasing its production capacity when the semiconductor capital equipment market began to experience a significant downturn in this downturn had a material adverse effect on mks operating results in the second half of and the first half of after an increase in business in the latter half of  the market experienced another downturn in  which had a material adverse effect on mks and first quarter operating results 
more recently  the semiconductor capital equipment market experienced a significant downturn during and as a result  mks has experienced a reduction in demand from oem customers  which has had a material adverse effect on mks operating results 
during gross margins were negatively affected by significant charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million in the charges were primarily caused by a significant reduction in demand including reduced demand for older technology products 
as a result of the factors discussed above  it is likely that mks will in the future experience quarterly or annual fluctuations and that  in one or more future quarters  its operating results will fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in any such event  the price of mks common stock could decline significantly 
the loss of net sales to any one of mks major customers would likely have a material adverse effect on mks 
mks top ten customers accounted for approximately of its net sales in  of its net sales in and of its net sales in the loss of a major customer or any reduction in orders by these customers  including reductions due to market or competitive conditions  would likely have a material adverse effect on mks business  financial condition and results of operations 
during  and  one customer  applied materials  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of mks net sales 
none of mks significant customers  including applied materials  has entered into an agreement requiring it to purchase any minimum quantity of mks products 
the demand for mks products from its semiconductor capital equipment customers depends in part on orders received by them from their semiconductor device manufacturer customers 
attempts to lessen the adverse effect of any loss or reduction through the rapid addition of new customers could be difficult because prospective customers typically require lengthy qualification periods prior to placing volume orders with a new supplier 
mks future success will continue to depend upon its ability to maintain relationships with existing key customers  its ability to attract new customers  and the success of its customers in creating demand for their capital equipment products which incorporate mks products 
as part of mks business strategy  mks has entered into and may enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate  disrupt its business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
mks acquired compact instrument technology  llc compact instrument in march  telvac engineering  ltd 
telvac in may  spectra instruments  llc spectra in july  dip  inc dip in september  applied science and technology  inc astex in january  on line technologies  inc on line in april  the eni business eni of emerson electric co 
in january  tenta technologies ltd 
tenta in march  ipc fab automation gmbh ipc in april and equipnet  ltd 
equipnet in october as a part of its business strategy  mks may enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions 
acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks  including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of mks ongoing business and distraction of management  expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses 
as a result of its recent acquisitions  the company has added several different decentralized accounting systems  resulting in a complex reporting environment 
the company expects that it will need to continue to modify its accounting policies  internal controls  procedures and compliance programs to provide consistency across all its operations 
if mks is not successful in completing acquisitions that it may pursue in the future  it may be required to reevaluate its growth strategy  and mks may have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources in seeking to complete proposed acquisitions that will not generate benefits for it 
in addition  with future acquisitions  mks could use substantial portions of its available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price 
mks could also issue additional securities as consideration for these acquisitions  which could cause significant stockholder dilution 
mks acquisitions of compact instrument  telvac  spectra  dip  astex  on line  eni  tenta  ipc  and equipnet and any future acquisitions may not ultimately help mks achieve its strategic goals and may pose other risks to mks 
an inability to convince semiconductor device manufacturers to specify the use of mks products to mks customers  who are semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers  would weaken mks competitive position 
the markets for mks products are highly competitive 
its competitive success often depends upon factors outside of its control 
for example  in some cases  particularly with respect to mass flow controllers  semiconductor device manufacturers may direct semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers to use a specified supplier s product in their equipment 
accordingly  for such products  mks success will depend in part on its ability to have semiconductor device manufacturers specify that mks products be used at their semiconductor fabrication facilities 
in addition  mks may encounter difficulties in changing established relationships of competitors that already have a large installed base of products within such semiconductor fabrication facilities 
if mks products are not designed into successive new generations of its customers products  mks will lose significant net sales during the lifespan of those products 
new products designed by semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers typically have a lifespan of five to ten years 
mks success depends on its products being designed into new generations of equipment for the semiconductor industry 
mks must develop products that are technologically current so that they are positioned to be chosen for use in each successive new generation of semiconductor capital equipment 
if mks products are not chosen by its customers  mks net sales may be reduced during the lifespan of its customers products 
in addition  mks must make a significant capital investment to develop products for its customers well before its products are introduced and before it can be sure that it will recover its capital investment through sales to the customers in significant volume 
mks is thus also at risk during the development phase that its products may fail to meet its customers technical or cost requirements and may be replaced by a competitive product or alternative technology solution 
if that happens  mks may be unable to recover mks development costs 
the semiconductor industry is subject to rapid demand shifts which are difficult to predict 
as a result  mks inability to expand its manufacturing capacity in response to these rapid shifts may cause a reduction in its market share 
mks ability to increase sales of certain products depends in part upon its ability to expand its manufacturing capacity for such products in a timely manner 
if mks is unable to expand its manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or to manage such expansion effectively  its customers could implement its competitors products and  as a result  its market share could be reduced 
because the semiconductor industry is subject to rapid demand shifts which are difficult to foresee  mks may not be able to increase capacity quickly enough to respond to a rapid increase in demand in the semiconductor industry 
additionally  capacity expansion could increase mks fixed operating expenses and if sales levels do not increase to offset the additional expense levels associated with any such expansion  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
sales to foreign markets constitute a substantial portion of mks net sales  therefore  mks net sales and results of operations could be adversely affected by downturns in economic conditions in countries outside of the united states 
international sales include sales by mks foreign subsidiaries  but exclude direct export sales  which were less than of mks total net sales for each of the years ended december   and international sales accounted for approximately of net sales in  of net sales in and of net sales in mks anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of mks net sales 
in addition  certain of mks key domestic customers derive a significant portion of their revenues from sales in international markets 
therefore  mks sales and results of operations could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns and other risks associated with international sales 
risks relating to mks international operations could adversely affect mks operating results 
mks has substantial international sales  service and manufacturing operations in europe and asia  which exposes mks to foreign operational and political risks that may harm mks business 
mks international operations are subject to inherent risks  which may adversely affect mks  including political and economic instability in countries where mks has sales  service and manufacturing operations  particularly in asia  fluctuations in the value of currencies and high levels of inflation  particularly in asia and europe  changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  including  but not limited to  labor unions  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles  burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws  increases in duties and taxation  imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds  changes in export duties and limitations on imports or exports  expropriation of private enterprises  and unexpected changes in foreign regulations 
if any of these risks materialize  mks operating results may be adversely affected 
unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations may lead to lower gross margins  or may cause mks to raise prices which could result in reduced sales 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on mks net sales and results of operations and mks could experience losses with respect to its hedging activities 
unfavorable currency fluctuations could require mks to increase prices to foreign customers which could result in lower net sales by mks to such customers 
alternatively  if mks does not adjust the prices for its products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  sales made by mks foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold and the currency it receives in payment for such sales could be less valuable at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations 
mks enters into forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options to reduce currency exposure arising from intercompany sales of inventory 
however  mks cannot be certain that its efforts will be adequate to protect it against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose it to additional exchange rate risks 
key personnel may be difficult to attract and retain 
mks success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of a number of key employees and officers  particularly those with expertise in the semiconductor manufacturing and similar industrial manufacturing industries 
the loss of key employees or officers could have a material adverse effect on mks business  financial condition and results of operations 
mks believes that its future success will depend in part on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  financial  managerial and marketing personnel 
mks cannot be certain that it will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
mks proprietary technology is important to the continued success of its business 
mks failure to protect this proprietary technology may significantly impair mks competitive position 
as of december   mks owned us patents and foreign patents and had pending us patent applications and pending foreign patent applications 
although mks seeks to protect its intellectual property rights through patents  copyrights  trade secrets and other measures  it cannot be certain that mks will be able to protect its technology adequately  competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently  any of mks pending patent applications will be issued  intellectual property laws will protect mks intellectual property rights  or third parties will not assert that mks products infringe patent  copyright or trade secrets of such parties 
protection of mks intellectual property rights may result in costly litigation 
litigation may be necessary in order to enforce mks patents  copyrights or other intellectual property rights  to protect its trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement 
for example  on november   on line technologies inc  which was acquired by mks in april  brought suit in federal district court in connecticut against perkin elmer  inc and certain other defendants for infringement of on line s patent related to its ftir spectrometer product 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on mks business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market price of mks common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate for reasons over which mks has no control 
the stock market has from time to time experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  extreme price and volume fluctuations 
recently  prices of securities of technology companies have been especially volatile and have often fluctuated for reasons that are unrelated to the operating performance of the companies 
the market price of shares of mks common stock has fluctuated greatly since its initial public offering and could continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation 
if mks were the object of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of mks management s attention and resources 
mks dependence on sole  limited source suppliers  and international suppliers  could affect its ability to manufacture products and systems 
mks relies on sole  limited source suppliers  and international suppliers  for a few of its components and subassemblies that are critical to the manufacturing of mks products 
this reliance involves several risks  including the following the potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of components  and the potential inability of its suppliers to develop technologically advanced products to support mks growth and development of new systems 
mks believes that in time mks could obtain and qualify alternative sources for most sole  limited source and international supplier parts 
seeking alternative sources of the parts could require mks to redesign its systems  resulting in increased costs and likely shipping delays 
mks may be unable to redesign its systems  which could result in further costs and shipping delays 
these increased costs would decrease mks profit margins if it could not pass the costs to its customers 
further  shipping delays could damage mks relationships with current and potential customers and have a material adverse effect on mks business and results of operations 
mks is subject to governmental regulations 
mks is subject to federal  state  local and foreign regulations  including environmental regulations and regulations relating to the design and operation of mks power supply products 
mks must ensure that these systems meet certain safety standards  many of which vary across the countries in which mks systems are used 
for example  the european union has published directives specifically relating to power supplies 
mks must comply with these directives in order to ship mks systems into countries that are members of the european union 
mks believes it is in compliance with current applicable regulations  directives and standards and has obtained all necessary permits  approvals  and authorizations to conduct mks business 
however  compliance with future regulations  directives and standards could require it to modify or redesign certain systems  make capital expenditures or incur substantial costs 
if mks does not comply with current or future regulations  directives and standards mks could be subject to fines  mks production could be suspended  or mks could be prohibited from offering particular systems in specified markets 
certain stockholders have a substantial interest in mks and may be able to exert substantial influence over mks actions 
as of january   john r 
bertucci  president  chairman and chief executive officer of mks  and certain members of his family  in the aggregate  beneficially owned approximately of mks outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  are able to exert substantial influence over the actions of mks 
pursuant to the acquisition of the eni business of emerson electric co 
emerson  mks issued approximately  shares of common stock to emerson 
as of january   emerson beneficially owned approximately of mks outstanding common stock  and accordingly  emerson is able to exert substantial influence over mks actions 
some provisions of mks restated articles of organization  as amended  mks amended and restated by laws and massachusetts law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of mks 
anti takeover provisions could diminish the opportunities for stockholders to participate in tender offers  including tender offers at a price above the then current market value of the common stock 
such provisions may also inhibit increases in the market price of the common stock that could result from takeover attempts 
for example  while mks has no present plans to issue any preferred stock  mks board of directors  without further stockholder approval  may issue preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of mks 
the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of mks common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
in addition  mks amended and restated by laws provide for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes 
the classified board could also have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of mks
