critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and have identified revenue recognition  the valuation of accounts receivable  the capitalization of product development costs and the valuation of our deferred tax asset as the critical accounting policies that are significant to the financial statement presentation and require difficult  subjective and complex judgments 

table of contents plato learning  inc management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition dollars in thousands  except per share amounts critical accounting policies  continued see note to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on these and other accounting policies and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the most significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether there are any significant uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and whether collectibility can be considered probable 
in addition  our transactions often consist of multiple element arrangements which must be analyzed to determine the relative fair value of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts we determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectibility of specific accounts  historical experience and the aging of the accounts receivable 
bad debt expense is recorded as an operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
the assumptions and estimates used to determine the allowance are subject to constant revision 
the primary factors that impact these assumptions include the efficiency and effectiveness of our billing and collection functions and our credit assessment process 
actual collection results could differ materially from those estimated and have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
capitalization of product development costs our product development expense includes costs related to the development  enhancement and maintenance of our courseware products  and the effect of product development cost capitalization and amortization 
research and development costs  relating principally to the design and development of new products  and the routine enhancement of existing products are expensed as incurred 
we capitalize product development costs when the projects under development reach technological feasibility  as defined by the accounting standards 
capitalization ends when a product is available for general release to our customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
we amortize these costs using the greater of a the amount determined by the ratio of the product s current revenue to total expected future revenue  or b the straight line 
table of contents plato learning  inc management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition dollars in thousands  except per share amounts critical accounting policies  continued capitalization of product development costs  continued method over the estimated useful life of the product 
during all periods presented  we used the straight line method to amortize the capitalized costs  generally over three years 
the most significant judgments regarding capitalization of product development costs typically involve the determination of whether development efforts should be expensed or have reached technological feasibility and can be capitalized  and the recoverability of capitalized costs 
we continually evaluate our capitalized costs to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product exceeds the estimated net realizable value of that product 
estimating net realizable value requires us to estimate future cash flows to be generated by the product and to use judgment in quantifying the amount  if any  to be written off 
actual cash flows and amounts realized from the courseware products could differ materially from those estimated 
in addition  any future changes to our courseware product offerings could result in write offs of previously capitalized costs and have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
deferred income tax asset we account for deferred income taxes based upon differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
the measurement of the deferred tax asset is adjusted by a valuation allowance  if necessary  to recognize the extent to which the future tax benefits will be recognized 
at october  we had a net deferred tax asset of  this deferred tax asset is net of a valuation allowance related to a foreign net operating loss carryforward 
a substantial portion of the deferred tax asset relates to our net operating loss carryforward in the united states 
we have recorded the net deferred tax asset as we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the asset through generation of future taxable income in the united states 
we base this belief upon the levels of taxable income generated historically as well as projections of future taxable income 
if future levels of taxable income in the united states are not consistent with our expectations  we may be required to record a valuation allowance  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we also have net operating loss carryforwards related to our foreign subsidiaries 
we have provided a full valuation allowance related to these deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty in realization of future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions 

table of contents plato learning  inc management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition dollars in thousands  except per share amounts critical accounting policies  continued goodwill and identified intangible assets we record our acquisitions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
we allocate the cost of acquired companies to the tangible and identified intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology  are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives  while in process research and development  if any  is recorded as a one time charge at the acquisition date 
most of the companies we acquire do not have significant tangible assets and  as a result  the majority of the purchase price is typically allocated to identified intangible assets or goodwill  which increases future amortization expense and the potential for impairment charges that we may incur 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets may have a significant impact on our future operating results 
in addition  the allocation of the purchase price requires that we make significant assumptions and estimates  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
should different conditions prevail  we may have to record impairment charges  which may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  as required  for all business combinations completed after june  sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations 
all of our acquisitions  including those prior to the adoption of sfas  were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at their estimated fair values on the dates of acquisition 
operating results of the acquired companies were included in our consolidated financial statements from the dates of acquisition 
additionally in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized and must be periodically reviewed for impairment 
if such review indicates that the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to that excess amount 
there were no such impairments of goodwill and identified intangible assets during the periods presented
