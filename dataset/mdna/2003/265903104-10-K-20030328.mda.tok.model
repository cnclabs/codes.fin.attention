see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the applicable assets  liabilities and results of operations related to the mechanical assemblies europe business  including the related charges  have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements  and prior periods have been recast to present mechanical assemblies europe as a discontinued operation in all periods presented 
overview the economic climate throughout remained challenging as the benefits from higher production volumes in the north american automotive and recreation vehicle industries were partially offset by weakness in europe 
the oems continued to offer various incentive plans including zero percent financing throughout the year 
we anticipate that will continue to be a challenging environment and we believe that our ability to reduce costs and deliver quality products has prepared us for the conditions this uncertain market may present to us 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or percent  to  million from  million for factors that favorably impacted revenue in included an increase in the north american automotive and recreation vehicle production volumes  the strengthening of the european currencies in relation to the us dollar and an increase in new business in dura s core products 
slightly offsetting these favorable items was the impact of dura s divestiture actions  continued weakness in european volumes and the impact of strategically exiting certain of dura s low margin non core businesses in europe

income from continuing operations for the year ended december  increased by million  or percent  to million from million in the increase is primarily due to an increase in revenues and decreases in both amortization expense and interest expense  as described above 
these increases to income from continuing operations were offset by an increase in the provision for income taxes  also described above 
discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of  dura adopted a plan to divest its mechanical assemblies europe business  as it believes this business will not assist dura in reaching its strategic growth and profitability targets for the future 
the mechanical assemblies europe business generated annualized revenues of approximately million from facilities in grenoble and boynes  france  and woodley  nottingham and stourport  uk 
the mechanical assemblies europe divestiture was treated as a discontinued operation under sfas no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with that decision  dura recorded a loss from the mechanical assemblies europe business of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  of which approximately million is cash related 
including the previously disclosed and reported divestiture of the steering gear product line in the second quarter of and exit of the european pedal product line in the third quarter of  the total loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was million  on which no tax benefit was recorded 
these losses relate primarily to asset write downs of million  contractual commitments and transaction related costs of million  and year to date operating losses of million

comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  decreased by million  or percent  to  million from  million for factors that unfavorably impacted revenue in included the weakness in both the north american automotive and recreation vehicle markets as well as the weakening of the european currencies in relation to the us dollar 
approximately percent of dura s total revenues are generated from european operations and percent of total revenues are generated from the recreation vehicle market 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for the year ended december  decreased by million  or percent  to  million from  million for cost of sales as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  was percent compared to percent for the corresponding reduction in gross margin is primarily the result of the decreased volumes in the north american automotive and recreation vehicle markets as well as inefficiencies resulting from difficult product launches in europe 
these items were partially offset by the benefit from the implementation of dura s restructuring plan and continued focus on cost reduction 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased by million  or percent  to million from million in as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to percent for compared to percent for the decrease in cost is primarily the result of the salaried headcount reduction actions taken in late and early facility consolidation  product recall and other charges 
in november  dura entered into a definitive agreement to divest its plastic products business for total proceeds of approximately million 
the transaction closed on january  the plastic products business designed  engineered  and manufactured plastic components for a wide variety of automotive vehicle applications  focusing on the metal to plastic conversion and dual plastic applications markets 
this business employed approximately people in three facilities located in mishawaka  indiana  bowling green  kentucky  and jonesville  michigan and generated approximately million in annual revenue 
two members of dura s board of directors are members of management of an investor group which is general partner of the controlling shareholder of the acquiring company 
dura recorded a noncash charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of for the estimated loss upon divestment 
in the second quarter of  dura recorded an additional million charge related to final negotiation of purchase price adjustments 
in october  dura successfully completed the sale of its thixotech business located in canada for total proceeds of approximately million 
thixotech generated approximately million of revenue on an annualized basis  and is a manufacturer of magnesium injection molded products for the electronics  communications  power tools and automotive industries 
dura recorded a noncash charge related to this transaction of approximately million in the fourth quarter of in august  dura divested its australian operations resulting in a charge of approximately million in the third quarter of approximately million of this charge was cash related 
the australian operations generated approximately million of revenue on an annualized basis and produced parking brakes  jacks  pedal assemblies  hinges and latches for the automotive industry 
throughout and dura has evaluated manufacturing capacity issues and opportunities for cost reduction given the reduced demand in the north america automotive and recreation vehicle markets and the available capacity within dura s operations 
as a result  beginning in the fourth quarter of  dura began to implement several actions including discontinuing operations in two north american facilities  combining the driver control and engineered products divisions into one control systems  and reducing and consolidating certain support activities to achieve an appropriate level of support personnel relative to remaining operations and future business requirements 
these actions resulted in a fourth quarter restructuring charge of million  including severance related payments of million and facility closure costs of approximately million 
additionally in  dura expensed as incurred equipment relocation costs of million 
in continuation of the actions taken in  dura recorded million of additional restructuring charges in the first quarter and million in the fourth quarter of relating to employee severance 
dura also expensed as incurred approximately million of equipment relocation costs incurred during the first quarter of the effect of the costs expensed as incurred are reflected as facility consolidation and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
costs incurred and charged to the reserves as of december  amounted to million in severance related costs and million in facility closure costs 
during and  additional adjustments were made of million and million  respectively  to decrease the reserve for employee severance as the actual costs incurred were less than originally estimated 
the decision to exit the two facilities resulted in a reduction in the work force of approximately salaried and hourly employees  all of which have been let go as of december  additionally  the decision to consolidate two divisions into one and to reduce support personnel to a level consistent with future business requirements resulted in a reduction of approximately salaried employees  all of which have been let go as of december  amortization expense 
amortization expense for the year ended december  decreased by million  or percent  to million from million in the slight decrease is due to the impact of foreign exchange on european goodwill during interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million  or percent  to million from million in the decrease in interest expense is due to lower interest rates on libor contracts and debt pay down of approximately million during  offset by the higher interest cost related to the additional issuance of million of subordinated notes and the unfavorable impact of existing interest rate swap agreements 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was percent compared to the effective tax rate of percent 
the effective income tax rate decreased as a result of the implementation of tax planning strategies during  a reduction in the statutory tax rates in germany that became effective in and a tax holiday in the czech republic for the effective rate differs from statutory rates due primarily to the mix of income loss among the countries in which dura operates  the effect of non deductible goodwill amortization and the effects of various tax planning strategies 
minority interest 
minority interest for the years ended december  and december  represents dividends  net of income tax benefits  on the preferred securities which were issued on march  income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations for the year ended december  decreased by million  or percent  to million from million in the decrease is primarily due to decreases in revenues and gross margin  as described above 
these decreases to income from continuing operations were offset by decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses  interest expense and the provision for income taxes  also described above 
discontinued operations 
income loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  decreased by million to a loss of million  from income of million in the decrease is due to lower volumes in these businesses and certain product warranty costs 
net income loss 
net income loss for the year ended december  decreased by million to million  from million in the decrease primarily relates to the decrease in income from continuing operations described above  as well as a decrease in income loss from discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources during  dura provided cash from operations of million  compared to million in cash generated from operations before changes in working capital items was million for compared to million for working capital generated cash of million in compared to million in this reduction in cash generated from working capital is primarily the result of the strengthening of the european currencies in relation to the us dollar 
net cash used in investing activities was million for as compared to million in net proceeds from the disposition of the plastic products business provided million and net capital expenditures totaled million for the capital expenditures were primarily for equipment and dedicated tooling purchases related to new or replacement programs 
this compares with net capital expenditures of million in the decrease is due to dura s continued focus on cash management 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million for compared with million in  principally for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness 
in march  dura entered into its credit agreement 
the credit agreement originally provided for revolving credit facilities of million  a million tranche a term loan  a million tranche b term loan  and a million interim term loan facility 
in april  dura completed the offering of its percent senior notes  due april the interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually beginning october  net proceeds from this offering of approximately million were used to repay the outstanding balance of the million tranche a term loan and a portion of the million tranche b term loan 
dura then replaced the remaining tranche b term loan with a million tranche c term loan 
in addition  the revolving credit facility was decreased to million 
borrowings under the tranche c term loan are based on libor and are due and payable in december with no early repayment penalties 
in conjunction with these transactions  dura obtained an amendment to the credit agreement to allow for the senior notes offering and to further adjust certain financial covenants 
dura also entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap notional amount of million with various financial institutions that more closely mirrors the cost of its bank debt see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the repayment of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement  dura wrote off debt issuance costs of approximately million  net of income taxes  during the second quarter of this write off is reflected as an extraordinary item in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  included in interest expense  net  in the consolidated statements of operations is approximately million  million and million of interest income earned on dura s cash balances in the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december   rates on borrowings under the credit agreement are based on libor and were percent 
the revolving credit facility is available until march the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants which limit indebtedness  investments  rental obligations  and cash dividends 
the credit agreement also requires dura to maintain certain financial ratios including minimum liquidity and interest coverage 
in conjunction with the decision to divest the mechanical assemblies europe business  dura obtained an amendment to its credit agreement and was in compliance with the covenants as of december  borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all assets of dura 
the credit agreement provides dura with the ability to denominate a portion of its revolving credit borrowings in foreign currencies up to an amount equal to million 
as of december   dura had no borrowings outstanding under the revolver 
dura also utilizes uncommitted overdraft facilities to satisfy the short term working capital requirements of its foreign subsidiaries 
at december   dura had million outstanding under its overdraft facilities 
at december   dura had overdraft facilities available from banks of approximately million 
at december   dura had unused borrowing capacity of approximately million of which million was available under its most restrictive debt covenant 
dura also utilizes uncommitted overdraft facilities to satisfy the short term working capital requirements of its foreign subsidiaries 
at december   dura had overdraft facilities outstanding of million  which is included in current maturities of long term debt on the balance sheet 
at december   dura had overdraft facilities available from banks of approximately million 
the average interest rates on the outstanding overdraft facilities at december  was approximately percent 
in april  dura completed the offering of its subordinated notes  due may the interest on the subordinated notes is payable semiannually 
net proceeds from this offering of approximately million were used to repay the million interim term loan  approximately million to retire other indebtedness  and approximately million was used for general corporate purposes 
in june  dura completed a similar offering of percent senior subordinated notes due may with a face amount of million 
the interest on these notes is also payable semiannually 
unamortized discount and debt issuance costs were approximately million  yielding an imputed interest rate of percent 
net proceeds of approximately million were used to reduce the borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
these notes are collateralized by guarantees of certain of dura s subsidiaries 
dura is limited as to its ability to declare or make certain dividend payments or other distributions of assets under its credit agreement and subordinated notes 
certain distributions relating to items such as  a company stock purchase program  tax sharing arrangements and as required under dura s preferred securities are permitted 
dura s principal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations and borrowings under its million revolving credit facilities 
dura believes that such funds will be sufficient to its liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
dura s principal use of liquidity will be to meet debt service requirements  finance capital expenditures and to provide working capital availability 
dura expects that capital expenditures in will be approximately million 
these capital expenditures will be used primarily for equipment and dedicated tooling purchases and facility improvements 
dura s ability to service its indebtedness will depend on its future performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  regulatory and other factors 
certain of these factors are beyond dura s control 
dura believes that  based upon current levels of operations  it will be able to meet its debt service obligations when due 
significant assumptions underlie this belief  including  among other things  that dura will continue to be successful in implementing its business strategy and that there will be no material adverse developments in its business  liquidity or capital requirements 
if dura cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness and to meet its other obligations and commitments  dura might be required to refinance its debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose 
there is no assurance that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all  or would be permitted by the terms of the credit agreement 
in the event that dura is unable to refinance the credit agreement or raise funds through asset sales  sales of equity or otherwise  its ability to pay principal of  and interest on  its debt would be impaired 
subsequent event in march  dura completed the divestiture of its mechanical assemblies europe business to magal engineering and members of the local management group  located in woodley  england 
the divestiture was part of dura s strategic repositioning to focus dura on businesses that meet its future growth and profitability targets 
the european mechanical assemblies business employs approximately people at facilities located in grenoble and boynes  france  and woodley  nottingham and stourport  uk 
the european mechanical assemblies business generated annualized revenues of approximately million 
contractual obligations the following table presents dura s contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period less than one three three five more than total one year years years five years long term debt      senior notes   subordinated notes   capital lease obligations and other noncurrent liabilities   mandatorily redeemable convertible trust preferred securities   operating leases      total      significant accounting policies dura s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of dura s accounting policies require the application of significant judgement by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
revenue recognition and sales commitments 
dura recognizes revenue as its products are shipped to its customers 
dura enters into agreements with its customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s life to produce products 
once such agreements are entered into by dura  fulfillment of the customers purchasing requirements is the obligation of dura for the entire production life of the vehicle  with terms of up to seven years  and dura has no provisions to terminate such contracts 
in certain instances  dura may be committed under existing agreements to supply product to its customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such product 
in such situations  dura records a liability for the estimated future amount of such losses 
such losses are recognized at the time that the loss is probable and reasonably estimable and is recorded at the minimum amount necessary to fulfill dura s obligations to its customers 
valuation of goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired  and  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was amortized over years 
effective january   goodwill is no longer amortized  but is instead subjected to annual impairment testing in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
other assets principally consist of pension plan assets in excess of accumulated benefits  debt financing costs  which are being amortized over the term of the applicable agreements  and deferred income taxes 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 dura completed step one of the transitional goodwill impairment test  using a combination of valuation techniques  including the discounted cash flow approach and the market multiple approach  for each of its four reporting units control systems  body glass  mobile products and other operating companies 
the information obtained by dura as part of its market multiple based approach was based upon externally sourced information 
the discounted cash flow technique involves the use of two key assumptions estimated future income and resulting cash flows and an estimated discount rate  both of which are highly subjective and likely to change in the future 
both of these methods use estimates which may change in the future and  if such changes are adverse  could impact the recorded value of goodwill on dura s consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  dura may be required to record a non cash charge to operations for goodwill impairment in the future  which could adversely affect reported earnings and  consequently  its stockholders investment 
upon completion of the required assessments under sfas no 
 it was determined that the fair market value of the goodwill assigned to its control systems and other operating companies reporting units was lower than its book value  resulting in a transitional impairment charge of approximately million  representing the write off of percent of the control systems reporting unit goodwill and percent of the other operating companies reporting unit goodwill 
the write off was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in dura s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in the case of body glass and mobile products  the difference between the net asset value  including goodwill  and the fair value is large  in the case of control systems  as a result of the impairment charge taken  it was equal to the estimated fair value on january  as a result  specific adverse changes in assumptions would not necessarily result in goodwill impairment charges across all reporting units equally 
for example  if the market multiple used at january  would have been times lower independent of all other factors  it would have resulted in an additional charge to goodwill related to the control systems reporting unit of approximately million 
the fair value of body glass and mobile products would still have been in excess of their recorded book values 
if an impairment would have been indicated  such amount would be preliminary  since upon identifying any possible impairment charge  dura would then be required to perform a secondary step to determine the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the applicable reporting unit in order to determine the actual impairment  if any 
similar differences would result with respect to changes in the discount rate or cash flow assumptions used in the discounted cash flow approach 
if the market multiple  discount rate or estimated future cash flows were to change favorably  there would be no resulting impairment charge 
in addition  dura operates in the vehicle component supply industry  which has recently experienced an economic downturn 
the failure of this industry to rebound and or dura s failure to maintain or improve sales and operating results could result in future goodwill impairment charges 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements dura is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves dura estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within dura s consolidated balance sheet 
dura must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  dura must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent dura establishes a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  it must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining dura s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
dura has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred tax assets  primarily certain net operating loss carryovers before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on dura s estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which it operates and the period over which its deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or dura adjust these estimates in future periods  the effects of these adjustments could materially impact dura s financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
defined benefit plans and post retirement benefits 
dura sponsors defined benefit plans that cover certain hourly and salaried employees in the united states and certain european countries 
dura s policy is to make annual contributions to the plans to fund the normal cost as required by local regulations 
in addition  dura has nine postretirement medical benefit plans for certain employee groups and has recorded a liability for its estimated obligation under these plans 
in calculating obligation and expense  dura is required to select certain actuarial assumptions  as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these assumptions include discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
dura s assumptions are determined based on current market conditions  historical information and consultation with and input from its actuaries 
dura has historically used september as its annual measurement date 
for  dura assumed a discount rate of to percent for its pension benefits  and percent for its post retirement benefits other than pensions 
holding other variables constant such as expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase  a one percentage point increase in the discount rate related to dura s most significant plans would have increased dura s expense by million and obligations by million 
while any negative impact of these critical accounting policies would generally result in non cash charges to earnings  the severity of any charge and its impact on stockholders investment could adversely affect dura s borrowing agreements  cost of capital and ability to raise external capital 
dura s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of its board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed its disclosure in this management discussion and analysis 
quarterly results of operations and seasonality dura typically experiences decreased revenues and operating income during the third calendar quarter of each year due to production shutdowns at oems for model changeovers and vacations 
the recreation vehicle market is seasonal in that sales in the fourth quarter are normally at reduced levels 
effects of inflation inflation potentially affects dura in two principal ways 
first  a significant portion of dura s debt is tied to prevailing short term interest rates which may change as a result of inflation rates  translating into changes in interest expense 
second  general inflation can impact material purchases  labor and other costs 
in many cases  dura has limited ability to pass through inflation related cost increases due to the competitive nature of the markets that dura serves 
in the past few years  however  inflation has not been a significant factor 
market risk dura is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
dura does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
dura enters into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
dura manages its interest rate risk by balancing the amount of fixed and variable debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   giving effect to the interest rate swaps discussed below  dura had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair market value of dura s debt at december  by approximately million  million of which relates to dura s interest rate swap agreements see below  and would be expected to have an estimated impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next year of approximately million 
at december   dura had outstanding interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted million of its senior notes into floating rate obligations
