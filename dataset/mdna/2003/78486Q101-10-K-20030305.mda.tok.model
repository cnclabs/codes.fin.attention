certain reclassifications have been made to our prior years results to conform to presentations 
such reclassifications had no effect on our results of operations or stockholders equity 
critical accounting policies marketable equity securities investments in marketable equity securities include warrants for shares of publicly traded companies and investments in shares of publicly traded companies 
equity securities in our warrant  direct equity  and venture capital fund portfolios generally become marketable when a portfolio company completes an initial public offering on a publicly reported market  or is acquired by a publicly traded company 
our merchant banking marketable warrant and equity securities totaled million at december  and million at december  marketable equity securities related to taurus  lp and libra  lp totaled approximately million  see item business acquisitions 
these instruments are classified as available for sale and are accounted for at fair value 
we recognized gains from the disposition of client warrants in our consolidated statements of income of million in  million in  and million in unrealized gains or losses on warrant and equity investment securities are recorded upon the establishment of a readily determinable fair value of the underlying security  as defined by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity instruments 
unrealized gains or losses after applicable taxes  on available for sale marketable equity securities that result from initial public offerings are excluded from earnings and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a separate component of stockholders equity 
unrealized losses on available for sale securities become realized and are charged against earnings when it is determined that an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
further  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis 
we are often contractually restricted from selling equity securities subsequent to the portfolio company s initial public offering 
gains or losses on these marketable equity instruments are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in the period the underlying securities are sold to a third party 
gains or losses on marketable warrant and equity investment securities that result from a portfolio company being acquired by a publicly traded company are marked to market when the acquisition occurs 
the resulting gains or losses are recognized into income on that date  in accordance with emerging issues task force  issue no 
 nonmonetary exchange of cost method investments 
further fluctuations in the market value of these marketable equity instruments  prior to eventual sale  are excluded from earnings and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is a separate component of stockholders equity 
upon the sale of these equity securities to a third party  gains and losses  which are measured from the acquisition price  are recognized in our consolidated statements of income 
notwithstanding the foregoing  a decline in the fair value of any of these securities that is considered other than temporary  is recorded in our consolidated statements of income in the period the impairment occurs 
we consider our marketable equity securities accounting policies to be critical  as the timing and amount of income  if any  from these instruments typically depend upon factors beyond our control 
these factors include the general condition of the public equity markets  levels of mergers and acquisitions activity  fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying common stock of these companies  and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities 
hence  the amount of income we realize from these equity instruments in future periods may vary materially from the current unrealized amount of million and are likely to vary materially from period to period 
non marketable equity securities we invest in non marketable equity securities in several ways through the exercise of warrants obtained in the normal course of lending by direct purchases of preferred or common stock in privately held companies by capital contributions to venture capital funds  which in turn  make investments in preferred or common stock of privately held companies through our venture capital fund  silicon valley bancventures  lp  which makes investments in preferred or common stock of privately held companies through our fund of funds  svb strategic investors fund  lp  which makes investments in venture capital funds  which in turn invest in privately held companies unexercised warrant securities are recorded at a nominal value on our consolidated balance sheets 
they are carried at this value until they become marketable or expire 
a summary of our accounting policies for other non marketable equity securities is presented in the following table 
a complete description of the accounting policies follows the table 
private equity and venture capital fund investments wholly owned by silicon cost basis less identified impairment  if any owned by silicon valley bancventures  lp and svb strategic investors fund  lp investment accounting  adjust to fair value on a quarterly basis through the statement of income non marketable venture capital fund investments and other direct private equity investments wholly owned by silicon totaled million at december  and million at december  excluding our ownership interest in our managed funds  svb strategic investors fund  lp and silicon valley bancventures  lp  which are described below 
we record these investments on a cost basis as our interests are considered minor because we own less than of the company and have no influence over the company s operating and financial policies 
our cost basis in each investment is reduced by returns until the cost basis of the individual investment is fully recovered 
returns in excess of the cost basis are recorded as investment gains in noninterest income 
the values of the investments are reviewed at least quarterly  giving consideration to the facts and circumstances of each individual investment 
management s review of private equity investments typically includes the relevant market conditions  offering prices  operating results  financial conditions  and exit strategies 
a decline in the fair value that is considered other than temporary is recorded in our consolidated statements of income in the period the impairment occurs 
any estimated loss is recorded in noninterest income as investment losses 
investments held by silicon valley bancventures  lp totaled million at december  and million at december  and are recorded at fair value using investment accounting rules 
the investments consist of stock in private companies that are not traded on a public market and are subject to restrictions on resale 
these investments are carried at estimated fair value as determined by the general partner 
the valuation generally remains at cost until such time that there is significant evidence of a change in values based upon consideration of the relevant market conditions  offering prices  operating results  financial conditions  exit strategies  and other pertinent information 
the general partner  silicon valley bancventures  inc is owned and controlled by silicon and has an ownership interest of in silicon valley bancventures  lp therefore  silicon valley bancventures  lp is fully consolidated and any gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in our consolidated statements of income 
the portion of any gains or losses belonging to the limited partners is reflected in minority interest and adjusts silicon s income to its percentage ownership 
the svb strategic investors fund  lp portfolio consists primarily of investments in venture capital funds 
these funds totaled million at december  and million at december   which are recorded at fair value using investment accounting rules 
the carrying value of the investments is determined by the general partner based on the percentage of svb strategic investors fund  lp s interest in the total fair market value as provided by each venture capital fund investment 
svb strategic investors  llc generally utilizes the fair values assigned to the underlying portfolio investments by the management of the venture capital funds 
the estimated fair value of the investments is determined after giving consideration to the relevant market conditions  offering prices  operating results  financial conditions  exit strategy  and other pertinent information 
the general partner  svb strategic investors  llc  is owned and controlled by silicon and has an ownership interest of in svb strategic investors fund  lp therefore  svb strategic investors fund  lp is fully consolidated and any gains or losses resulting from changes in the estimated fair value of the venture capital fund investments are recorded as investment gains or losses in our consolidated statements of income 
the limited partner s share of any gains or losses is reflected in minority interest and adjusts silicon s income to its percentage ownership

these factors include the general condition of the public equity markets  levels of mergers and acquisitions activity  and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities 
therefore  we cannot predict future gains or losses with any degree of accuracy and any gains or losses are likely to vary materially from period to period 
in addition  the valuation of non marketable equity securities included in our financial statements at december  represents our best interpretation of the underlying equity securities performance at this time 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations  the estimated values of these securities may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
allowance for loan losses we consider our accounting policy relating to the estimation of the allowance for loan losses to be critical as it involves material estimates by our management and is particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near term 
we define credit risk as the probability of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
through the administration of loan policies and monitoring of the loan portfolio  our management seeks to reduce such credit risks 
while we follow underwriting and credit monitoring procedures  which we believe are appropriate in growing and managing the loan portfolio  in the event of nonperformance by these other parties  our potential exposure to credit losses could significantly affect our consolidated financial position and earnings 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense to provide for credit risk 
our allowance for loan losses is established for loan losses not yet realized 
the process of anticipating loan losses is imprecise 
our management applies the following evaluation process to our loan portfolio to estimate the required allowance for loan losses 
we maintain a systematic process for the evaluation of individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan losses 
on a quarterly basis  each loan in our portfolio is assigned a credit risk rating 
credit risk ratings are assigned on a scale of to  with representing loans with a low risk of nonpayment  representing loans with the highest risk of nonpayment  and representing loans  which have been charged off 
this credit risk rating evaluation process includes  but is not limited to  consideration of such factors as payment status  the financial condition of the borrower  borrower compliance with loan covenants  underlying collateral values  potential loan concentrations  and general economic conditions 
our policies require a committee of senior management to review credit relationships that exceed specific dollar values  at least quarterly 
our review process evaluates the appropriateness of the credit risk rating and allocation of allowance for loan losses  as well as other account management functions 
in addition  our management receives and approves an analysis for all impaired loans  as defined by the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated based on a formula allocation for similarly risk rated loans  or for specific risk issues  which suggest a probable loss factor exceeding the formula allocation for a specific loan  or for individual impaired loans as determined by sfas no 
our evaluation process was designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we assess the risk of losses inherent in the loan portfolio by utilizing modeling techniques 
for this purpose  we have developed a statistical model based on historical loan loss migration to estimate an appropriate allowance for outstanding loan balances 
in addition  we apply macro and contingent allocations to the results of the aforementioned model to ascertain the total allowance for loan losses 
while this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information  the classification of loans and the establishment of the allowance for loan losses  relies  to a great extent  on the judgment and experience of our management 
historical loan loss migration model we use the historical loan loss migration model as a basis for determining expected loan loss factors by credit risk rating category 
the effectiveness of the historical loan loss migration model is predicated on the theory that historical trends are predictive of future experience 
specifically  the model calculates the likelihood and rate of a loan in one risk rating category moving one category lower using loan data from our portfolio 
we analyze the historical loan loss migration trend by compiling gross loan loss data and by credit risk rating for the four quarter period preceding the current period end 
each of the loans charged off over the four quarter period is assigned a credit risk rating at the period end of each of the preceding quarters 
on a quarter by quarter basis  the model calculates charged off loans as a percentage of current period end loans by credit risk rating category 
these percentages are weighted  based on the age of the data  and are aggregated to estimate our loan loss factors 
these expected loan loss factors are ultimately applied to the current period end aggregate outstanding loan balances to provide an estimation of the allowance for loan losses 
macro and contingent allocations additionally  we apply a contingent allocation to the results of this model 
our contingent allocation acknowledges that unfunded credit obligations can result in future losses 
unfunded credit obligations at each quarter end are allocated to credit risk rating categories in accordance with the client s credit risk rating 
we provide for the risk of loss on unfunded credit obligations by allocating fixed credit risk rating factors to our unfunded credit obligations 
a macro allocation is calculated each quarter based upon an assessment of the risks that may lead to a loan loss experience different from our historical results 
these risks are aggregated to become our macro allocation 
based on management s prediction or estimates of changing risks in the lending environment  the macro allocation may vary significantly from period to period and includes but is not limited to consideration of the following factors changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collections  charge off and recovery practices changes and development in national and local economic business conditions  including the market and economic condition of our clients industry sectors changes in the nature of our loan portfolio changes in experience  ability and depth of lending management and staff changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans changes in the trend of the volume of nonaccrual loans  troubled debt restructurings and other loan modifications finally  we compute several modified versions of the model  which provide additional assurance that the statistical results of the historical loan loss migration model are reasonable 
our chief credit officer and chief financial officer evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on the results of the historical loan loss migration model 
in addition to risk rating every loan in our portfolio  our management concluded that our allowance for loan and lease losses at december  was appropriate in consideration of the following factors a decreased risk of severe future losses from the early stage product loan portfolio a decreased risk of loan losses resulting from client instigated corporate fraud  due to the enforcement of recent government corporate governance regulations an increase of million in our average loan balance between september  and december  a continued weakness in the us economy a declining venture capital fund investment into our clients in our core industry sectors a continued volatility in global stock markets indices we consider our allowance for loan losses at december  to be adequate but not excessive and to be our best estimate using the historical loan loss experience and our perception of variables potentially leading to deviation from the historical loss experience 
goodwill as discussed in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data note to the consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets on january  under this standard  we are required to test intangible assets identified as having an indefinite useful life for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
in substantially all of our goodwill pertains to the acquisition of alliant partners  discussed in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data note to the consolidated financial statements business combinations 
in accordance with the provision of sfas no 
 the goodwill balance was determined to be unamortizable 
we completed our initial test for goodwill impairment in july  the result of which concluded that the goodwill balance was not impaired 
at december   our goodwill totaled million 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  sfas requires us to allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of those reporting units to which goodwill relates  and determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units 
furthermore  if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular reporting unit  then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
only after this process is completed is the amount of goodwill impairment determined 
accordingly  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the businesses with recognized goodwill for the purposes of our financial statements at december   we applied the fair value test using discounted estimated net cash flows 
our cash flow forecasts were based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
based on our best estimates  we have concluded that there is no impairment of our goodwill 
however  changes in these estimates could cause the businesses to be valued differently 
if alliant does not meet projected operating results  then this analysis could potentially result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge  depending on the estimated value of the alliant business unit and the value of the other assets and liabilities attributed to the business 
senior management discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of the aforementioned critical accounting policies with our audit committee on january  results of operations earnings summary we reported net income in of million  as compared to the net income of million in and million in diluted earnings per common share totaled in  as compared to in  and in return on average equity in was  as compared to in  and in return on average assets was in  as to in  and in the decrease in net income for  as compared to  resulted primarily from a decline in net interest income  partially offset by decreases in both provision for loan losses and income tax expense 
the decrease in net interest income was caused by a basis points decline in the average prime rate from in to in the decrease in net income for as compared to  was primarily attributable to decline in both net interest income and noninterest income  partially offset by decreases in both provision for loan losses and income tax expense

in  we implemented numerous measures to minimize the impact of the decline in market interest rates 
these measures included diversifying the product mix in the investment portfolio to higher yielding  high quality assets  reducing rates paid on interest bearing deposits  and embedding minimum interest rate floors into client loan agreements 
we also increased the average expected life of investments in our portfolio by replacing some assets from lower yielding short term securities to higher yielding longer term securities  thereby taking advantage of the steeper interest rate curve 
overall  the expected average life of portfolio investments increased to approximately years  as compared to less than year in the million decrease in interest income for  as compared to  was the result of a million unfavorable volume variance  combined with a million unfavorable rate variance 
the million unfavorable volume variance resulted from a million  or  decrease in average interest earning assets over the comparable prior year period 
the decrease in average interest earning assets was primarily concentrated in highly liquid federal funds sold  and securities purchased under agreement to resell  which decreased million  and investment securities  which decreased million 
these decreases were partially offset by million increase in loans 
average loans increased million  or  in  as compared to  resulting in an million favorable volume variance 
at december   we grew our loan portfolio to a record level by refocusing on attracting middle market and mature corporate technology and life sciences clients  which we believe are currently under served by competitors exiting these industry sectors 
we experienced loan growth across most of the industry sectors we serve 
additionally  our new loans continue to be subject to our standard underwriting practices 
we expect further growth in our loan balances to bolster our net interest margin since it will shift liquid interest earning assets from our investment portfolio  which currently yields  to loans with yields ranging from approximately to 
average investment securities for decreased million  or  as compared to  resulting in a million unfavorable volume variance 
the decrease in average investment securities was primarily centered in us agency securities  which decreased million 
this decrease resulted from declines in our average deposit balances and our common stock repurchase programs 
deposit balances declined in as our clients continued to experience reduced liquidity due to the slowdown in the capital markets and lower levels of venture capital fund investment 
however  quarterly average deposit balances stabilized during average federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell in decreased million  or  as compared to the prior year  resulting in an million unfavorable volume variance 
this decline was primarily due to a change in the investment portfolio mix  as funds were invested in longer term  high quality securities while still maintaining high levels of liquidity 
we expect to continue the trend of managing federal funds and overnight repurchase agreements at appropriate levels 
unfavorable rate variances associated with each component of interest earning assets caused a million decline in our interest income for as compared to short term market interest rates decreased rapidly throughout  and we experienced additional  although less severe  market interest rate decreases in thus  we earned lower yields in on federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell  as well as our investment securities  a significant portion of which were short term in nature 
the decrease in short term market interest rates resulted in a combined million unfavorable rate variance in  as compared to in  we incurred a million unfavorable rate variance associated with our loan portfolio 
the average yield on loans in decreased basis points to from in the prior year 
this was due to two factors 
first  the lower average prime rate reduced yields on floating rate loans  which represent approximately of our total loan portfolio 
the weighted average prime rate declined basis points from in to in second  our fixed rate loans are priced by reference to us treasury securities 
during  the treasury yield curve moved lower and flattened 
thus  we earned lower yields on new  renewed  and refinanced fixed rate loans 
our investment and loan portfolios are extremely interest rate sensitive  and therefore we expect that any increase in short term interest rates will be incremental to our earnings 
the yield on average interest earning assets decreased basis points in from the prior year 
this decrease primarily resulted from a decline in short term market interest rates  thus  we earned lower yields on each component of our interest earning assets 
total interest expense in decreased million from this decrease was due to a favorable rate variance of million  combined with a favorable volume variance of million 
the favorable rate variance largely resulted from a reduction between and in the average rate paid on our time deposit product from to 
the average cost of funds paid on average interest bearing liabilities in was down from in this decrease in the average cost of funds was largely due to a decrease of basis points in the average rate paid on our time deposit product 
compared to net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  totaled million in  a decrease of million  or  from the million in the decrease in net interest income was due to an million  or  decline in interest income  which was offset by a million  or  decrease in interest expense over the comparable prior year period 
the million decrease in interest income for  as compared to  was the result of a million unfavorable volume variance  combined with a million unfavorable rate variance 
the million unfavorable volume variance resulted from an million  or  decrease in average interest earning assets over the comparable prior year period 
the decrease in average interest earning assets resulted primarily from lower investable funds as the result of a decline in our client deposits  which decreased million  or  from to the decrease in average interest earning assets was primarily concentrated in highly liquid  federal funds sold  and securities purchased under agreement to resell  which decreased million 
average loans increased million  or  in  as compared to  resulting in an million favorable volume variance 
although we continued to add high quality loans to our portfolio throughout  the slowdown in our clients capital markets and venture capital funding reduced those opportunities and impeded our ability to increase loan balances 
average investment securities for decreased million  or  as compared to  resulting in a million unfavorable volume variance 
the decrease in investment securities was primarily centered in us agency securities and resulted from a corresponding decrease in client deposits 
average federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell in decreased a combined million  or  as compared to the prior year  resulting in a million unfavorable volume variance 
this decrease was a result of a decline in investable funds related to the decline in our clients average deposit balances 
unfavorable rate variances associated with each component of interest earning assets combined to decrease interest income by million in  as compared to the prior year 
short term market interest rates decreased during the past year 
as a result  we earned lower yields during on federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell  and our investment securities  a significant portion of which were short term in nature  resulting in a combined million unfavorable rate variance  as compared to the prior year 
in  we incurred a million unfavorable rate variance associated with our loan portfolio 
the average yield on loans in decreased basis points to from in the prior year 
approximately of our loan balance was prime rated based at december   the majority of the remaining loan balance was fixed rate 
the yield on average interest earning assets decreased basis points in from the prior year 
this decrease primarily resulted from a decline in short term market rates  thus  we earned lower yields on each component of our interest earning assets 
total interest expense in decreased million  as compared to this decrease was due to a favorable rate variance of million  combined with a favorable volume variance of million 
the favorable rate variance largely resulted from a reduction  between and in the average rate paid on our bonus money market deposit product from to  and from to on our time deposit product 
the average cost of funds paid on average interest bearing liabilities in was down from in this decrease in the average cost of funds was largely due to a decrease of basis points in the average rate paid on our bonus money market deposit product and a basis point decrease on the average rate paid on our time deposit product 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is based on our evaluation of the adequacy of the existing allowance for loan losses in relation to total loans and on our periodic assessment of the inherent and identified risk dynamics of the loan portfolio resulting from reviews of selected individual loans and loan commitments 
our provision for loan losses totaled million in  as compared to million in  and million in we incurred net charge offs of million in  as compared to million in  and million in the decrease in provision for loan losses for  as compared to  resulted from million in recoveries in  relating in large part to loan loss recoveries from entertainment loan litigation settlements

noninterest income the following table summarizes the components of noninterest income for the past three years 
years ended december  dollars in thousands client investment fees    letter of credit and foreign exchange income   corporate finance fees    deposit service charges    disposition of client warrants    investment losses gains    other    total noninterest income    noninterest income decreased million  or  in  as compared to this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in client investment fees  a decrease of million in income from the disposition of client warrants  and a decrease of million in other noninterest income 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million in corporate finance fees  a million increase in deposit service charges  a million increase in letter of credit and foreign exchange income  and a million decrease in investment losses 
noninterest income decreased million  or in  as compared to this decrease was largely due to a million decrease in income from the disposition of client warrants  combined with a million decline in investment loss gain contribution 
client investment fees totaled million in  as compared to million in  and million in we offer private label investment and sweep products to clients on which we earn fees ranging from to basis points on the average balance of these products 
at december   billion in client funds were invested in these private label investment and sweep products  including billion in the mutual fund products  as compared to billion and billion  respectively  at december  the decrease in client investment fees of million was due to a combination of a shift in investment mix and a decline in our clients investment balances 
also  in the third quarter of  we completed an initiative of transferring the private label investment operations from silicon valley bank into a wholly owned  registered  broker dealer subsidiary of silicon valley bank 
this action will allow us to provide a more expansive and competitive array of investment products and service to our clients 
we believe this initiative will provide us additional future opportunities to compete for additional client funds and grow client private label investment balances 
letter of credit fees  foreign exchange fees  and other trade finance income totaled million in  an increase of million  or  from the million total in  and a decrease of million  or  from the million total in the increase between and reflects an increase in the number of products offered by us and an increase in the volume of client foreign exchange transactions during as compared to corporate finance fees totaled million in  an increase of million  or  from the million in  and an increase of million or  from the million total in in  alliant partners  our investment banking subsidiary  generated the entire balance of million 
svb securities  inc  generated million in and million in the increase in corporate finance fees was primarily due to the acquisition of alliant on september   which increased our mergers and acquisitions advisory activity 
alliant s revenues are typically a function of the valuation of their clients mergers and acquisitions transactions 
global political and economic events have depressed valuations of high technology and life sciences corporations 
consequently  alliant has not achieved the initial revenue goals we defined at the acquisition date 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data note to the consolidated financial statements business combinations 
however  alliant has met its targets for mergers and acquisitions transaction volumes for in the fourth quarter of  alliant s revenue showed improvement  as public equity markets improved slightly and alliant deal flow volume returned to a more normal pace 
we expect alliant revenues to continue to be volatile  but exhibit a general upward trend over the long term 
deposit service charges totaled million in  an increase of million  or  as compared to the million reported in  and an increase of million  or from the million in as we have expanded and enhanced our suite of fee based financial depository services and client usage has increased  overall service fees have increased year over year 
additionally  clients compensate us for depository services  either through earnings credits computed on their demand deposit balances  or through explicit payments recognized by us as deposit service charges income 
earnings credits are calculated using client average daily deposit balances  less a reserve requirement and a discounted us treasury bill interest rate 
clients received lower earnings credits in  as compared to due to lower average client deposit balances and lower market interest rates 
as such  our clients had fewer credits to offset explicit deposit service charges 
thus  we earned higher explicit deposit service charges in due to reduced client initial public offering and merger and acquisition activities  the income from disposition of client warrants totaled million in  as compared to million in and million in we have historically obtained rights to acquire stock  in the form of warrants  in certain clients  primarily as part of negotiated credit facilities 
the receipt of warrants does not change the loan covenants or other collateral control techniques we employ to mitigate the risk of a loan becoming nonperforming 
the collateral requirements on loans with warrants are similar to lending arrangements where warrants are not obtained 
the timing and amount of income from the disposition of client warrants typically depends upon factors beyond our control  including the general condition of the public equity markets as well as the merger and acquisition environment 
therefore  we cannot predict the timing and amount of income with any degree of accuracy  and this income is likely to vary materially from period to period 
we incurred million in losses on investment securities in  as compared to losses of million in  and gains of million in the and losses primarily related to the write down of certain venture capital fund and direct equity investments 
excluding the impact of minority interest  the net write downs of our equity securities for totaled approximately million and million for the gains primarily related to a gain of million realized on the sale of a venture capital fund investment  which completed its initial public offering in other noninterest income largely consisted of service based fee income  and totaled million in  as compared to million in and million in this decrease in  as compared to and  was primarily due to the elimination of supply chain service operations in late noninterest expense noninterest expense in totaled million  a million  or  increase from total noninterest expense was million in  a decrease of million  or  from we closely monitor our level of noninterest expense using a variety of financial ratios  including the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of adjusted noninterest expense by adjusted revenues 
noninterest expense is adjusted to exclude costs associated with amortization of investments in tax credit funds  minority interest  and retention and warrant incentive plans 
revenues are adjusted to exclude income associated with minority interest  the disposition of client warrants  and gains or losses related to investment securities 
this ratio reflects the level of operating expense required to generate of operating revenue

first  we completed a strategic realignment of some of our business activities  which resulted in severance expense of million in the second quarter of second  we incurred million in incentive compensation expense related to our target earnings levels being achieved in  as compared to in finally  average full time equivalent fte personnel increased from in to  in compensation and benefits expenses totaled million in  a million  or  decrease from the million incurred in this decrease was largely the result of a decrease in performance based compensation associated with our incentive bonuses and employee stock ownership plan 
average fte personnel increased from in to in the increase in fte personnel from through was primarily due to conversion of certain consultants to permanent employees status  the acquisition of alliant partners and woodside asset management  inc  and our efforts to build an infrastructure sufficient to support our business activities and regulatory requirements 
we are continuing our specific measures to control the number of fte personnel during due to the economic slowdown in our marketplace 
occupancy expense totaled million in  million in  and million in occupancy expense has generally increased over the past two years due to incremental costs associated with the addition of regional offices in the san francisco bay area  which were opened in the latter half of additionally  in  we exited leased premises  in santa clara  california  approximating  square feet 
the lease on the building expires in august our management determined that the premises would have no future economic value to our operations  except for any potential future sub lease arrangement 
therefore  during  we incurred charge offs of approximately million related to the exit of these premises 
professional services expenses  which consist of costs associated with corporate legal services  litigation settlements  accounting and auditing services  consulting  and our board of directors totaled million in  a million  or decrease from the million total in we incurred million in professional services expenses in the decrease in professional services is primarily related to a reduction in the number of business initiatives supported by consultants 
the increase in professional services expenses in  as compared to  reflects the extensive efforts we had undertaken to continue to build and support our infrastructure  as well as evaluate and pursue new business opportunities 
furniture  and equipment expenses totaled million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to the million in  and a decrease of million  or compared to the million in the decrease in furniture and equipment expenses in as compared to  was primarily due to a million charge off of software related to an abandoned project in the third quarter of the higher level of furniture and equipment expense in was primarily attributable to certain nonrecurring costs in connection with the expansion of our existing corporate headquarters facility during the fourth quarter of  the addition of new regional offices  and an increase in recurring expenses associated with our additional office space 
business development and travel expenses totaled million in  a decrease of million  or  as compared to the million total in we incurred million in business development and travel expenses in the decrease in costs associated with business development  and travel expense in as compared to  and in as compared to was primarily due to our efforts to control noninterest expense 
postage and supplies expenses totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
total telephone expenses were million in  million in  and million in the decrease in both postage and supplies expenses and telephone expenses between and reflects our efforts to control noninterest expense 
correspondent bank fees totaled million in  million in  and million in many of our correspondent banks provide earnings credits to offset bank fees we incur when using their services 
earnings credits are generally calculated using average daily deposit balances  less a reserve requirement and a short term market interest rate 
we received lower earnings credits in as compared to and  due to our maintaining lower average balances with our correspondent banks and lower market interest rates 
as such  we had fewer earnings credits to offset bank fees charges incurred by us 
thus  we incurred higher recognizable bank fees in as compared to and management made the decision to lower the average balances with correspondent banks because we were able to earn more on our funds by investing them than we would have saved by leaving these funds with the correspondent banks 
we issued million in cumulative trust preferred securities during the second quarter of trust preferred securities distributions totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the trust preferred securities pay a fixed rate quarterly distribution of and have a maximum maturity of years 
on june   we entered into a derivative agreement with a notional amount of million 
the agreement hedges against the risk of changes in fair value associated with our million of trust preferred securities 
the terms of the agreement provide for quarterly receipt of fixed rate and payment of london inter bank offer rate libor plus a spread  based on the million notional amount 
the derivative agreement provided a million decrease in trust preferred security distribution expense for we expect this hedge to provide a greater reduction of the cost of our trust preferred securities during the first half of however  the counterparty to the derivative agreement has the option to cancel the agreement in june should the derivative agreement be cancelled  we will evaluate whether additional hedging is warranted 
there is no assurance that a similar hedging opportunity will become available at that time 
advertising and promotion expenses totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in advertising and promotion expenses during and was primarily the result of our effort to control noninterest expense 
retention and warrant incentive plans expense totaled million in  million in  and million in under the provisions of the retention and warrant incentive plans  employees are compensated with a fixed percentage of gains realized on warrant and certain venture capital fund and direct equity investments 
in  certain employees terminated employment with us 
consequently  we reversed the portion of the retention plan accrual applicable to those employees 
since we did not record any significant amount of retention plan expense related to existing or new plans in  the reversal of the accrual caused a reduction in expense in the decrease in retention and warrant plans expense in as compared to  was directly related to the decline in warrant  venture capital fund  and direct equity investment gains recognized by us in those years 
other noninterest expenses  excluding the affect of tax credit fund investment amortization  totaled million in  million in  and million in the increase in other noninterest expenses in as compared to  was primarily attributable to higher insurance and data processing costs 
minority interests the minority interest limited partner s share of losses were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the minority interest limited partner losses were primarily due to a write down of minority interest owned investments associated with svb strategic investors fund  lp and silicon valley bancventures  lp of million and million in and  respectively 
minority interest limited partner losses in primarily related to fund management fees associated with svb strategic investors fund  lp and silicon valley bancventures  lp income taxes our effective income tax rate was in  compared to in and in the change in our effective income tax rate from to was primarily due to an increase in items giving rise to permanent tax benefits 
in particular  on september   california enacted a law requiring large banks those with average assets in excess of million to conform to federal law with respect to accounting for bad debts 
prior to the law change  all banks  regardless of size  were eligible to use the reserve method of accounting for bad debts which enabled them to take deductions for anticipated bad debt losses prior to the losses being incurred for california tax purposes 
with the change  large banks may now only deduct actual charge offs net of recoveries in determining their california taxable income 
banks that are required to conform to the new law must include in taxable income percent of their existing bad debt reserves as of the end of the prior tax year 
as a concession for requiring large banks to comply with the new law  recapture of the remaining percent of the reserve is waived thereby creating a permanent tax benefit 
our one time tax benefit resulting from the law change was million and has been reflected in our income tax expense for this change  while reducing income tax expense  also results in accelerated tax payments 
in august  we implemented a real estate investment trust reit to serve as a future funding vehicle 
in we obtained million in tax benefits from the reit structure 
the increase in tax rate from to was principally attributable to changes in our multi state income tax rate 
financial condition total assets remained fairly consistent between december  and december  at billion 
however  we experienced a shift in the composition of our assets  reflected by a million increase in net loans  offset by decreases in investment securities and federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell by million and million  respectively 
federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell totaled a combined million at december   a decrease of million  or as compared to million outstanding at the prior year end 
year over year federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell were virtually unchanged 
however  as stated previously  average balances were down significantly demonstrating the shift into longer term securities while maintaining high levels of liquidity

investment securities totaled billion at december   a decrease of million  or  from the december  balance of billion 
this decrease resulted from a reallocation of funds to loans and our common stock repurchase programs during the decrease in investment securities was primarily in us treasury and agency securities  short term obligations of states and political subdivisions  and money market mutual funds 
this was partially offset by an increase in collateralized mortgage obligations 
this shift represents a change in investment portfolio management as we become more active in measuring and managing our interest rate risk 
we have increased the expected average life of investments in our portfolio to approximately years in from under year in by adding higher yielding  highly liquid agency mortgage backed securities and other triple a rated securities 
the increase in venture capital fund investments of million between and was primarily due to additional investments made by our managed fund  svb strategic investors  lp during the year 
the change in the composition of investments was the result of current interest rate conditions 
investment securities totaled billion at december   a decrease of million  or  from the december  balance of billion 
this decrease resulted from a decline in investable funds as a result of a decline in our deposits during and primarily consisted of u

the decrease in collateralized mortgage obligations was primarily due to maturities and prepayments 
the increase in venture capital fund investments of million between and was primarily due to additional investments made by our managed fund  svb strategic investors  lp during the year 
the change in the composition of investments was the result of interest rate conditions at that time 
based on december  market valuations  we had potential pre tax warrant gains totaling million related to companies 
we are restricted from exercising many of these warrants 
as of december   we held  warrants in  companies  had made investments in venture capital funds  and had direct equity investments in companies  many of which are private 
we also had investments in venture capital funds through our fund of funds  svb strategic investors  lp and had direct equity investments in companies through our venture capital fund  silicon valley bancventures  lp we are typically contractually precluded from taking steps to secure the current unrealized gains associated with many of these equity instruments 
hence  the amount of income we realize from these equity instruments in future periods may vary materially from the current unrealized amount due to fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying common stock of these companies 
at december   money market mutual funds were the only investment securities held by us that were issued by a single party  excluding securities issued by the us government or by us government agencies and corporations  and which exceeded of our stockholders equity 
the following table provides the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on investment securities as of december   except for auction rate securities that use the next reset date as the maturity date 
the weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of available for sale securities  which are reported at fair value 
expected remaining maturities of callable us agency securities  mortgage backed securities  and collateralized mortgage obligations may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without penalties 
this is most apparent in mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations as contractual maturities are typically to years whereby expected average lives of these securities are between two and five years

this risk  known as prepayment risk  may result in these securities having longer or shorter average lives than that anticipated at the time of purchase 
as interest rates decline  prepayments generally tend to increase  causing the average expected remaining maturity to shorten 
conversely  as interest rates rise  prepayments tend to decrease causing the average expected remaining maturity to extend

the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses at december  decreased million from the decrease in the unallocated allowance between and  principally reflects our management s decision to provide an additional allocation of the allowance for loan losses for our early stage product loan portfolio 
no such specific allocation existed at december  early stage product loans represent approximately of our total loan portfolio and are defined by us as loans made to nonpublic  emerging growth  technology and life science companies that have not yet attained profitability 
we determined that an additional allocation of the allowance for loan losses was necessary as our early stage product loan portfolio experienced higher than normal annualized gross loan losses that ranged from approximately to during each of the last three fiscal quarters of therefore  our management established an additional allocation to specifically address potential loan losses from this portfolio

a substantial portion of the decrease in deposits during was concentrated in our noninterest bearing demand deposits  which decreased million  or  and bonus money market deposits  which decreased million or  from the prior year end

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management a key objective of asset liability management is to manage interest rate risk associated with changing asset and liability cash flows and market interest rate movements 
interest rate risk occurs when interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities do not re price simultaneously both in timing and volume 
our asset liability committee alco provides oversight to our interest rate risk management process and recommends policy guidelines regarding exposure to interest rates for approval by our board of directors 
adherence to these policies is monitored on an ongoing basis  and decisions related to the management of interest rate exposure are made when appropriate 
we manage interest rate risk principally through strategies involving our investment securities portfolio 
our policies permit the use of off balance sheet derivative instruments in managing interest rate risk 
our monitoring activities related to managing interest rate risk include both interest rate sensitivity gap analysis and the use of a simulation model 
while traditional gap analysis provides a simple picture of the interest rate risk embedded in the balance sheet  it provides only a static view of interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time and does not measure the potential volatility in forecasted results relating to changes in market interest rates over time 
accordingly  we combine the use of gap analysis with use of a simulation model that provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest sensitive liabilities that are anticipated to re price within a specific time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities re pricing within that same time period 
positive cumulative gaps in early time periods suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates rise 
negative cumulative gaps suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates fall 
the gap analysis as of december  indicates that the cumulative one year gap as a percentage of interest earning assets was a positive

this analysis assesses the changes in market values of interest rate sensitive financial instruments that would occur in response to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of and basis points and the resulting effect on our mvpe 
policy guidelines establish maximum variances in our mvpe of and in the event of an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of and basis points  respectively 
the following table presents our mvpe exposure at december  and december   related to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of and basis points  respectively 
estimated increase decrease in mvpe change in interest rates basis points estimated mvpe amount percent dollars in thousands december  december  the preceding table indicates that at december   in the event of an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates  our mvpe would be expected to respectively increase or decrease accordingly 
the market value calculations supporting the results in the preceding table are based on the present value of estimated cash flows using both market interest rates provided by independent broker dealers and other publicly available sources that we deem reliable 
these calculations do not contemplate any changes that we could make to reduce our mvpe exposure in response to a change in market interest rates 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding table 
for example  although certain of our assets and liabilities may have similar maturity or re pricing profiles  they may react to changes in market interest rates with different magnitudes 
also  actual prepayment rates on loans and investments could vary substantially from the assumptions utilized in the model in deriving the results as presented in the preceding table 
further  a change in the shape of the forward yield curve could result in different mvpe estimations from those presented herein 
accordingly  the results in the preceding table should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates 
additionally  the resulting mvpe estimates are not intended to represent  and should not be construed to represent the underlying value 
the simulation model also gives us the ability to simulate our net interest income using an interest rate forecast simple simulation 
in order to measure the sensitivity of our forecasted net interest income to changing interest rates utilizing the simple simulation methodology  both a rising and falling interest rate scenario were projected and compared to a base market interest rate forecast derived from the forward yield curve 
for the rising and falling interest rate scenarios  the base market interest rate forecast was increased or decreased  as applicable  by basis points in equal increments over a one year period 
in addition to the basis point ramp scenario mentioned above we run net interest income and net income simulations in an interest rate environment whereby we shock the base rate immediately both up and down basis points 
the combination of the ramp and shock scenarios provides us with additional information with respect to our sensitivity to interest rates and the impact on our net income under varied interest rate scenarios 
our policy guidelines provide that the difference between a base market interest rate forecast scenario over the succeeding one year period compared with the aforementioned rising and falling interest rate scenarios over the same time period should not result in net interest income sensitivity exceeding 
simulations as of december  indicated that we were well within these policy guidelines 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk impacting us 
other types of market risk affecting us in the normal course of our business activities include foreign currency exchange risk  equity price risk  and basis risk 
the impact resulting from these market risks is not considered significant and no separate quantitative information concerning market rate and price exposure is presented herein 
our mvpe exposure at december  increased slightly from december  primarily due to changes in the investment portfolio while staying well within our policy guidelines 
in addition  our net interest income at risk remains well within policy limits 
these estimates are highly assumption dependent and will change regularly as the company s asset liability structure changes and as different interest rate environments evolve 
we expect to continue to actively manage our interest rate risk utilizing on and off balance sheet strategies as appropriate 
liquidity another important objective of asset liability management is to manage liquidity 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet loan demand  to meet depositors needs  and to service other liabilities as they become due without causing an undue amount of cost or risk and without causing a disruption to normal operating conditions 
we regularly assess the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding patterns  present and forecasted market and economic conditions  individual client funding needs  and existing and planned business activities 
our alco provides oversight to the liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines  subject  to board of directors approval  and courses of action to address our actual and projected liquidity needs 
the ability to attract a stable  low cost base of deposits is our primary source of liquidity 
we continue to expand on opportunities to increase our liquidity 
in the third quarter of  we became a member of the federal home loan bank of san francisco adding to our liquidity channels 
other sources of liquidity available to us include federal funds purchased  reverse repurchase agreements  and other short term borrowing arrangements 
our liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of our portfolio of liquid assets 
our definition of liquid assets includes cash and cash equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal business operations  federal funds sold  securities purchased under resale agreements  investment securities maturing within six months  investment securities eligible and available for financing or pledging purposes with a maturity in excess of six months  and anticipated near term cash flows from investments 
our policy guidelines provide that liquid assets as a percentage of total deposits should not fall below 
at december   our ratio of liquid assets to total deposits was 
although this ratio is lower than the comparable ratio of as of december   it is well in excess of our minimum policy guidelines 
in addition to monitoring the level of liquid assets relative to total deposits  we also utilize other policy measures in our liquidity management activities 
as of december  and  we were in compliance with all of these policy measures 
in analyzing our liquidity during  reference is made to our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december   see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 
the statement of cash flows includes separate categories for operating  investing  and financing activities 
operating activities included net income of million for  which was adjusted for certain non cash items including the provision for loan losses  depreciation  deferred tax assets  and an assortment of other miscellaneous items resulting in cash generated from operations 
investing activities consisted of transactions in investment securities resulting in a net cash inflow of million and the net change in total loans which resulted in a net cash outflow of million in the net cash outflow from securities transactions were the net result of investment securities maturities and sales  offset by purchases of securities 
the net cash outflow related to loans relates to loan originations offset by principal collections 
financing activities reflected cash outflows of million resulting from the repurchase of common stock  and net cash outflows of million from decreases in short term borrowings and long term debt 
additionally  our total deposits increased by million during  and we received net cash proceeds received from issuance of common stock totaling million under the provisions of our employee benefit plans 
in total  the transactions noted above resulted in a net cash inflow of million for and total cash and cash equivalents  as defined in our consolidated statement of cash flows  of million at december  on a stand alone basis  silicon is dependent on dividends from silicon valley bank as its primary source of liquidity 
the ability of silicon valley bank to pay dividends is subject to certain regulations  see item business supervision and regulation restriction on dividends 
capital resources our management seeks to maintain adequate capital to support anticipated asset growth and credit risks  and to ensure that silicon and silicon valley bank are in compliance with all regulatory capital guidelines 
our primary sources of new capital include the issuance of trust preferred securities and common stock  as well as retained earnings 
we repurchased million shares of common stock  at an average price of per share  for a total purchase price of million during  in conjunction with the million share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors on september  in november  we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase asr agreement to facilitate the repurchase of our shares of common stock 
pursuant to the agreement  we purchased approximately million shares from the counterparty for approximately million 
the agreement has a five year term 
during the term of the agreement  we have an obligation to sell shares to the counterparty equal to the number of shares we purchased from them at the outset of the agreement 
we may fulfill this obligation either by buying shares in the open market and selling those shares to the counterparty at forward prices specified in the agreement or by issuing new shares and remitting them to the counterparty in exchange for the forward price 
the forward price is based on a formula that begins with the price of the initial purchase and is adjusted for fees and commissions and the length of time from the initial purchase to when shares are sold or delivered to the counterparty 
we have complete discretion as to the timing and amounts of shares that we sell to the counterparty subject to a cumulative minimum of by the end of each year of the agreement 
thus  we are required to sell to the counterparty of the shares in the asr by the first anniversary date  by the second anniversary date  and so on 
we accounted for the initial payment under the asr as a purchase of treasury stock  and we subsequently retired those shares 
the obligation under the forward contract is not recorded in our financial statements  but rather treated as a contingent obligation 
under the agreement  the number of shares to be issued by us  if we were required to pay the counterparty and elected to net settle in shares  is capped at approximately million 
as of the end of  we had purchased in the open market and sold to the counterparty approximately million shares leaving less than  shares remaining under the forward contract obligation 
based on our stock price at the end of the fourth quarter of  we would pay approximately  in cash to the counterparty to settle the asr contract in existence at december  however  for every one dollar of change in the average price of our common stock during the valuation period  the settlement amount would change by about  subsequent to the end of the year  but prior to filing this report  we completed all obligations under the asr 
additionally  during  prior to the asr agreement  we also repurchased million shares of common stock  at an average price of per share  for a total purchase price of million in conjunction with the million shares repurchase program authorized by the board of directors on march  subsequent to the end of  we entered into another asr agreement for million shares for million 
the terms of this second asr arrangement are substantially the same as those in the first agreement described above 
during  we implemented a real estate investment trust reit to serve as a future funding vehicle 
we expect to be able to raise capital through the reit at a lower cost of funds than funds raised directly through silicon valley bank 
additionally  we expect to obtain a tax benefit from the reit structure for several quarters 
during  we repurchased million shares of common stock  at an average price of per share  for a total purchase price of million in conjunction with the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors on april  in december  we issued million shares of common stock at per share 
in january  we issued an additional million shares at per share in relation to the exercise of an over allotment option by the underwriters for that offering 
proceeds from the sale of these securities in december and january totaled million  net of underwriting commissions and other offering expenses 
in august  we issued an additional million shares of common stock at per share 
we received proceeds of million related to the sale of these securities  net of underwriting commissions and other offering expenses 
stockholders equity totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the million balance at december  this decrease in  as compared to  was primarily due to the repurchase of million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million  substantially offset by net income of million and stock issuances under employee stock purchase and option programs 
we have not paid a cash dividend on our common stock since  and we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  funds generated through retained earnings are a significant source of capital and liquidity and are expected to continue to be so in the future 
our management engages in a periodic capital planning process in an effort to make effective use of the capital available to us 
the capital plan considers capital needs for the foreseeable future and allocates capital to both existing business activities and expected future business activities 
expected future activities for which capital is set aside include potential product expansions and acquisitions of new business lines 
once capital is allocated to both existing and future business needs  management determines if any excess capital is available 
if there is  management recommends to the board of directors action steps to use the excess capital 
in  excess capital was used to repurchase shares 
in the future  excess capital may be used to continue repurchases or pay dividends 
as of december   there are no plans for payment of dividends or repurchases in excess of those already disclosed above 
we received an initial credit rating during silicon s credit rating by moody s investor service moody s at december  was baa for issuer rating 
according to moody s  issuers rated baa offer adequate financial security 
however  certain protective elements may be lacking or may be unreliable over any great period of time 
silicon valley bank s credit rating by moody s at december  was a for issuer rating  a for long term deposits  p for short term deposits  and c for financial strength 
moody s bank deposit ratings are opinions of a bank s ability to repay punctually its foreign and or domestic currency deposit obligations 
according to moody s an a rating for deposits represents good credit quality  however  elements may be present that suggest a susceptibility to impairment over the long term 
banks rated p by moody s  for short term deposits offer strong credit quality and a strong capacity for timely payment of short term deposit obligations 
financial strength ratings represent moody s opinion of a bank s intrinsic safety and soundness and  as such  exclude certain external credit risks and credit support elements that are addressed by moody s bank deposit ratings 
banks rated c possess adequate intrinsic financial strength and are typically institutions with more limited but still valuable business franchises  good financial fundamentals  and a predictable and stable operating environment 
the table below presents the relationship between the following significant financial ratios years ended december  return on average assets divided by average equity as a percentage of average assets equals return on average equity times earnings retained equals internal capital growth both silicon s and silicon valley bank are subject to capital adequacy guidelines issued by the federal reserve board 
under these capital guidelines  the minimum total risk based capital ratio and tier risk based capital ratio requirements are and  respectively of risk weighted assets and certain off balance sheet items for a well capitalized depository institution 
the federal reserve board has also established minimum capital leverage ratio guidelines for state member banks 
the ratio is determined using tier capital divided by quarterly average total assets 
the guidelines require a minimum of for a well capitalized depository institution 
both silicon s and silicon valley bank s capital ratios were in excess of regulatory guidelines for a well capitalized depository institution as of december    and see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data note to the consolidated financial statements regulatory matters 
capital ratios for silicon valley bancshares are set forth below december  total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio the decrease in our total risk based capital ratio and the tier risk based capital ratio at the end of from the prior year end was primarily attributable to a decrease in tier capital 
the decrease in all of our regulatory capital ratios between and was primarily due to the reduction of additional paid in capital  which resulted from our stock repurchase programs 
the decrease in our total risk based capital ratio and the tier risk based capital ratio at the end of from the prior year end was primarily attributable to a decrease in tier capital 
this decrease was due to an adjustment for goodwill related to the alliant purchase completed on september  the tier leverage ratio improved as of december   as compared to december   due to a decrease in quarterly average total assets  resulting from a decline in deposits during stock option program our stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests 
we consider our option program critical to our operations and productivity 
our equity incentive plan and our and stock option plans provide for the granting of incentive and nonstatutory stock options 
these options entitle directors  employees  and certain other parties to purchase shares of our common stock at a price not less than and of the fair market value of the common stock on the date the option is granted for incentive and non statutory stock options  respectively 
options may vest over various periods not in excess of five years from the date of grant and expire five to ten years from the date of grant 
subsequent to december   the board of directors of silicon valley bancshares approved an amendment to the equity incentive plan  which provides that the exercise price of each nonstatutory stock option shall be not less than eighty five percent of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option on the date the option is granted and will be in lieu of cash compensation 
decisions regarding compensation of our executive officers  including those related to stock and stock options  are considered by our full board of directors based upon the recommendations and analysis performed by the compensation committee  which is currently composed of members from our board of directors 
all members of the compensation committee are independent directors  as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq stock market

market prices used were those quoted in the national association of securities dealers automated quotation national market 
risk factors our business is subject to a number of risks  including those described below 
if a significant number of clients fail to perform under their loans  our business  profitability  and financial condition would be adversely affected 
as a lender  the largest risk we face is the possibility that a significant number of our client borrowers will fail to pay their loans when due 
if borrower defaults cause losses in excess of our allowance for loan losses  it could have an adverse affect on our business  profitability  and financial condition 
we have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information  the classification of loans and the establishment of loan losses are dependent to a great extent on our experience and judgment 
we cannot assure that our allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to absorb future loan losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business  profitability or financial condition 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses for further discussion on the evaluation process of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
because of the credit profile of our loan portfolio  our levels of nonperforming assets and charge offs can be volatile  and we may need to make material provisions for loan losses in any period  which could cause reduced net income or net losses in that period 
our loan portfolio has a credit profile different from that of most other banking companies 
many of our loans are made to companies in the early stages of development with negative cash flow and no established record of profitable operations 
in some cases  repayment of the loan is dependent upon receipt of additional equity financing from venture capitalists or others 
collateral for many of the loans often includes intellectual property  which is difficult to value and may not be readily salable in the case of default 
because of the intense competition and rapid technological change that characterizes the companies in our technology and life science industry sectors  a borrower s financial position can deteriorate rapidly 
we also make loans that are larger  relative to the revenues of the borrower  than those made by traditional small business lenders  so the impact of any single borrower default may be more significant to us 
because of these characteristics  our level of nonperforming loans and loan charge offs can be volatile and can vary materially from period to period 
changes in our level of nonperforming loans may require us to make material provisions for loan losses in any period  which could reduce our net income or cause net losses in that period 
decreases in amount of capital available to start up and emerging growth companies  could adversely affect our business  profitability  and growth prospects 
our strategy has focused on providing banking products and services to emerging growth and middle market companies receiving financial support from sophisticated investors  including venture capitalists  angels  and corporate investors 
in some cases  our lending credit decision is based on our analysis of the likelihood that our venture capital or angel backed client will receive a second or third round of equity infusion from investors 
the amount of capital available to startup and emerging growth companies has decreased in the past three years  which has caused our client deposit balances to decline 
if the amount of capital available to such companies continues to decrease  it is likely that the number of new clients and investor financial support to our existing borrowers would decrease  having an adverse effect on our business  profitability and growth prospects 
among the factors that have and could in the future affect the amount of capital available to startup and emerging growth companies are the receptivity of the capital markets to initial public offerings or mergers and acquisitions of companies within our technology and life science industry sectors  the availability and return on alternative investments  and general economic conditions in the technology and life sciences industries 
over the past three years  the stock prices of many technology and life science companies have declined substantially  and the capital markets have been less receptive to initial public offerings 
reduced capital markets valuations could further reduce the amount of capital available to startup and emerging growth companies  including companies within our technology and life science industry sectors 
we are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business 
silicon valley bancshares  silicon valley bank  and their subsidiaries are extensively regulated under federal and state law 
these regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors  other clients  and the deposit insurance fund not for the benefit of stockholders or security holders 
federal and state laws and regulations limit the activities in which silicon valley bancshares  silicon valley bank  and their subsidiaries may engage 
in addition  silicon valley bancshares  silicon valley bank and their subsidiaries are required to maintain certain minimum levels of capital 
federal and state banking regulators possess broad powers to take supervisory action  as they deem appropriate  with respect to silicon valley bancshares and silicon valley bank 
alliant partners and svb securities  both broker dealer subsidiaries  are regulated by the sec and the nasd 
violations of the stringent regulations governing the actions of a broker dealer can result in the revocation of broker dealer licenses  the imposition of censures or fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders  and the suspension or expulsion from the securities business of a firm  its officers or employees 
supervisory actions can result in higher capital requirements  higher insurance premiums  and limitations on the activities of silicon valley bancshares  silicon valley bank or their subsidiaries 
these supervisory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability 
warrant  venture capital fund  and direct equity investment portfolio gains or losses depend upon the performance of the portfolio investments and the general condition of the public equity markets  which is uncertain 
we have historically obtained rights to acquire stock  in the form of warrants  in certain clients as part of negotiated credit facilities 
we may not be able to realize gains from warrants in future periods  or our realized gains may be materially less than the current level of unrealized gains disclosed in this filing 
we also have made investments in venture capital funds as well as direct equity investments in companies 
the timing and amount of income  if any  from the disposition of client warrants  venture capital funds and direct equity investments  typically depend upon factors beyond our control  including the performance of the underlying portfolio companies  investor demand for initial public offerings  fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying common stock of these companies  levels of mergers and acquisitions activity  and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities 
in addition  our investments in venture capital funds and direct equity investments have and could continue to lose value or become worthless  which would reduce our net income or could cause a net loss in any period 
all of these factors are difficult to predict  particularly in the current economic environment 
if equity market conditions do not improve  it is likely that additional investments within our existing portfolio will become impaired 
however  we are not in a position to know at the present time which specific investments  if any  are likely to be impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments 
therefore  we cannot predict future investment gains or losses with any degree of accuracy  and any gains or losses are likely to vary materially from period to period 
public offerings and mergers and acquisitions involving our clients can cause loans to be paid off early  which could adversely affect our business and profitability 
while an active market for public equity offerings and mergers and acquisitions generally has positive implications for our business  one negative consequence is that our clients may pay off or reduce their loans with us if they complete a public equity offering or are acquired or merge with another company 
any significant reduction in our outstanding loans could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability 
our current level of interest rate spread may decline in the future 
any material reduction in our interest spread could have a material impact on our business and profitability 
a major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings  and the interest rates we receive on interest earning assets  such as loans extended to our clients and securities held in our investment portfolio 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control  such as inflation  recession  global economic disruptions  and unemployment 
in addition  legislative changes could affect the manner in which we pay interest on deposits or other liabilities 
for example  congress has for many years debated repealing a law that prohibits banks from paying interest rates on checking accounts 
if this law were to be repealed  we would be subject to competitive pressure to pay interest on our clients checking accounts  which would negatively affect our interest rate spread 
any material decline in our interest rate spread would have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability 
for example  over the past two years the federal funds interest rate declined by basis points 
consequently  our net interest margin decreased by basis points  from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of adverse changes in domestic or global economic conditions  especially in the technology sector and especially in california  could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  and profitability 
if conditions worsen in the domestic or global economy  especially in the technology sector  our business  growth and profitability are likely to be materially adversely affected 
current uncertainty surrounding a possible war with iraq is one of many factors that may prevent or delay an economic recovery in the near future 
many of our technology clients have been harmed by the current economic slowdown  and would be further harmed by the continuation or worsening of the global or us economic slowdown 
our clients may be particularly sensitive to disruptions in the growth of the technology sector of the us economy 
in addition  a substantial number of our clients are geographically concentrated in california  and adverse economic conditions in california could harm the businesses of a disproportionate number of our clients 
to the extent that our clients underlying business is harmed  they are more likely to default on their loans 
in  the economic slowdown resulted in both lower average interest earning assets and average client deposit balances  as compared to  thus reducing our net interest income 
net interest income in was million  down from million in if we fail to retain our key employees  our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
we rely on experienced client relationship managers and on officers and employees with strong relationships with the venture capital community to generate new business 
if a significant number of these employees were to leave us  our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
we believe that our employees frequently have opportunities for alternative employment with competing financial institutions and with our clients 
we did not pay any incentive compensation in and paid minimal amounts in the lack of meaningful incentive compensation payouts increases the risk associated with employee retention 
we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our historical levels of profitability in the face of sustained competitive pressures 
other banks and specialty and diversified financial services companies  many of which are larger and have more capital than we do  offer lending  leasing and other financial products to our customer base 
in some cases  our competitors focus their marketing on our industry sectors and seek to increase their lending and other financial relationships with technology companies  early stage growth companies or special industries such as wineries 
in other cases  our competitors may offer a financial product that provides an alternative to one of the products we offer to our clients 
when new competitors seek to enter one of our markets  or when existing market participants seek to increase their market share  new competitors sometimes undercut the pricing and or credit terms prevalent in that market 
our pricing and credit terms could deteriorate if we act to meet these competitive challenges 
we face risks in connection with completed or potential acquisitions 
we completed one acquisition in each of and and  if appropriate opportunities present themselves  we intend to acquire businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are strategic 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully  or to integrate such acquisitions with our current business 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities and or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations  and or financial condition 
any such future acquisitions of other businesses  technologies  services or products might require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing  which might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  and such financing  if available  might be dilutive 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data note to the consolidated financial statements business combinations 
upon completion of an acquisition  we are faced with the challenges of integrating the operations  services  products  personnel  and systems of acquired companies into our business  which may divert management s attention from ongoing business operations 
in addition  acquisitions of new businesses may subject us to regulatory scrutiny 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in integrating any acquired business effectively into the operations of our business 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will be realized 
the price of our common stock may decrease rapidly and significantly 
the market price of our common stock could decrease in price rapidly and significantly at any time 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in recent years 
between january  and december   the closing market price of our common stock has ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
fluctuations may occur  among other reasons  in response to operating results market interest rates perceived value of our warrants  venture capital investments  and direct equity investments trends in our nonperforming assets or the nonperforming assets of other banks announcements by competitors economic changes general market conditions legislative and regulatory changes the trading price of our common stock may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the factors set forth above and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies 
we believe that investors should consider the likelihood of these market fluctuations before investing in our common stock 
we could be liable for breaches of security in our online banking services 
fear of security breaches could limit the growth of our online services 
we offer various internet based services to our clients  including online banking services  a client exchange program  and a web site where our clients can exchange information with one another 
the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential to maintain our clients confidence in our online services 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect client transaction data 
although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to prevent security breaches and periodically test our security  failure to mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect our ability to offer and grow our online services and could harm our business 
people generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
our ability to provide financial services over the internet would be severely impeded if clients became unwilling to transmit confidential information online 
as a result  our operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we face risks associated with international operations 
a component of our strategy is to expand internationally on a limited basis 
expansion into the international markets  albeit on a limited basis  will require management attention and resources 
we have limited experience in internationalizing our service  and we believe that many of our competitors are also undertaking expansion into foreign markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in expanding into international markets 
in addition to the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations and to expand our international presence  there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international basis  including  among others  regulatory requirements  legal uncertainty regarding liability  tariffs  and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  different accounting practices  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability  seasonal reductions in business activity  and potentially adverse tax consequences  any of which could adversely affect the success of our international operations 
to the extent we expand into international operations and have additional portions of our international revenues denominated in foreign currencies  we could become subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that one or more of the factors discussed above will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and or financial condition 
maintaining or increasing our market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services 
our success depends  in part  upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer demand 
there is increasing pressure on financial services companies to provide products and services at lower prices 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new technologies  including internet based services  could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products or services 
a failure to achieve market acceptance of any new products we introduce  or a failure to introduce products that the market may demand  could have an adverse affect on our business  profitability  or growth prospects 
we have businesses other than banking 
in addition to commercial banking services  we provide m a advisory services  merchant banking services  investment advisory services  and other business services 
we may in the future develop or acquire other non banking businesses 
as a result of such other businesses  our earnings could be subject to risks and uncertainties that are different than our commercial banking services 
if alliant partners does not meet earnings targets  we could have an impairment of goodwill 
in  we acquired the assets of alliant partners 
alliant offers merger and acquisition advisory services 
the success of alliant s business is dependent on a number of factors  including the general level of merger and acquisition activity and client company valuations  which have been negatively affected by the current economic slowdown 
success is also dependent on the continued employment of several key employees of alliant 
we test for impairment of goodwill relating to alliant on an annual basis 
as of december   we concluded that goodwill relating to alliant is not impaired 
however  if alliant does not meet projected revenues in the future  or if certain key employees were to leave alliant  we could conclude that the value of the business has dropped and that goodwill relating to alliant has been impaired 
if we were to conclude that goodwill has been impaired  that conclusion could result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge to us  which could adversely affect our results of operations
