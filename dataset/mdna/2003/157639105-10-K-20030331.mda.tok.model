item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results 
the company constantly re evaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the necessary estimates inherent in the preparation of financial statements 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  customer receivables  inventories  assets held for sale  fixed asset lives  contingencies and litigation 
the company has also chosen certain accounting policies when options were available  including o the first in  first out fifo method to value a majority of our inventories  and o the intrinsic value method  or apb opinion no 
 to account for our common stock incentive awards  and o we record an allowance for credit losses based on estimates of customers ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented 
our operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on our operating results is included in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements

recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued the following accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that an obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs be recognized as a liability when incurred 
upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation  an entity would capitalize that cost by recognizing an increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by the same amount as the liability 
an entity would subsequently allocate that asset retirement cost to expense using a systematic and rational method over its useful life 
the company has adopted sfas no 
for its calendar year beginning january  the adoption of sfas no 
should not have a material effect on the company s operating results or financial position 
sfas no  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and an amendment of that statement  sfas no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
the statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas no  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
this statement permits two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the preferable method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
both of those methods avoid the ramp up effect arising from prospective application of the fair value based method 
in addition  to address concerns about the lack of comparability caused by multiple transition methods  this statement does not permit the use of the original statement prospective method of transition for changes to the fair value based method made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company has not yet evaluated whether to adopt this statement nor has it evaluated the potential impact on the company s consolidated financial statements if the statement is adopted 
as of december   the company has adopted the disclosure requirements of the statement and continues to follow the intrinsic value method to account for stock based employee compensation 
fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
it also significantly expands the disclosures guarantors must include in their financial statements 
while the interpretation s accounting provisions are effective prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december   its disclosure requirements generally apply to all guarantees and must be included in financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december  the adoption of interpretation no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities in which the equity investment is insufficient for the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support through other interests who will absorb some or all of the entity s expected losses  or the equity investors lack one or more essential characteristics of a controlling interest 
those characteristics include the ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  the obligation to absorb the entity s expected losses  which makes it possible for the entity to finance its activities  and the right to receive the entity s expected residual returns as compensation for the risk of absorbing expected losses 
this interpretation is effective for the company no later than the third quarter of  and is not currently expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table represents financial data as a percentage of net revenues for the indicated periods year ended nine months year ended december  ended december  march  net revenues gross profit other operating revenues  net selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net other income equity in net income of chateau duhart milon minority interest net income as previously noted  in july  the company shifted a major distribution channel from a broker to a distributor 
commissions and shipping costs incurred for sales to the broker were recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses 
case prices charged to the distributor have been reduced by an amount equal to these commission and shipping costs 
this caused a reduction of in gross profit and a corresponding increase of in selling  general and administrative costs for the year ended december   when compared to previous periods 
for comparability purposes  the company reclassified commissions and shipping costs from selling  general and administrative expenses to net revenues for the nine months ended december  and the fiscal years ended march   and this reclassification resulted in a decrease in gross profit of  and  and a corresponding increase in selling  general and administration costs of  and for the nine months ended december   the fiscal year ended march   and the nine months ended march  revenues net revenues for the year ended december  increased million or as compared to the nine month period ended december  net revenues for the nine months ended december   increased million or over the comparable period in the preceding year 
the increase in relative to comparable periods in is primarily due to the tragic events surrounding september  and the consequential economic downturn experienced by the hospitality industry 
had sales trends remained uninterrupted  revenue increases would have been more consistent with comparable periods 
to a lesser extent  the increases in net revenues were influenced by the sale of the carmenet brand and related inventories 
net revenues for the nine months ended december  decreased million or over the comparable period in the prior year 
once more  the decrease in net revenue reflects the economic decline resulting from the aforementioned events  which was most acutely felt by the company in the last three months of gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  increased million or as compared to the nine months ended december  gross profit for the nine months ended december  increased million over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this was primarily the result of sales volume growth offset by increased discounts and slightly higher costs attributable to the release and sale of vintage wines 
gross profit for the nine months ended december  increased million or over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this was primarily the result of lower costs attributable to the release and sale of vintage wines 
the gross profit percentage remained consistent at for the year and nine months ended december   compared to reported for the nine months ended december  this decrease on gross profits is as expected due to an oversupply of premium wine and increased competition within the wine industry 
gross profit percentage increased to for the nine months ended december   compared to for the nine months ended december  due to increased average sales prices coupled with lower per unit wine costs resulting from higher and harvest yields 
other operating revenues  net revenue from other operations primarily consists of net profit loss from sales of bulk wine and revenue obtained from third party wineries  net of related expenses  for grape crushing or wine bottling 
this aspect of the company s operation is normally not significant 
the company cannot predict the significance of such operations in the future  as this source of revenue is highly unpredictable and largely contingent on other wineries demand for extra production capacity  which can and does vary significantly from year to year 
such revenue for the year ended december  decreased 
million as compared to the nine months ended december  such revenue for the nine months ended december  decreased 
million over the comparable period in the preceding year 
such revenue for the nine months ended december  decreased 
million over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this was attributable to an increase in losses on the sale of bulk wine  due to quality or other factors  for product that is not required in the company s product line 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased million or to of net revenues as compared to the nine month period ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended december   decreased from to of net revenues as compared to the nine month period ended december  this decrease is due to an increase in sales volume and the resulting net revenues growth 
these changes are due to a strategic focus to grow selling and marketing expenditures to remain competitive in these difficult economic times offset by strict operating expense control 
the company reduced its selling  general and administrative costs by 
million for the nine months ended december  as compared to the comparable period in the preceding year 
operating income operating income for the year ended december  increased million or as compared to the nine month period ended december  operating income for the nine months ended december  increased 
million or as compared to the nine month period ended december  operating income for the nine months ended december  increased million or as compared to the nine month period ended december  the increases are due to the increase in gross profits  partially offset by the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses as described above 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense increased by million or as compared to the nine month period ended december  interest expense for the nine months ended december  and increased 
million and 
million  respectively  over the comparable periods in the preceding year 
this increase was a result of higher average outstanding borrowings  which are a result of continuing capital expenditures related to winery and vineyard expansions  amortization of indebtedness renewal costs offset by a reduction in interest rates with the company s revolving bank loan 
additionally  interest expense increased from the issuance of two convertible subordinated promissory notes 
the notes are more fully described in liquidity and capital resources borrowing arrangements below 
other income for the year ended december   other income decreased 
million as compared to the nine month period ended december  other income for the nine months ended december  and decreased 
million and increased 
million  respectively  over the comparable periods in the preceding year 
although not significant to the company s operations  the other income is due to net gains losses from the sale of non strategic assets during for the nine months ended december   the increase in other income was the net result of the sale of the  square foot hewitt house and four surrounding landscaped acres 
equity in net income of duhart milon the company s equity interest in the net income of duhart milon for the year ended december  and for the nine months ended december   and were    and  respectively 
the company monitors its investment in duhart milon primarily through its on going communication with dbr 
such communication is facilitated by the presence of dbr s representation on the company s board of directors 
additionally  various key employees of the company make periodic visits to duhart milon s offices and production facilities 
since the investment in duhart milon is a long term investment denominated in a foreign currency  the company records the gain or loss for currency translation in other comprehensive income or loss  which is a separate component of shareholders equity 
the amount recorded was decreased to million from million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  due to the increase in the relative worth of the euro when compared to the us dollar 
minority interest the minority interest in the net income of edna valley vineyard evv and canoe ridge vineyard  llc crv consists of the following in thousands nine months ended year ended year ended december  december  march  venture minority owner edna valley vineyard paragon vineyard co  inc canoe ridge vineyard various the financial statements of edna valley vineyard evv are consolidated with the company s financial statements 
the interest in evv attributable to parties other than the company is accounted for as a minority interest 
the increase in minority interest was 
million  or for the year ended december  as compared to the nine months ended december  the minority interest for the nine months ended december  and  increased 
million and 
million  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to increased evv net income attributable to higher sales volume with evv wines 
the company acquired the remaining minority interest in canoe ridge vineyard  llc from the other partners in february company management believes that evv will continue to contribute significantly to the company s consolidated results of operations 
net income net income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of 
million  or as compared to the nine month period ended december  net income for the nine months ended december  and  increased 
million and 
million as compared to the preceding period in the prior year 
these increases were primarily due to increased sales volume offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses and interest expense 
seasonality the company s wine sales from quarter to quarter are highly variable due to  among other things  the timing of the release of wines for sale and changes in consumer demand 
sales are typically strongest during the fourth quarter because of heavy holiday sales and because most wines generally are released during the end of the third and beginning of the fourth quarters 
liquidity and capital resources working capital working capital as of december  was million  compared to million at december  the million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory million accounts receivable million  accounts payable and accrued liabilities million offset by a net increase in revolving bank loan borrowings million 
the company has historically funded its growth through increases in borrowings and cash flow from operations 
during  the company s primary use of its capital was to finance capital expenditures of million and a million increase in inventory 
management expects that the company s working capital needs will grow significantly to support expected future growth in sales volume 
due to the lengthy aging and processing cycles involved in premium wine production  expenditures for inventory and fixed assets need to be made one to three years or more in advance of anticipated sales 
the company currently expects its operating and capital spending requirements will total approximately million for the year ending december  the company expects to finance these future capital needs through operations  security offerings  and additional borrowings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain this financing on terms acceptable to the company 
borrowing arrangements on september  the company refinanced certain borrowings through the issuance of million of senior unsecured notes the notes 
proceeds from the notes were used to repay a portion of the company s revolving bank loan in the amount of million and to repay million of another million term loan 
interest on the notes is payable quarterly at rates ranging from to  as amended on february   and principal repayments are scheduled beginning september  through maturity on september  in connection with this refinancing  maximum revolving debt borrowings were reduced from million to million 
the notes were issued pursuant to a note purchase agreement  which contains restrictive covenants including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios and restrictions on additional indebtedness  asset sales  investments  and payment of dividends 
at march  the company was not in compliance with one of these covenants  however  the note holders have subsequently waived such non compliance 
at december  and  the company was in compliance with all bank covenants 
management is in constant communication with our lenders regarding compliance with the financial covenants through december  in the event that economic conditions weaken from  one or more of the financial covenants could be impacted 
our lenders are aware of this possibility and management believes that a waiver or amendment could be obtained 
the company s revolving bank loan expired march  and two extensions were provided extending the maturity date to april  on april   the company finalized the borrowing arrangement with the bank that had provided the revolving bank loan 
the new borrowing arrangement with its bank involves both a million revolving credit facility secured first by inventory and accounts receivable and second by substantially all of the company s fixed assets other than certain specified assets  and a million term loan secured first by certain of the company s fixed assets other than certain specified assets and second by the company s inventory and accounts receivable  each on a pari passu basis with the holders of the notes 
in connection with the finalization  the company amended certain of the provisions applicable to the notes 
on august   the company acquired the winery and vineyard site formerly known as chateau beaucanon winery in rutherford  california 
the site will be used as the home for the provenance vineyard brand 
the purchase price was million 
the acquisition was funded by the issuance of two convertible subordinated promissory notes in exchange for million in cash the notes 
the notes were issued to les domaines baron de rothschild lafite dbr  in the amount of million  and sfi intermediate limited or its affiliates sfi  in the amount of million 
the notes accrue interest on the principal sum at a rate of per annum 
the principal sum and all accrued interest are due and payable in full  two years from the date of the notes the maturity date 
at the maturity date  the company may elect to pay all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest in cash or may elect to repay all or part of these amounts through conversion into shares of company common shares at the conversion price of per share the conversion price 
dbr or sfi may elect to convert all outstanding principal only in the event of a change of control transaction  as defined in the terms of the notes 
in conjunction with the above activities  the company  its lenders under the company s credit agreement and its noteholders under the company s amended and restated note purchase agreement amended the company s credit agreement and its amended and restated note purchase agreement to reflect the lenders and noteholders consent to the beaucanon acquisition and the issuance of the notes and to make certain amendments in the credit agreement and the amended and restated note purchase agreement  including the exclusion of the notes from the financial covenants contained in those agreements 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
to manage this exposure  we have entered into interest rate exchange agreements 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
that establishes new accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet at fair value 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
disclosures about market risk the following disclosures should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these disclosures are intended to discuss certain material risks of the company s business as they appear to management at this time 
however  this list is not exhaustive 
other risks may  and likely will  arise from time to time 
our revenues and operating results fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter we believe period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our revenues will grow or be sustained in future periods or that we will maintain our current profitability in the future 
significant factors in these quarterly fluctuations  none of which are within our control  are changes in consumer demand for our wines  the affect of weather and other natural forces on growing conditions and  in turn  the quality and quantity of grapes produced by us  interest rates and inventory levels and the timing of releases for certain wines  among other factors 
consequently  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating results 
a large portion of our expenses is fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time 
in quarters when revenues do not meet our expectations  our level of fixed expenses tends to exacerbate the adverse effect on net income 
in quarters when our operating results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
our business is seasonal  which could cause our market price to fluctuate our business is subject to seasonal as well as quarterly fluctuations in revenues and operating results 
sales volume tends to increase during summer months and the holiday season and decrease after the holiday season 
as a result  our sales and earnings are typically highest during the fourth calendar quarter and lowest in the first calendar quarter 
seasonal factors also affect our level of borrowing 
for example  our borrowing levels typically are highest during winter when we have to pay growers for grapes harvested and make payments related to the harvest 
these and other factors may cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
our profits depend largely on sales in certain states and on sales of certain varietals in the year ended december   approximately of our wine sales were concentrated in states 
changes in consumer spending in these states and other regions of the country could affect both the quantity and price level of wines that customers are willing to purchase 
approximately of our net revenues in the year ended december  were concentrated in our top four selling varietal wines 
specifically  sales of chardonnay  pinot noir  cabernet sauvignon and merlot accounted for   and of our net revenues  respectively 
competition may harm our business the premium table wine industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented 
our wines compete in all of the premium wine market segments with many other premium domestic and foreign wines  with imported wines coming primarily from the burgundy and bordeaux regions of france and  to a lesser extent  italy  chile  argentina  south africa and australia 
our wines also compete with popular priced generic wines and with other alcoholic and  to a lesser degree  non alcoholic beverages  for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by our independent distributors  many of which carry extensive brand portfolios 
the wine industry has experienced significant consolidation 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and public relations resources than we do 
our sales may be harmed to the extent we are not able to compete successfully against such wine or alternative beverage producers 
agricultural risks could adversely affect our business winemaking and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks 
various diseases  pests  fungi  viruses  drought  frosts and certain other weather conditions can affect the quality and quantity of grapes available to the company  decreasing the supply of the company s products and negatively impacting profitability 
many california vineyards have been infested in recent years with phylloxera 
the company s vineyard properties are primarily planted to rootstocks believed to be resistant to phylloxera 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s existing vineyards  or the rootstocks the company is now using in its planting programs  will not become susceptible to current or new strains of phylloxera 
pierce s disease is a vine bacterial disease that has been in california for more than years 
it kills grapevines and there is no known cure 
small insects called sharpshooters spread this disease 
a new strain of the sharpshooter  the glassy winged  was discovered in southern california and is believed to be migrating north 
the company is actively supporting the efforts of the agricultural industry to control this pest and is making every reasonable effort to prevent an infestation in our own vineyards 
we cannot  however  guarantee that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our vineyards 
future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in grape growing may increase vineyard costs and or reduce production 
grape growing requires adequate water supplies 
we generally supply our vineyards water needs through wells and reservoirs located on our properties 
we believe that we either have  or are currently planning to insure adequate water supplies to meet the needs of all of our vineyards 
however a substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines 
the weather phenomenon commonly referred to as el nino produced heavy rains and cooler weather during the spring of  which resulted in colder and wetter soils than are typical during california s grape growing season 
consequently  the harvest was postponed by approximately four to six weeks depending on the geographic location and varietals 
the size of the company s most significant crops ranged from normal sized yields to of normal yields depending on the varietal and particular estate 
despite the reduction in the yield  the harvested estate crops  in combination with contracted grape purchases  are expected to permit the company to meet originally anticipated sales projections for its vintage chardonnay  cabernet  and merlot varietals 
together these varietals have historically comprised between to of our aggregate annual production 
we may not be able to grow or acquire enough quality grapes for our wines the adequacy of our grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industry wide production levels 
while we believe that we can secure sufficient supplies of grapes from a combination of our own production and from grape supply contracts with independent growers  we cannot be certain that grape supply shortages will not occur 
a shortage in the supply of wine grapes could result in an increase in the price of some or all grape varieties and a corresponding increase in our wine production costs 
an oversupply of grapes may harm our business 
current trends in the domestic and foreign wine industry point to rapid plantings of new vineyards and replanting of old vineyards to greater densities  with the expected result of significantly increasing the worldwide supply of premium wine grapes and the amount of wine which will be produced in the future 
this increase in grape production has resulted in an excess of supply over demand and force wineries to reduce  or not increase prices 
we depend on third parties to sell our wine we sell our products primarily through independent distributors and brokers for resale to retail outlets  restaurants  hotels and private clubs across the united states and in some overseas markets 
to a lesser degree  we rely on direct sales from our wineries  our wine library and direct mail 
sales to our largest distributor and to our ten largest distributors combined represented approximately and  respectively  of our net revenues for the year ended december  sales to our ten largest distributors are expected to continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues in the future 
effective july   the company switched from a single broker to a distributor in california 
the laws and regulations of several states prohibit changes of distributors  except under certain limited circumstances  making it difficult to terminate a distributor for poor performance without reasonable cause  as defined by applicable statutes 
any difficulty or inability to replace distributors  poor performance of our major distributors or our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major distributors could harm our business 
new regulations or increased regulatory costs could harm our business the wine industry is subject to extensive regulation by the federal bureau of alcohol  tobacco and firearms and various foreign agencies  state liquor authorities and local authorities 
these regulations and laws dictate such matters as licensing requirements  trade and pricing practices  permitted distribution channels  permitted and required labeling  advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers 
any expansion of our existing facilities or development of new vineyards or wineries may be limited by present and future zoning ordinances  environmental restrictions and other legal requirements 
in addition  new regulations or requirements or increases in excise taxes  income taxes  property and sales taxes or international tariffs  could reduce our profits 
future legal or regulatory challenges to the industry  either individually or in the aggregate  could harm our business 
we will need more working capital to grow the premium wine industry is a capital intensive business  which requires substantial capital expenditures to develop and acquire vineyards to improve or expand wine production 
further  the farming of vineyards and acquisition of grapes and bulk wine require substantial amounts of working capital 
we project the need for significant capital spending and increased working capital requirements over the next several years  which must be financed by cash from operations and by additional borrowings or additional equity 
adverse public opinion about alcohol may harm our business a number of research studies suggest that various health benefits may result from the moderate consumption of alcohol  but other studies suggest that alcohol consumption does not have any health benefits and may in fact increase the risk of stroke  cancer and other illnesses 
if an unfavorable report on alcohol consumption gains general support  it could harm the wine industry and our business 
we use pesticides and other hazardous substances in the operation of our business we use pesticides and other hazardous substances in the operation of our business 
if hazardous substances are discovered on  or emanate from  any of our properties  and their release presents a threat of harm to public health or the environment  we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation 
payment of such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain insurance against these kinds of risks  and others  under various insurance policies 
however  our insurance may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at a price or on terms that are satisfactory to us 
contamination of our wines would harm our business we are subject to certain hazards and product liability risks  such as potential contamination  through tampering or otherwise  of ingredients or products 
contamination of any of our wines could result in the need for a product recall  which could significantly damage our reputation for product quality  which we believe is one of our principle competitive advantages 
we maintain insurance against certain of these kinds of risks  and others  under various general liability and product liability insurance policies 
however  our insurance may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at a price or on terms that are satisfactory to us 
the loss of key employees would damage our reputation and business our success depends to some degree upon the continued services of a number of key employees 
although some key employees are under employment contracts with us for specific terms  the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could harm our business and our reputation  particularly if one or more of our key employees resigns to join a competitor or to form a competing company 
in such an event  despite provisions in our employment contracts  which are designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets  practices or procedures by such personnel under these circumstances  we cannot be certain that we would be able to enforce these provisions or prevent such disclosures 
shifts in foreign exchange rates or the imposition of adverse trade regulations could harm our business we conduct some of our import and export activity for wine and packaging supplies in foreign currencies 
we purchase foreign currency on the spot market on an as needed basis and engage in limited financial hedging activities to offset the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
there is a risk that a shift in certain foreign exchange rates or the imposition of unforeseen and adverse trade regulations could adversely impact the costs of these items and have an adverse impact on our operating results 
in addition  the imposition of unforeseen and adverse trade regulations could have an adverse effect on our imported wine operations 
export sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated revenue for the nine months ended december  and the volume of international transactions is increasing  which may increase this risk in the future 
infringement of our trademarks may damage our brand names or our business our wines are branded consumer products  and we distinguish our wines from our competitors by enforcement of our trademarks 
there can be no assurance that competitors will refrain from infringing our marks or using trademarks  tradenames or trade dress which dilute our intellectual property rights  and any such actions may require us to become involved in litigation to protect these rights 
litigation of this nature can be very expensive and tends to divert management s time and attention 
our acquisitions and potential future acquisitions involve a number of risks our acquisition of provenance vineyards  hewitt vineyard  suscol ranch  staton hills winery renamed sagelands vineyard  the jade mountain brand  enlarging canoe ridge vineyard and buying out our partners  and potential future acquisitions involve risks associated with assimilating these operations into our company  integrating  retaining and motivating key personnel  integrating and managing geographically dispersed operations integrating the technology and infrastructures of disparate entities  risks inherent in the production and marketing wine and replanting of existing vineyards from white wine grapes to red wine grapes 
we relied on debt financing to purchase provenance vineyards  hewitt vineyard  suscol ranch  staton hills winery  the jade mountain brand  enlarging canoe ridge vineyard and buying out our partners and other vineyard land and related assets during the fiscal years ended december  and consequently our debt to equity ratio is high in relation to our historical standards  even after the successful completion of our rights offering in november the interest costs associated with this debt will increase our operating expenses and the risk of negative cash flow 
the market price of our common stock fluctuates all of the foregoing risks  among others not known or mentioned in this report  may have a significant effect on the market price of our shares 
stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume trading volatility in recent months and years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the specific company s operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may reduce the market price of our shares
