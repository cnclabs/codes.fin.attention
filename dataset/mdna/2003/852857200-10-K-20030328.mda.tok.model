overview stamps 
com provides easy  convenient and cost effective internet based services for mailing or shipping letters  packages or parcels anywhere in the united states and at anytime 
our core mailing and shipping service is designed to allow individual consumers  home offices or small businesses to print us postage or shipping labels using any ordinary pc  any ordinary inkjet or laser printer  and an internet connection 
in october  we began to implement a business strategy to decrease our operating losses and enhance our ability to achieve profitability 
this strategy involved an initial restructuring that reduced our total number of employees by approximately to employees 
we also implemented other cost cutting programs  including a significant reduction and redeployment of our sales and marketing expenses to those programs that demonstrated the best return on investment 
during  we continued to execute our strategy by reducing the total number of employees by approximately to employees in february and by an additional to approximately employees in august we also sold the iship multi carrier shipping service assets to united parcel service for million in may with the restructuring completed  we spent the majority of transforming our core internet postage product by adding two significant new product features 
on july  we launched netstamps 
netstamps allows a customer to print generic postage of any value on special label stock that has labels per an by sheet of paper 
the customer can print any value of postage from 
to 
and up 
the postage does not expire and is not tied to the destination address so it can be printed and stored for later use 
additionally  the postage can be used for any class of mail which allows us to expand beyond our previously supported classes of mail to include such mail classes as international  book rate  and non profit 
one of the more significant results of the netstamps launch is the incremental revenue generated by the sale of these special stock labels 
each netstamps sheet contains labels and is sold in packs of sheets 
in both the third and fourth quarters of we experienced strong netstamps label sales of approximately  and  respectively 
this equates to approximately  sheets sold in the third quarter and approximately  sheets sold in the fourth quarter of on november  we launched our plain paper shipping feature within version of our client software 
this version of our software was designed to enhance shipping functionality  including the ability to print a shipping label with electronic delivery confirmation 
customers are now able to print a shipping label on a plain piece of by printer paper 
this eliminates the need to use part labels and reduces the risk of misprinted postage 
using our new plain paper shipping label allows customers to receive free electronic delivery confirmation with priority mail 
prior to this technology  the united states postal service usps required separate confirmation labels that added an additional step to the process  and delivery confirmation cost an additional 
per package 
electronic signature confirmation and electronic delivery confirmation on other mail classes are also available at discounted rates with a 
savings per package 
customers may also track their packages within our software with an easy status check  thus eliminating the need to key in a long tracking number 
as of march   customers acquired since the november release date have used plain paper shipping for of their total postage prints 

table of contents in october  we announced an expanded three year strategic relationship with microsoft corp 
separately  we are also working to forge improved integration of stamps 
com s online postage technology with microsoft s widely used word software 
the enhanced electronic postage printing functionality is currently being tested in the beta version of microsoft office users who print envelopes using microsoft word will be offered the option of checking a box to add electronic postage 
when they do so  they will be able to print the address and postage on the envelope in a seamless one step process powered by stamps 
com  all without leaving the familiar word interface 
microsoft users will also benefit from features provided by our service such as adding graphics or company logos to a mail piece for a personalized or professional look  keeping track of postage use through reports and accounting codes  minimizing undeliverable mail through automatic address correction and verification  and automatic calculation of postage rates based on mail class and weight of mail piece

sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted 
table of contents for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead would be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
the adoption of sfas no

on january   did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of accounting principles bulletin opinion  reporting the results of operations 
this standard provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
classification as held for sale is an important distinction since such assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value and carrying amount 
this standard also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the period s in which the losses are incurred  rather than as of the measurement date as presently required 
the adoption of the provision of this standard on january  did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or operating results 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and not at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the company expects that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on its financial position or its results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirement of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company adopted this statement in december and its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies general 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to patents  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents restructuring 
we have recorded reserves in connection with our restructuring programs 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations resulting from our actions 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
patents and intangibles 
the company makes estimates of the estimated useful lives of its patents and other amortizable intangibles 
these estimates are made using various assumptions that could change as economic and competitive conditions change 
if events were to occur that would cause the company s assumptions to change  the amounts recorded as amortization would be adjusted 
contingencies and litigation 
the company is involved in various litigation matters as a claimant and as defendant 
the company records any amounts recovered in these matters when collection is certain 
the company records liabilities for claims against it when the losses are probable and estimatable 
any amounts recorded would be based on reviews by outside counsel  in house counsel and management 
actual results may differ from estimates
