item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of transaction services  credit services and marketing services in north america 
we focus on facilitating and managing electronic transactions between our clients and their customers 
we operate in three business segments transaction services  credit services and marketing services 
transaction services 
transaction services is our largest segment accounting for approximately one half of the company 
the transaction services segment primarily generates revenue based on the number of transactions processed  statements generated and customer calls handled 
statements generated and transactions processed are the two primary drivers of revenue for this segment 
statements generated this driver represents the number of statements generated for our private label and utility clients 
although we are paid for other services such as remittance processing and customer care  statements generated represents the approximate number of active accountholders 
transactions processed this driver represents the number of electronic payments processed in merchant services  including credit card  debit card  prepaid card  electronic benefits and fleet and check transactions  and represents approximately one quarter of this segment s revenue 
we are typically paid by our clients for each transaction processed 
credit services 
credit services accounts for approximately one quarter of the company 
the credit services segment primarily generates revenue from servicing fees from our securitization trusts  merchant discount fees  and net finance charges 
private label credit sales and average securitized portfolio are the two primary drivers of revenue for this segment 
private label credit sales this driver represents the dollar value of private label card sales that occur at our clients point of sale terminals  catalogs or web sites 
we are paid a percentage of these sales  referred to as merchant discount  from the retailers that utilize our private label program 
private label credit sales typically lead to higher portfolio balances as cardholders finance their purchases through our bank 
average securitized portfolio this represents the average balance of outstanding receivables from our cardholders that have been securitized 
customers are assessed a finance charge based on their outstanding balance at the end of a billing cycle 
there are many factors that drive the outstanding balances such as payment rates  charge offs  recoveries and delinquencies 
management actively monitors all of these factors 
generally we securitize our receivables  which results in a sale for accounting purposes and effectively removes them from our balance sheet to one of our securitization trusts 
marketing services 
marketing services is represented primarily by our air miles reward program  which we believe to be the largest loyalty program in canada 
we primarily collect fees from our clients based on the number of air miles reward miles issued and in limited circumstances the number of air miles reward miles redeemed 
all of the fees collected for air miles reward miles issued are deferred and recognized over time 
air miles reward miles issued and air miles reward miles redeemed are the two primary drivers of revenue for this segment  and as a result they are both indicators of the success of the program 
these two drivers are also important in the revenue recognition process 
air miles reward miles issued the number of air miles reward miles issued depends upon the buying activity of the collectors at our participating sponsors 
the fees collected from sponsors for the issuance of air miles reward miles represents future revenue and earnings for us 
air miles reward miles redeemed a majority of the revenue we recognize in this segment is derived from the redemptions of air miles reward miles by collectors 
redemptions also show that collectors are attaining the rewards that are offered through our programs 
discussion of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies that are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates that are deemed critical to the determination of operating results 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and  accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
securitization of credit card receivables 
we utilize a securitization program to finance substantially all of the credit card receivables that we underwrite 
our securitization trusts allow us to sell credit card receivables to the trusts on a daily basis 
we use off balance sheet securitization for its lower cost of funds and more efficient use of capital 
in a securitization transaction  we sell credit card receivables originated by our credit services segment to a trust and retain servicing rights to those receivables  an equity interest in the trust  and an interest in the receivables 
the securitization trusts are deemed to be qualifying special purpose entities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap and are appropriately not included in our consolidated financial statements 
our interest in the trusts is represented on our consolidated balance sheet as seller s interest  our interest in the receivables  and due from securitizations  our retained interests and credit enhancement components 
in turn  the trusts issue bonds in the capital markets and notes in private transactions 
the proceeds from the debt are used to fund the receivables  while cash collected from cardholders is used to finance new receivables and repay borrowings and related borrowing costs 
the excess spread is remitted to us as finance charges  net 
our retained interest  often referred to as an interest only strip  is recorded at fair value 
the fair value of our interest only strip represents the present value of the anticipated cash flows we have retained over the estimated outstanding period of the receivables 
this anticipated excess cash flow consists of the excess of finance charges and past due fees net of the sum of the return paid to bond holders  estimated contractual servicing fees and credit losses 
because there is not a highly liquid market for these assets  we estimated the fair value of the interest only strip primarily based upon discount  payment and default rates  which is the method we assume that another market participant would use to purchase the interest only strip 
the estimated market assumptions are applied based upon the underlying loan portfolio grouped by loan types  terms  credit quality  interest rates and geographic location  which are the predominant characteristics that affect payment and default rates 
changes in the fair value of the interest only strip are reflected in financial statements as additional gains related to new receivables originated and securitized or other comprehensive income related to mark to market changes 
in recording and accounting for interest only strip  we made assumptions about rates of payments and defaults  which we believe reasonably reflect economic and other relevant conditions that affect fair value 
due to subsequent changes in economic and other relevant conditions  the actual rates of payments and defaults generally differ from our initial estimates  and these differences could sometimes be material 
if actual payment and default rates are higher than previously assumed  the value of the interest only strip could be impaired and the decline in the fair value recorded in earnings 
further sensitivity information is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the interest only strip is equal to between and of average securitized receivables 
air miles reward program 
because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an air miles reward mile is issued  the recognition of revenue on all fees received based on issuance is deferred 
we allocate the proceeds from issuances of air miles reward miles into two components based on the relative fair value of the related element redemption element 
the redemption element is the larger of the two components 
for this component  we recognize revenue at the time an air miles reward mile is redeemed  or  for those air miles reward miles that we estimate will go unredeemed by the collector base  known as breakage  over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
the total amount of deferred revenue related to the redemption element is shown on the balance sheet as deferred revenue redemption 
service element 
for this component  which consists of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors  we recognize revenue pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
the total amount of deferred revenue related to the service element is shown on the balance sheet as deferred revenue service 
under certain of our contracts  a portion of the proceeds is paid to us at the issuance of air miles reward miles and a portion is paid at the time of redemption 
under such contracts the proceeds received at issuance are initially deferred as service revenue and the revenue and earnings are recognized pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
the amount of revenue ultimately recognized is subject to the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
based on our historical analysis  we make a determination as to average life of an air miles reward mile 
the estimated life is actively monitored by management and subject to external influences that may cause actual performance to differ from estimates 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile is months and has not changed in we believe that the issuance and redemption of air miles reward miles is influenced by the nature and volume of sponsors  the type of rewards offered  the overall health of the canadian economy  the nature and extent of air miles promotional activity in the marketplace and the extent of competing loyalty programs 
these influences will primarily affect the average life of an air miles reward mile 
the shortening of the life of an air miles reward mile will accelerate the recognition of revenue and may affect the breakage rate 
as of december   we had million in deferred revenue that will be recognized in the future 
inter segment sales our transaction services segment performs card processing and servicing activities related to our credit services segment 
for this  our transaction services segment receives a fee equal to its direct costs before corporate overhead plus a margin 
the margin is based on current market rates for similar services 
this fee represents an operating cost to the credit services segment and a corresponding revenue for our transaction services segment 
inter segment sales are eliminated upon consolidation 
use of ebitda and operating ebitda we evaluate operating performance based on several factors  one of which is operating income plus depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
ebitda is presented because it is an integral part of our internal reporting and performance evaluation for senior management 
ebitda eliminates the uneven effect across all segments of considerable amounts of non cash amortization of purchased intangibles recognized in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
in addition  we use operating ebitda to monitor compliance with the financial covenants in our amended credit agreement such as debt to operating ebitda  interest coverage ratios and minimum operating ebitda 
we also use operating ebitda to measure performance and liquidity 
ebitda and operating ebitda are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  either operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance or to the statement of cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  ebitda and operating ebitda are not intended to represent funds available for dividends  reinvestment or other discretionary uses  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the ebitda and operating ebitda measures presented in this form k may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies

asset quality our delinquency and net charge off rates reflect  among other factors  the credit risk of credit card receivables  the average age of our various credit card account portfolios  the success of our collection and recovery efforts  and general economic conditions 
the average age of our credit card portfolio affects the stability of delinquency and loss rates of the portfolio 
we continue to focus our resources on refining our credit underwriting standards for new accounts and on collections and post charge off recovery efforts to minimize net losses 
at december   of securitized accounts with balances and of securitized loans were less than months old 
delinquencies 
a credit card account is contractually delinquent if we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholder s statement 
it is our policy to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts  except in limited circumstances  until the account balance and all related interest and other fees are charged off or paid after days 
when an account becomes delinquent  we print a message on the cardholder s billing statement requesting payment 
after an account becomes days past due  a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account rolling to a more delinquent status 
the collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account 
if we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in house efforts  we engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts 
the following table presents the delinquency trends of our securitized credit card portfolio december  of total december  of total december  of total dollars in thousands receivables outstanding   loan balances contractually delinquent to days    to days    or more days    total    net charge offs 
net charge offs comprise the principal amount of losses from cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances  as well as bankrupt and deceased cardholders  less current period recoveries 
net charge offs exclude current years accrued finance charges and fees 
the following table presents our net charge offs for the periods indicated on a securitized basis 
average credit card portfolio outstanding represents the average balance of the securitized receivables at the beginning of each month in the year indicated 
year ended december  dollars in thousands average securitized portfolio    net charge offs    net charge offs as a percentage of average securitized portfolio we believe  consistent with our statistical models and other credit analyses  that our securitized net charge off ratio will continue to fluctuate 
age of portfolio 
the following table sets forth  as of december   the number of accounts with balance and the related balances outstanding  based upon the age of the securitized accounts age since origination number of accounts percentage of accounts balances outstanding percentage of balances outstanding dollars in thousands months   months  months  months  months   months   total   liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
we have historically generated cash flows from operations  although that amount may vary based on fluctuations in working capital and the timing of merchant settlement activity 
merchant settlement activity is driven by the number of days of float at the end of the period 
as of december   we had one day of float compared to three days at december  our operating cash flow is seasonal  with cash utilization peaking at the end of december due to increased activity in our credit services segment related to holiday retail sales 
year ended december  dollars in thousands cash provided by operating activities before change in merchant settlement activity   net change in merchant settlement activity    investing activities 
we use a significant portion of our cash flows from operations for acquisitions and capital expenditures 
we acquired the following businesses in for a total of million  net of cash acquired  compared to million in business month acquired segment consideration loyalty one  inc january transaction services cash for stock enlogix group august transaction services cash for stock targeted marketing services december transaction services cash for assets in addition  the credit services segment utilizes a securitization program  discussed below  and certificates of deposit to finance our private label credit card program 
net securitization activity utilized million in compared to million in financing activities 
our cash flows used in financing activities was million in compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of million in financing activity primarily is attributed to the pay off of million of subordinated debt to limited brands and welsh carson  offset by borrowing under our credit facilities 
liquidity sources 
in addition to cash generated by operating activities  we have four main sources of liquidity securitization program  certificates of deposit issued by world financial network national bank  our credit facilities and issuances of equity securities 
we believe that internally generated funds and existing sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet current and anticipated financing requirements during the next months 
securitization program and off balance sheet transactions 
since january  we have sold substantially all of the credit card receivables owned by our credit card bank  world financial network national bank  to world financial network credit card master trust and world financial network credit card master note trust  and sometimes through wfn credit company  llc  as part of our securitization program 
this securitization program is the primary vehicle through which we finance our private label credit card receivables 
the following table shows expected maturities for borrowing commitments of world financial network credit card master trust and world financial network credit card master note trust by year total dollars in thousands public notes     private conduits   total     as public notes approach maturity  the notes will enter a controlled accumulation period  which typically lasts three months 
during the controlled accumulation period  we will either need to arrange an additional private conduit facility or use our own balance sheet to finance the controlled accumulation until such time as we can issue a new public series in the public markets 
during november  we completed a million offering of asset backed notes to refinance an existing series of public notes 
the new notes issued in november will mature in november as of december   we had over billion of securitized credit card receivables 
securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash  spread deposits and additional receivables 
the credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the private label credit cards in the securitization trust and their related performance 
during the period from november to january  we are required to maintain a credit enhancement level of of securitized credit card receivables as compared to to for the remainder of the year 
accordingly  at december  we typically have our highest balance of credit enhancement assets 
we intend to utilize our securitization program for the foreseeable future 
if world financial network national bank were not able to regularly securitize the receivables it originates  our ability to grow or even maintain our credit services business would be materially impaired 
world financial network national bank s ability to effect securitization transactions is impacted by the following factors  some of which are beyond our control conditions in the securities markets in general and the asset backed securitization market in particular  conformity in the quality of credit card receivables to rating agency requirements and changes in those requirements  and our ability to fund required overcollateralizations or credit enhancements  which we routinely utilize in order to achieve better credit ratings to lower our borrowing costs 
once world financial network national bank securitizes receivables  the agreement governing the transaction contains covenants that address the receivables performance and the continued solvency of the retailer where the underlying sales were generated 
in the event one of those or other similar covenants is breached  an early amortization event could be declared  in which case the trustee for the securitization trust would retain world financial network national bank s interest in the related receivables  along with the excess interest income that would normally be paid to world financial network national bank  until such time as the securitization investors are fully repaid 
the occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit  or even negate  our ability to securitize additional receivables 
certificates of deposit 
we utilize certificates of deposit to finance the operating activities of our credit card bank subsidiary  world financial network national bank  and to fund securitization enhancement requirements 
world financial network national bank issues certificates of deposit in denominations of  in various maturities ranging between three months and two years and with effective annual fixed rates ranging from to 
as of december   we had million of certificates of deposit outstanding 
certificate of deposit borrowings are subject to regulatory capital requirements 
credit facilities 
we are party to two credit facilities with the same group of lenders 
the first facility  which we entered into on july  and have amended on several occasions since then  provides for million of term loans and a million revolving commitment 
the term loans mature in installments through july  and the revolving commitment matures in july the second facility  which we entered into on may   provides for a million revolving commitment that matures in may the covenants contained in the credit facilities are substantially identical 
at december   we had million outstanding under our credit facilities  consisting of million of term loans and million of borrowings under our million revolving loan commitments 
existing borrowings under the term loans and the revolving facilities bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus applicable euro dollar margins 
at december   the effective interest rates on the two term loans were and  and the approximate effective interest rate on borrowings under the revolving loan facilities was 
our credit facilities allow us to have outstanding funded debt obligations  whether under our credit facilities or otherwise  of up to three times our operating ebitda as defined in the facilities 
based on this covenant  our borrowing capacity at december  would have been approximately million 
with total outstanding borrowings consisting of the credit facilities  certificates of deposit  and subordinated debt of million  we had additional borrowing capacity of million 
in addition  we had million of cash and cash equivalents as of december  we utilize the credit facilities and excess cash flows from operations to support our acquisition strategy and to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
issuances of equity 
on june   we completed our initial public offering  which consisted of the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
after deducting expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions  we received net offering proceeds of approximately million 
we used proceeds of approximately million to repay in full the outstanding balance of a term loan and approximately  was used to repurchase a then outstanding warrant for  shares of our common stock 
the remaining net proceeds were used to pay down additional debt and support our securitization program  acquisitions and other working capital requirements 
in addition  simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering in june  we converted all outstanding shares of our series a cumulative convertible preferred stock into approximately  shares of common stock 
contractual obligations 
the following table highlights  as of december   our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments by type and period less than year years years after years total dollars in thousands certificates of deposit    credit facilities    subordinated debt    operating leases      software licenses      other obligations    we repaid million of subordinated debt during april we believe that we will have access to sufficient resources to meet these commitments 
economic fluctuations although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that we have been significantly affected by inflation 
for the most part  we have relied on operating efficiencies from scale and technology  as well as decreases in technology and communication costs  to offset increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses 
portions of our business are seasonal 
our revenues and earnings are favorably affected by increased transaction volume and credit card balances during the holiday shopping period in the fourth quarter and  to a lesser extent  during the first quarter as credit card balances are paid down 
similarly  our petroleum related businesses are favorably affected by increased volume in the latter part of the second quarter and the first part of the third quarter as consumers make more frequent purchases of gasoline in connection with summer travel 
regulatory matters world financial network national bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the office of the comptroller of the currency 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  world financial network national bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
world financial network national bank is limited in the amounts that it can dividend to us 
quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require world financial network national bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to risk weighted assets and of tier capital to average assets 
under the regulations  a well capitalized institution must have a tier capital ratio of at least  a total capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least and not be subject to a capital directive order 
an adequately capitalized institution must have a tier capital ratio of at least  a total capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least  but is allowed in some cases 
under these guidelines  world financial network national bank is considered well capitalized 
as of december   world financial network national bank s tier capital ratio was  total capital ratio was and leverage ratio was  and world financial network national bank was not subject to a capital directive order 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
sfas eliminates statement and  thus  the exception to applying opinion to all gains and losses related to extinguishments of debt other than extinguishments of debt to satisfy sinking fund requirements the exception to application of statement noted in statement 
as a result  gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in opinion this provision of sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  we expect to adopt this statement in our financial statements and accordingly reclassify extraordinary items for the years ended december  and in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
generally requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this pronouncement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   and is not expected to have a significant impact on us 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
management currently does not plan to transition to the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options 
accordingly  management does not believe that portion of sfas will impact the company 
however  management has provided the required disclosures 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
interpretation no 
requires that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee 
this interpretation is applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  while we have various guarantees included in contracts in the normal course of business  primarily in the form of indemnities  these guarantees do not represent significant commitments or contingent liabilities of the indebtedness of others 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
requires public companies with a variable interest in a variable interest entity to apply this guidance to that entity no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  and immediately for new interests 
this application of the guidance could result in the consolidation of a variable interest entity 
we are evaluating the impact of this interpretation on our financial results 
recent developments in march  we purchased the customer care back office operations of american electric power related to the texas marketplace for approximately million 
as part of the transaction  we will provide billing and customer care services to over  accounts that were recently acquired by a us subsidiary of centrica plc 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our primary market risks include off balance sheet risk  interest rate risk  credit risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and redemption reward risk 
off balance sheet risk 
we are subject to off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business  including commitments to extend credit and our securitization program 
we sell substantially all of our credit card receivables to world financial network credit card master trust  a qualifying special purpose entity 
the trust enters into interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate sensitivity of the securitization transactions 
the securitization program involves elements of credit  market  interest rate  legal and operational risks in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet through our retained interests in the securitization and the interest only strips 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities 
our total interest incurred was approximately million for  which includes both on and off balance sheet transactions 
of this total  million of the interest expense for was attributable to on balance sheet indebtedness and the remainder to our securitized credit card receivables  which are financed off balance sheet 
to manage our risk from market interest rates  we actively monitor the interest rates and the interest sensitive components both on and off balance sheet to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets  net income and cash flow 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates by matching asset and liability repricings and through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
in addition  we enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and treasury locks to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative purposes 
at december   approximately of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of an additional of our outstanding debt at december  was locked at an effective interest rate of through interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks with notional amounts totaling billion 
the approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business 
this approach calculates the impact on pretax income from an instantaneous and sustained increase in interest rates of 
assuming we do not take any counteractive measures  in a increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to interest expense of approximately million 
in  a increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to interest expense of approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease to interest expense 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of financial instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
credit risk 
we are exposed to credit risk relating to the credit card loans we make to our clients customers 
our credit risk relates to the risk that consumers using the private label credit cards that we issue will not repay their revolving credit card loan balances 
we have developed credit risk models designed to identify qualified consumers who fit our risk parameters 
to minimize our risk of loan write offs  we control approval rates of new accounts and related credit limits and follow strict collection practices 
we monitor the buying limits as well as set pricing regarding fees and interest rates charged 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and the canadian dollar through our significant canadian operations 
although we have entered into cross currency hedges to fix the exchange rate on any canadian debt repayment due to a us counter party  we do not hedge our net investment exposure in our canadian subsidiary 
redemption reward risk 
we are exposed to potentially increasing reward costs associated primarily with travel rewards 
to minimize the risk of rising travel reward costs  we have supply agreements with airlines in addition to air canada  are seeking new supply agreements with additional airlines  periodically alter the total mix of rewards available to collectors with the introduction of new merchandise rewards  which are typically lower cost per air miles reward mile than air travel  allow collectors to obtain certain travel rewards using a combination of reward miles and cash or cash alone in addition to using air miles reward miles alone  and periodically adjust the number of miles required to redeem a reward
