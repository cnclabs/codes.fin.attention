table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s financial position reflects management s capital policy guidelines 
these guidelines are intended to ensure that corporate liquidity is adequate to support the company s projected growth rate and to finance the company s ongoing operations in periods of economic downturn 
in a normal operating environment  management intends to direct capital to ongoing operations  strategic acquisitions and other investments that provide opportunities for expansion and enhanced profitability 
our policy is to expand capital resources debt and equity at appropriate times to allow the company to take advantage of favorable capital market conditions  rather than respond to short term needs 
we consider financial flexibility more important than short term maximization of earnings per share through excessive leverage 
therefore  management continuously provides for available credit in excess of near term projected cash needs and has maintained a guideline for long term debt as a percentage of total capitalization in a range of to 
short term liquidity the company relies on cash flow from operations as its primary source of capital 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively  or a three year total of over billion 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during  compared to the prior year  principally reflects a slowing of working capital decreases  partially offset by higher earnings 
cash from operations during increased over the prior year due to a reduction of working capital  partially offset by lower earnings 
working capital  excluding cash and current maturities of long term debt  was of annual sales in this is the lowest year end level of working capital in seven years  and below the company s target of for working capital as a percent of sales 
working capital  excluding cash and current maturities of long term debt  was and of annual sales for the years and  respectively 
the decline in working capital in resulted from both a slower business environment and a concentrated effort beginning during the last half of by management to decrease working capital levels 
the following table shows the annual turnover on average year end working capital  trade receivables and inventories 
the ratios may be affected by timing of the company s acquisitions 
working capital turnover excluding cash and cash equivalents and current debt x x x trade receivables turnover inventory turnover receivables turnover in the aluminum products segment is lower than in the other segments due principally to the seasonal nature of its gas barbecue grill business and industry practices regarding credit terms 
the commercial fixturing components segment has lower inventory turnover than other segments due to increased production time and extended delivery schedules in their business 
the weak economic conditions that began in the last half of and continued through would have normally resulted in reduced cash flow 
the company responded to these difficult business conditions by reducing costs through consolidation or sale of facilities  the restructure of other operations  the reduction of overhead  and the reduction of full time equivalent employment 
in addition  the company has reduced capital spending  brought working capital as a percent of annualized sales to the lowest level in seven years and temporarily reduced the pace of acquisitions 
through these steps  the company has improved operational performance  profit margins and return on shareholders equity 
also  as a result of these improvements  the company has achieved strong growth in cash flow to provide adequate liquidity to finance ongoing operations  repurchase nine million shares of stock  pay down debt and fund a portion of future growth initiatives 
while 
table of contents future economic conditions are uncertain  the company should continue to generate significant cash flow from operations even though additional working capital reductions will be more difficult to achieve 
the company also has sufficient unused committed credit to ensure that future capital resources are adequate for its ongoing operations and growth opportunities 
total capitalization the following table shows the company s total capitalization at the end of the three most recent years 
also  the table shows the amount of unused committed credit available through the company s revolving bank credit agreements  current maturities of long term debt  the amount of cash and cash equivalents  and the ratio of earnings to fixed charges at the end of the three most recent years

long term debt as a percent of total capitalization  net of cash and current maturities  was  and at the end of  and  respectively 
long term debt decreased million from year end  primarily due to a reclass of million in long term debt to current maturities and the maturity and payment of million in medium term notes 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in fair market value related to the company s interest rate swap agreements 
also  during the company capitalized certain leases that were previously accounted for as operating leases under synthetic lease arrangements entered into during the last half of during  certain changes were made to these leases and the company elected early implementation of fasb interpretation no 
 resulting in the recording of these arrangements as capitalized leases in accordingly  property  plant and equipment and long term debt increased by million as a result of this change 
these leases provide economic benefits to the company versus outright purchase of the related assets 
during  million was reclassified from long term debt to current maturities 
until recently  the company had intended to refinance all current maturities of medium term notes and commercial paper on a long term basis 
with the company s current strong cash position  current maturities will likely be paid and not replaced until the need for additional debt arises 
as shown in the preceding table  obligations having scheduled maturities are the current source of the company s debt capital 
at the end of  these obligations consisted primarily of the company s medium 
table of contents term notes and tax exempt industrial development bonds 
the company s senior debt currently carries a moody s rating of a and a standard poor s rating of a 
in february  million of five year notes were issued under a million shelf registration completed in november these notes were converted to variable rate notes under an interest rate swap agreement 
the proceeds of the offering were used to pay down commercial paper and to fund the company s capital expenditures and acquisition activity 
in march  the company sold its rights under this interest rate swap agreement for million 
the secondary source of the company s debt capital consists of revolving bank credit agreements and commercial paper issuances 
management has negotiated bank credit agreements and established a commercial paper program to continuously support the company s projected growth and to maintain highly flexible sources of debt capital 
the majority of the credit under these arrangements is a long term obligation 
if needed  however  the credit is available for short term borrowings and repayments 
to further facilitate the issuance of debt capital  the company has in effect a million shelf registration of debt 
the company has had no commercial paper outstanding at the end of the last three years 
additional details of long term debt  including scheduled maturities  revolving credit and commercial paper are discussed in note f of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
uses of capital resources the company s internal investments to modernize and expand manufacturing capacity totaled million in the last three years 
in  management anticipates internal investments will range from approximately to million 
during the last three years  the company employed million in cash net of cash acquired and issued 
million shares or equivalents of common stock in acquisitions 
during  seven businesses were acquired for million in cash net of cash acquired 
in addition  the company assumed million of acquisition companies debt and other liabilities 
of the seven acquisitions  which should add about million to annual revenue  two were made in residential furnishings  one in commercial fixturing components  one in aluminum products  two in industrial materials and one in specialized products 
additional details of acquisitions are discussed in note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the company also acquired the rod mill and related assets of a bankrupt steel company  which purchase is included in expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
these assets are being refurbished to provide steel rod for the industrial materials segment 
additions  by segment  to property  plant and equipment and purchases of long lived assets are shown in note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
company purchases of its common stock net of issuances totaled million in  million in  and million in these purchases were made primarily for employee stock plans 
the board of directors annually authorizes management  at its discretion  to buy up to two million shares of leggett stock for use in employee benefit plans or for other purposes 
this authorization is continuously replenished as shares acquired are reissued for benefit plans 
in addition  management is authorized  again at its discretion  to repurchase any shares issued in acquisitions 
at the end of the third quarter  the board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional million shares of leggett stock 
in august  the board of directors continued this authorization for an additional period expiring in september as of december  the company had acquired approximately 
million shares under such authorization 
no specific schedule of purchases has been established under this authorization 
the amount and timing of purchases will depend on availability of cash  economic and market conditions  acquisition activity and other factors 
cash dividends on the company s common stock in the last three years totaled million 
over this three year period  cash dividends per share have increased at an compounded annual rate 
the company s guideline for dividend payout is approximately one third of the prior three year s average earnings 
as a percent of the prior three year average earnings  cash dividends per share were in  in and in as earnings recover  the company expects to move back toward its dividend payout target 

table of contents the following table summarizes the company s future contractual obligations and commercial commitments amounts in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations excluding million of fair market value from interest rate swap agreements 
the long term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if the company was not able to make its principal and interest payments when due  or satisfy certain debt covenants under its revolving credit agreements 
the company believes it has sufficient ongoing cash flow and capital resources to satisfy these obligations and to maintain its required debt covenants 
results of operations discussion of consolidated results in  earnings increased on essentially flat same location sales 
revenues totaled billion  second only to the record set in  and an increase of from same location sales increased  or million  for the full year 
earnings  at per diluted share  were up  or  from last year s 
pretax restructuring costs were approximately million in  versus million in during  sales were billion  a decrease of versus the record sales of billion set in  declining for just the second time in the company s history as a public company 
sales growth from acquisitions was more than offset by a decline in same location sales  as decreased unit volumes from weak market demand continued to negatively impact all five business segments 
earnings per diluted share  at 
were down  or  from in the following table shows various measures of earnings as a percentage of sales for the last three years 
it also shows the effective income tax rate 
gross profit margin ebit earnings before interest and taxes margin net profit margin effective income tax rate the improvement in ebit margins during resulted primarily from reduced expenses 
same location sales growth of and continued improvements in operating efficiency also helped margins 
cost decreases resulted primarily from the elimination of goodwill amortization  lower bad debt  energy and restructuring costs  plus the partial reversal of canadian lumber duty accruals 
partially offsetting these improvements  and the major factors impacting the decrease in gross profit margin  were higher raw material costs most notably steel and margin ie  selling price pressure in some business units 
reduced interest expense as a result of lower borrowings and interest rates also helped improve earnings for the lower effective income tax rate in compared to and levels reflects the impact of eliminating non deductible goodwill amortization as required by fasb statement no 
the declines in margins primarily reflect weakened demand in all of the company s business segments  as well as lower than expected performance in the company s aluminum products and commercial fixturing components segments and some parts of the residential furnishings segment 
production cutbacks  
table of contents plant restructuring and closure costs  reduced plant utilization and resulting lower overhead absorption significantly impacted profit and ebit margins 
plant utilization in was further reduced due to the company s efforts to reduce inventory levels 
margins were also reduced in by higher bad debt expense  worker s compensation costs  medical expenses and energy costs 
lower incentive compensation costs  cost structure improvements and reduced overhead as a result of the company s tactical plan announced in september helped offset these increasing costs 
interest expense was lower in versus  partially offsetting the decline in net margin 
restructuring activity in connection with its tactical plan announced during the third quarter of aimed at improving performance  margins and shareholder return  the company s primary objective was to fix problems in its under performing businesses 
operations that could not be fixed were to be consolidated  closed or sold 
as a part of its continued focus on cost structure improvement  through december the company had consolidated or sold certain facilities and restructured other operations 
the costs incurred related to the company s restructuring efforts were charged to expense 
included in the company s operating results for are restructuring charges of million pretax associated with these decisions 
charges of million are included in other deductions income  net  and consist of million for fixed asset and goodwill write downs  and million in severance and other costs  net of miscellaneous proceeds 
the remaining million inventory charges are in the cost of goods sold section on the consolidated statement of earnings

restructuring liabilities from and prior years are not material to the accompanying balance sheet 
adjustments of previously established accruals and liabilities relating to restructuring activities have been negligible 
the balances remaining in restructuring reserve on the company s balance sheet were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company expects to realize future cost savings as a result of these actions  however  the specific impact cannot be quantified  and will be determined by future business conditions 
the company may occasionally rationalize its facility base in the future if compelling savings are evident  or if the economic environment induces such action 
see note m of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding restructuring activities 
discussion of segment results a description of the products included in each segment  segment sales  segment earnings before interest and taxes ebit and other segment data appear in note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
following is a comparison of ebit margins segment ebit divided by total segment sales residential furnishings commercial fixturing components aluminum products industrial materials specialized products 
table of contents residential furnishings sales increased  or million during  primarily from a increase in same location sales 
ebit increased  or million  due in part from higher sales and cost improvement efforts 
sales of upholstered furniture components increased significantly  but these gains were tempered largely by flat sales in bedding and other product categories 
elimination of million of goodwill amortization  partial reversal of canadian lumber duty accruals  reduced bad debt expense  lower energy costs and million in lower restructuring costs all contributed to the ebit improvements 
margin pressure from higher raw material costs in steel  lumber and chemicals partially offset some of these gains 
during  residential furnishings sales decreased 
same location sales  which were partially offset by acquisitions  decreased 
ebit declined million  or  as soft industry demand and inventory reduction efforts resulted in lower production 
the lower plant utilization reduced overhead absorption  yielding lower margins 
also negatively impacting ebit during were restructuring charges of million 
commercial fixturing components sales decreased during incremental sales from recent acquisitions were not able to overcome the  or million decline in same location sales 
markets for both store fixtures and office furniture components remain depressed  down approximately from levels seen two years ago 
however  the company has gained market share in its fixture and display businesses  due in part to the financial difficulties of some competitors brought about by the tough conditions the industry has faced over the past years 
ebit decreased million  or  with the earnings impact from lower same location sales largely offset by million in lower restructuring costs  elimination of million of goodwill amortization  and cost structure improvements 
during  commercial fixturing components sales decreased  while same location sales  which were partially offset by acquisitions  declined 
ebit decreased million  or  due primarily to lower same location sales and reduced margins  reflecting poor business conditions in the office and contract furniture markets  continued market weakness and reduced fixture purchases in telecom and utility van industries  and plant inefficiencies 
restructuring charges of million also negatively impacted ebit 
aluminum products sales increased million  or  during same location sales increased for the year  and averaged growth for the final three quarters of the year 
the growth is attributable to leggett s efforts to gain market share  as market demand did not improve appreciably 
the company also divested three firms during  which will reduce annual revenue in the aluminum products segment by about million 
these divestures will not have a material impact on earnings 
ebit increased  or million 
the earnings gain reflected sales increases  which resulted from significant efforts to gain market share 
cost management efforts  reduced amortization expense of million and lower energy costs also benefited ebit 
these improvements were partially offset by restructuring costs of million and non recurring inventory and equipment obsolescence charges 
higher raw material cost and minor impacts from start up inefficiency associated with new business also reduced ebit 
during  aluminum products sales decreased 
same location sales were down  and were slightly offset by one acquisition 
reduced die cast component sales reflected weak market demand in a variety of consumer and industrial sectors including telecom  electrical  diesel engine and barbecue grill markets 
ebit decreased million  or 
the ebit decrease resulting from declining sales was partially offset by reduced overhead and lower restructuring costs of million 
industrial materials sales increased during  primarily due to acquisitions 
same location sales increased 
ebit declined  or million 
the majority of the ebit decline for the year resulted from increased steel prices 
these increases began in the second quarter as a result of tariffs imposed on foreign steel 
steel prices began to stabilize late in the year  and by year end  the company was able to pass on the majority of the increases to customers 
however  there remains some continued impact on margins 
startup costs associated with a steel rod mill also negatively impacted ebit 
reduced bad debt expense and elimination of million in amortization expenses benefited ebit slightly 

table of contents the company acquired the rod mill assets of a bankrupt steel company during the year 
the rod mill  which became operational in the first quarter of  will supply about half the company s steel rod needs  improve the consistency and quality of this key raw material  and will help alleviate supply concerns arising from many recent steel company bankruptcies and recently imposed steel tariffs 
the rod produced will be consumed by the company s wire mills 
inter company sales at market value of this steel rod mill should approximate million annually 
in  industrial materials sales decreased 
same location sales were down  and were partially offset by acquisitions 
ebit decreased million  or  primarily as a result of reduced sales volumes and lower plant utilization 
specialized products sales increased in  mainly from a increase in same location sales 
ebit increased million  or  due to higher automotive sales and elimination of million of goodwill amortization  partially offset by reduced sales volume in the machinery group 
the strong performance of our automotive businesses is due primarily to additional market penetration and strong demand for lumbar and seat components 
during  specialized products sales increased due to acquisitions  partially offset by a decline in same location sales 
ebit decreased million  or  due primarily to slowing production and reduced demand in automotive markets and the machinery group  along with changing product mix 
goodwill amortization the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in statement no 
requires  among other things  that goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be tested periodically for impairment 
as required  the company adopted statement no 
on january   and ceased amortization of goodwill 
the goodwill amortization change contributed approximately ten cents per share to annual earnings 
earnings per share  adjusted for fas no 
treatment of goodwill amortization  would have been basic and diluted on pro forma net earnings of million in and basic and diluted on pro forma net earnings of million in see note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on goodwill amortization 
as required by statement no 
 the company tested each of its reporting units for possible goodwill impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each unit with the related book value 
in each case  the estimated fair value exceeded the book value  accordingly  there was no asset impairment 
seasonality the percent of consolidated net sales by quarter  excluding the impact of acquisitions  is as follows for the last three years first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year the company does not experience significant seasonality  however  as indicated in the above table  quarter to quarter sales are expected to vary in proportion to the total year by up to 
the timing of acquisitions and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of the company s businesses 
in each of the three years presented  the economic slowdown impacted the company s various businesses and 
table of contents normal seasonality was likely distorted somewhat 
nevertheless  for the company s businesses in total  the second and third quarters have proportionately greater sales  while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower 
residential furnishings and commercial fixturing components typically have their strongest sales in the second and third quarters 
commercial fixturing components has particularly heavy third quarter sales of its store fixtures products  with the first and fourth quarters generally lower 
aluminum products sales are proportionately greater in the first two calendar quarters due to its gas barbecue grill business 
industrial materials sales peak in the third and fourth quarters from wire products used for baling cotton 
specialized products has relatively little quarter to quarter variation in sales  although the automotive business is somewhat heavier in the first two quarters of the year  and somewhat lower in the third quarter  due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer 
major accounting policies  estimates and other factors influencing financial reporting as more fully disclosed in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has adopted numerous accounting policies from among acceptable alternatives  and management must make many critical estimates or assumptions when preparing financial statements 
the most critical estimates and assumptions impacting the ongoing operations are as follows credit losses  costs related to worker s compensation  automobile  product and general liability  property and medical programs  inventory losses from obsolescence  and various assumptions impacting the fair value of the company s reporting units for goodwill impairment testing under fasb statement no 
with respect to credit losses  the company s customers are diverse  but many are small to medium size companies and some are highly leveraged 
bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning  particularly in the current economic environment  adding to the difficulty in estimating credit losses 
worker s compensation and other program costs may require a long period after the actual loss occurred before the exact amount of the cost is known 
estimates of these costs over that period  which in some cases is several years  will vary from the final amount 
the company carries insurance for individual losses that exceed a certain amount specified for each program 
changing customer specifications  technology  customer bankruptcy and other factors result in inventory losses that are difficult to estimate precisely 
at any financial statement date  the impact of these factors on inventory value may not be completely known 
the company s accounting estimates of these costs and losses are based on available actuarial estimates  prior experience and close monitoring of each loss exposure 
fasb statement no 
requires the company to periodically test for goodwill impairment by estimating the fair value of each reporting unit 
the company has eleven reporting units as defined by fasb statement no 
major assumptions used in the determination of fair value are future sales growth rates  operating margins  capital expenditures and the discount rate 
except for the discount rate  these assumptions are initiated by the business managers and reviewed by senior management for reasonableness and consistency 
future actual results  however  will vary from these assumptions 
the most significant estimates  other than for ongoing operations  are for exposure to unusual litigation and claims and for the impact of plant restructurings and closings 
accounting periods are impacted by these losses when specific facts are known which affect the loss estimate 
the company has not recorded any significant losses for litigation and claims for  and management is not aware of any significant unrecorded exposures 
the company records restructuring or plant closing losses when specific implementation actions have been approved 
no significant income is reflected in the financial statements for the reversal of restructuring or plant closing losses accrued in a prior period 
changes in the liabilities  reserves and accruals related to the critical estimates and assumptions made above are regularly reviewed by management with the company s audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents new financial accounting standards board statements during  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
statement no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value when the liability is incurred  instead of recognizing the liability at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the impact on the company will not be different than under eitf no 
other than in the period in which such exit or disposal costs are recorded 
the company may occasionally rationalize its facility base in the future if compelling savings are evident  or if the economic environment induces such action  and statement no 
would be applied to any such decisions 
during december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company will adopt the prospective transition method permitted by statements and and begin expensing stock options granted in based on current levels  in the first year  implementation of this statement is expected to reduce earnings by approximately cents per share  and the impact on earnings is expected to grow to approximately cents per share over time
