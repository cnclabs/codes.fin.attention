item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under business risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a leading provider of information technology services and solutions to federal government clients in three principal markets national security  civil government  and health care and public health 
since our founding in  we have derived substantially all of our revenue from services provided to federal government clients 
we expect that federal government clients will continue to account for substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
during each of our last three fiscal years  we recognized more than of our revenue from contract engagements in which we acted as a prime contractor 
our contract base is diversified among federal government clients  and we currently serve over government clients on more than active engagements 
no single engagement accounted for more than of our revenue during the last three fiscal years 
the internal revenue service  as a client group  accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal no other client or client group accounted for more than of our revenue in the last three fiscal years 
our backlog as of june  was approximately billion  of which million was funded 
our backlog as of june  was billion  of which million was funded 
we define our backlog to include both funded and unfunded orders for services under existing signed contracts  assuming the exercise of all priced options relating to those contracts 
we currently expect to recognize revenue during fiscal from approximately of our total backlog as of june  our backlog includes orders under contracts that in some cases extend for several years  with the latest expiring at the end of calendar year we have had three operating segments for financial reporting purposes during the periods covered by this discussion and analysis 
our reportable segments include the consulting and systems integration business  or c si  the emerging technologies business  or et  and the legal systems integration business  or lsi 
the c si segment represents our core business and includes high end consulting services and information technology solutions primarily for federal government clients 
this segment focuses on our three principal markets national security  civil government  and health care and public health 
as of june   the c si segment represents all of our ongoing operations 
the et segment historically performed advanced technology research and development  sought commercial applications for this technology  and managed our commercial software products and services offerings  including the assentor practice 
substantially all et segment activities had ceased as of june  substantially all et segment employees were redeployed to the c si segment or terminated as of the end of fiscal as of july   the only remaining activity in the et segment was our assentor practice 
in october  we sold our assentor practice to a third party for approximately million 
the lsi segment consisted of our legal systems integration business  which we closed as of december  the legal systems integration business provided network and desktop integration services for large law firms 
increasingly  these law firms retained their own internal staff to perform this work and the nature of our services to these clients became commoditized 
as a result  there were fewer engagements of the scale and margin potential to justify maintaining this business 
because we closed the lsi segment as of december   our financial statements covering periods after that date do not reflect any results from the lsi segment and will not in the future 

table of contents the following table summarizes the percentage of total revenue for each period represented by each of our reportable segments 
year ended june  segment consulting systems integration emerging technologies legal systems integration we have historically invested in applied research and development to develop new technologies that enhance our information technology services and solutions 
some of these investments have supported the c si segment  while others were independent initiatives and were reflected in the et segment 
some of our research and development investments have led to the formation of separate companies  including mail  inc  which provided software based services to expedite the delivery of large volumes of mail  and mantas  inc  which provides services to the financial services industry to address anti money laundering and other data mining issues 
in february  we sold our minority interest in mail  inc  recognizing a pre tax gain of million  including the reversal of a  accrual for probable losses under funding commitments we made to mail  inc in may  mantas  which was previously one of our service offerings  was contributed to a separate company  mantas  inc  which we formed with funding and other contributions received from safeguard scientifics and the national association of securities dealers  inc  or the nasd 
we have retained a non controlling equity interest in mantas  inc in october  we sold our assentor practice for approximately million 
although we believe it is important to continue to invest in technology to enhance our information technology services and solutions  we have eliminated such spending in the et segment and expect all future research and development expenses to be targeted to the needs of our federal government customers as we have sharpened our focus on our core c si business 
in the future  we intend to focus on increasing our internal growth  and we may pursue strategic acquisitions that can cost effectively add new clients  specific agency knowledge  or technological expertise 
in january  we made our first government services acquisition  acquiring the marasco newton group ltd  or mng  for its expertise in the federal government environmental market 
in january  we acquired adroit systems  inc  or adroit  for its expertise in the areas of command and control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance  or cisr 
we expect that these acquisitions will enable us to sell our services and solutions to mng s and adroit s existing client base and to jointly pursue potential new opportunities 
description of critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition  doubtful accounts receivable  goodwill and other intangible assets  and other contingent liabilities 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable at the time the estimates are made 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies requiring us to make significant estimates and judgments are revenue recognition  contract cost accounting  and accounting for acquisitions  including the identification of intangible assets and the ongoing impairment assessments of the intangible assets 
if any of these estimates or judgments prove to be incorrect  our reported results could be materially affected 

table of contents revenue recognition most of our revenue is generated on the basis of services provided to the federal government  either by our employees or by our subcontractors 
to a lesser degree  the revenue we earn may include third party hardware and software that we purchase and integrate when requested by the client as a part of the solutions that we provide to our clients 
contract types 
when contracting with our government clients  we enter into one of three basic types of contracts cost plus fee  time and materials  and fixed price 
cost plus fee contracts 
cost plus fee contracts provide for reimbursement of allowable costs and the payment of a fee  which is our profit 
cost plus fixed fee contracts specify the contract fee in dollars 
cost plus award fee contracts may provide for a base fee amount  plus an award fee that varies  within specified limits  based upon the client s assessment of our performance as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost  quality  schedule  and performance 
the majority of our cost plus fee contracts are cost plus fixed fee 
time and materials contracts 
under a time and materials contract  we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and out of pocket expenses 
to the extent our actual direct labor costs vary in relation to fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract  we will generate more or less profit  or could incur a loss 
fixed price contracts 
under a fixed price contract  we agree to perform the specified work for a pre determined price 
to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated  we will generate more or less than the anticipated amount of profit or could incur a loss 
some fixed price contracts have a performance based component  pursuant to which we can earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance 
our historical contract mix  measured as a percentage of total revenue for each period  is summarized in the table below 
year ended june  contract type cost plus fee time and materials fixed price our government clients typically determine what type of contract will be awarded to us 
in general  cost plus fee contracts are the least profitable of our contract types 
recently  the relative mix of our cost plus fee contracts has declined 
although we have recently been awarded some large cost plus fee contracts  we are unable to predict the timing of any impact on our total contract mix or whether this will cause our operating margins to suffer in any future period 
critical accounting policies relating to revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  or goods delivered  the contract price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have a standard management process that we use to determine whether all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
this standard management process includes a regular review of our contract performance 
this review covers  among other matters  outstanding action items  progress against schedule  effort and staffing  requirements stability  quality  risks and issues  subcontract management  cost  commitments  and client satisfaction 
this review is designed to determine whether the overall progress on a contract is consistent with the effort expended and revenue recognized to date 
absent evidence to the contrary  we recognize revenue as follows 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts is recognized to the extent of costs actually incurred plus a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
we consider fixed fees under cost plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs actually incurred in 
table of contents performance of the contract 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized based on the hours actually incurred at the negotiated contract billing rates  plus the cost of any allowable material costs and out of pocket expenses 
revenue on fixed price contracts is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
unless it is determined as part of our regular contract performance review that overall progress on a contract is not consistent with costs expended to date  we determine the percentage completed based on the percentage of costs incurred to date in relation to total estimated costs expected upon completion of the contract 
revenue on fixed price contracts pursuant to which a client pays us a specified amount to provide only a particular service for a stated time period  a so called fee for service arrangement  is recognized as amounts are billable  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
we consider performance based fees  including award fees  under any contract type to be earned when we can demonstrate satisfaction of a specific performance goal or we receive contractual notification from a client that the fee has been earned 
contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation 
examples of estimates include the contemplated level of effort to accomplish the tasks under contract  the cost of the effort  and an ongoing assessment of our progress toward completing the contract 
from time to time  as part of our standard management processes  facts develop that require us to revise our estimated total costs or revenue 
in most cases  these revisions relate to changes in the contractual scope of our work 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects contract profit or revenue previously recognized  we record the cumulative effect of the revision in the period in which the facts requiring the revision become known 
the full amount of an anticipated loss on any type of contract is recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
from time to time  we may proceed with work based on client direction pending finalization and signing of formal contract documents 
we have an internal process for approving any such work 
revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
we base our estimates on previous experiences with the client  communications with the client regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
we maintain reserves for doubtful accounts receivable that may arise in the normal course of business 
historically  we have not had significant write offs of doubtful accounts receivable related to work we perform for the federal government 
however  we do perform work on contracts and task orders where on occasion issues arise that lead to accounts receivable not being fully collected 
contract cost accounting as a contractor providing services primarily to the federal government  we must categorize our costs as either direct or indirect and allowable or unallowable 
direct costs are those costs that are identified with specific contracts 
these costs include labor  subcontractor and consultant services  third party materials purchased under a contract  and other non labor costs incurred in support of a contract 
indirect costs are those costs not identified with specific contracts 
rather  indirect costs are allocated to contracts in accordance with federal government rules and regulations 
these costs typically include our selling  general  and administrative expenses  fringe benefit expenses  and depreciation and amortization costs 
direct and indirect costs that are not allowable under the federal acquisition regulation or specific contract provisions cannot be considered for reimbursement under our federal government contracts 
we must specifically identify these costs to ensure we comply with these requirements 
our unallowable costs include a portion of our executive compensation  certain employee morale activities  certain types of legal and consulting costs  and the amortization of identified intangible assets  among others 
a key element to our recent margin expansion has been our success at controlling indirect cost growth and unallowable costs 
in addition  as we acquire and integrate new companies  we have been able to manage our indirect costs and improve operating margins by realizing opportunities for cost synergies and integrating the indirect support functions of acquired companies into our own 
accounting for acquisitions the purchase price that we pay to acquire the stock or assets of an entity must be assigned to the net assets acquired based on the estimated fair market value of those net assets 
the purchase price in excess of the 
table of contents estimated fair market value of the tangible net assets and separately identified intangible assets acquired represents goodwill 
the purchase price allocation related to acquisitions involves significant estimates and management judgments that may be adjusted during the purchase price allocation period  but in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date 
we must evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or during any interim period if we have an indication that goodwill may be impaired 
we assess the potential impairment of goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of our reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of january  there was no indication of goodwill impairment as a result of our impairment analysis 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it would have an adverse non cash impact on our results of operations 
the estimated fair market value of identified intangible assets is amortized over the estimated useful life of the related intangible asset 
we have a process pursuant to which we retain third party valuation experts to assist us in determining the fair market values and useful lives of identified intangible assets 
we evaluate these assets for impairment when events occur that suggest a possible impairment 
such events could include  but are not limited to  the loss of a significant client or contract  decreases in federal government appropriations or funding for specific programs or contracts  or other similar events 
none of these events have occurred for fiscal we determine impairment by comparing the net book value of the asset to its future undiscounted net cash flows 
if an impairment occurs  we will record an impairment expense equal to the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated discounted cash flows using a discount rate based on our cost of capital and the related risks of recoverability 
statement of operations items the following is a description of certain line items and other components of our consolidated statements of operations 
cost of services cost of services includes the direct costs to provide our services and business solutions to clients 
the most significant of these costs are the salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits  of our employees directly serving clients 
cost of services also includes the cost of subcontractors and outside consultants  third party materials  such as hardware or software that we purchase and provide to the client as part of an integrated solution  and any other direct costs such as travel expenses incurred to support contract efforts 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses include the salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits  of our employees not performing work directly for clients 
among the functions covered by these costs are asset and facilities management  business development  research and development  contracts and legal  finance and accounting  executive and senior management  human resources  and information system support 
facilities related costs are also included in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
historically  the portion of selling  general  and administrative expenses that relate to corporate support functions are allocated to segments based on the ratio of segment labor expenses to total labor  exclusive of corporate selling  general  and administrative labor 
the total amount of corporate selling  general  and administrative expense allocated to segments was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
with the elimination of all et segment activities in fiscal  all selling  general  and administrative expenses that relate to corporate support functions for the year ended june  were assigned to the c si segment 

table of contents stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense reflects expenses related to stock option grants for which pre existing grant terms were modified or for which the exercise price was below fair market value 
stock based compensation expenses are included in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
stock based compensation expenses were  for fiscal and  for fiscal as of june   we had  of deferred stock based compensation expense  which will be recognized ratably over the month remaining vesting period of the related stock options 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of computers and other equipment  the amortization of software we use internally  the amortization of leasehold improvements  and the amortization of identified intangible assets 
these depreciation and amortization expenses are allocated to segments based on the ratio of segment labor expenses to total labor  exclusive of corporate selling  general and administrative labor 
the amortization of computer software developed for sale to clients is included in cost of services 
reimbursement of expenses upon formation of mantas  inc in december  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  mantas llc  with the expectation that we would transfer our mantas service offering  consisting of contracts  people  and intellectual property  to mantas llc on or about january  and a third party investor would acquire an equity interest in mantas llc for cash 
to allow the participation of an additional strategic investor  the actual funding and closing was delayed until may  we continued to own  develop and operate the mantas service offering we had planned to transfer to mantas llc until may  we did this with the understanding from the third party investors that  once mantas llc was funded  we would be reimbursed by mantas llc for the operating costs of the mantas service offering from january  to closing 
operations of the mantas service offering for the period from january  to may  resulted in our incurring approximately million of expenses and realizing approximately million of revenue  which we included in our operating results as revenue and expenses 
on may   mantas llc converted from a limited liability company to a corporation and changed its name to mantas  inc on the same day  we transferred the contracts  people  and intellectual property rights of our mantas service offering to mantas  inc in exchange for a non controlling interest in mantas  inc subsequent to may   mantas  inc 
reimbursed us for the expenses described above and we paid mantas  inc for the revenue described above 
this resulted in a net reimbursement to us of approximately million which is recorded as a separate line item in our operating results 
since may   we have accounted for our investment in mantas  inc using the equity method of accounting 
gains and losses on equity method investments we use the equity method of accounting for investments in which we do not have a controlling interest but exercise significant influence 
under the equity method  investments are carried at cost and then are adjusted to reflect our portion of increases and decreases in the net assets of the investee 
our investment in mail  inc was accounted for under the equity method until it was sold in february the gains we recognized upon the sale of our minority interest in mail  inc and when we subsequently received payments upon the release of funds pursuant to the terms of indemnification escrow agreements established at the time of sale are included in gain on sale of equity method investment 
our investment in mantas  inc has been accounted for under the equity method since its formation in may we are required to recognize our proportionate interest in mantas  inc s losses to the extent we have a cost basis in the investment on our balance sheet 
we have no cost basis in mantas  inc because we did not previously capitalize our internal investments in the mantas service offerings 
accordingly  we have not recognized any portion of mantas  inc s losses through june  
table of contents gain on sale of assentor practice in october  we sold our assentor practice for approximately million  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
all proceeds as a result of this sale were received in october upon closing 
other expense income the internal revenue service challenged our use of the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting for income taxes in while auditing our fiscal tax return 
other expense through june  reflects our historical provision for interest due on income taxes as a result of our use of this method 
through june   we accrued million as a reserve toward this contingency for what we then estimated to be our probable interest payments on this liability 
in february  we settled this matter with the internal revenue service and recorded other income in fiscal of approximately million  representing the amount by which the reserve exceeded our actual federal and estimated state interest payments of approximately  results of operations the following tables set forth some items from our consolidated statements of operations  and these items expressed as a percentage of revenue  for the periods indicated

the et segment revenue decreased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the revenue decline in this segment was due to reduced billings for professional services provided primarily to mantas  inc and our sale of the assentor practice in october cost of services for fiscal  total cost of services increased to million  from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  total cost of services decreased to for fiscal  from for fiscal the c si segment cost of services increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal  reflecting additional services provided primarily under new national security contract awards of approximately million and the cost of services incurred by acquired companies of approximately million 
as a percentage of c si revenue  c si cost of services decreased to for fiscal  from for fiscal this decrease as a percentage of c si revenue was attributable primarily to three factors 
first  we had a shift to services being provided under more profitable fixed price contracts  which decreases the ratio of cost of services to revenue 
second  we reduced the level of services provided by subcontractors relative to services being provided by our employees 
work performed by our employees is more profitable than subcontracted work  which decreases the ratio of cost of services to revenue 
third  our k contribution expense included in cost of services for the earlier period was higher than in fiscal  increasing the ratio of cost of services to revenue for fiscal the et segment cost of services decreased to  for fiscal  from million for fiscal  reflecting reduced billings for professional services provided primarily to mantas  inc and the sale of our assentor practice in october as a percentage of et revenue  et cost of services increased to for fiscal  from for fiscal

additionally  we increased our incremental spending on business development and proposal activities while constraining the cost growth of other corporate support functions 
the et segment selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to  for fiscal  from million for fiscal  reflecting the elimination of activities focused on the commercialization of technologies unrelated to our core c si client requirements and the sale of our assentor practice in october depreciation and amortization for fiscal  total depreciation and amortization increased by to million  from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  total depreciation and amortization was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal interest income expense  net for fiscal  interest income  net was million compared to interest expense  net of  for fiscal this improvement reflects reduced borrowings and increased cash and investment balances resulting from the proceeds received as a result of our may initial public offering and improved cash flows from operating activities 
gain on sale of equity method investment the gain on sale of equity method investment reflected in each period represents cash we received when indemnification escrows associated with the february sale of our interest in mail  inc were released 
gain on sale of assentor practice in october  we sold our assentor practice for approximately million  resulting in a net pre tax gain of million 
other income in february  we settled a matter with the internal revenue service and reversed previously established reserves of approximately million 
income taxes for fiscal  our effective income tax rate decreased to  from for fiscal this decrease was due primarily to lower nondeductible stock based compensation expenses and other nondeductible expenses for tax purposes in fiscal 
table of contents year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue for fiscal  total revenue increased to million  from million for fiscal the c si segment revenue increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal revenue growth in this segment resulted primarily from approximately million of revenue related to the acquisition of mng in january  approximately million of revenue related to new contract wins  including contracts with the national guard bureau  the office of the secretary of defense  and several contracts related to homeland security  and approximately million of revenue related to the expansion of services to the internal revenue service 
the et segment revenue decreased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the million of revenue for fiscal included million of revenue attributable to mantas service offerings 
following the formation of mantas  inc as a separate company in may  we have not consolidated its revenue or expenses 
for fiscal  more than of the revenue of the et segment related to licensing and maintenance of our proprietary software  primarily assentor

as a percentage of c si revenue  c si cost of services increased slightly to for fiscal  from for fiscal this increase as a percentage of c si revenue is attributable to higher stock based k contribution expense  a component of the fringe benefit expenses allocated to direct labor  in fiscal the et segment cost of services declined to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal  reflecting the formation of mantas  inc as a separate company

the et segment selling  general  and administrative expenses declined to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal  reflecting the formation of mantas  inc as a separate company 
as a percentage of et revenue  et selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to for fiscal  from for fiscal this increase was due to reduced client demand for our et products and services and the fact we did not reduce our staff proportionately during the period 
the lsi segment selling  general  and administrative expenses were million for fiscal we did not incur any lsi selling  general  and administrative expenses for fiscal because we closed the lsi segment as of december  
table of contents depreciation and amortization for fiscal  depreciation and amortization decreased by to million  from million for fiscal  reflecting reduced capital spending 
interest expense  net for fiscal  interest expense  net  decreased to  from  for fiscal this decrease reflects reduced borrowings and increased cash balances resulting from improved operating income and lower days sales outstanding in accounts receivable 
other expense income other expense was million for fiscal  reflecting our provision for probable interest due on income taxes as a result of the internal revenue service challenging our use of the cash method of accounting for income taxes 
on february   we settled this matter with the internal revenue service 
the interest and other settlement related expenses were less than the total million reserve we had accrued for this issue 
as a result  we reversed the excess reserve  recording other income in fiscal of million 
gain on sale of equity method investment for fiscal  we recognized a gain of  when we received cash from the release of an indemnification escrow related to the sale of our minority interest in mail  inc in february  we sold our interest in mail  inc and recognized a pre tax gain of million for fiscal during fiscal  we also reversed a  accrual for probable losses under funding commitments we had previously made to mail  inc income taxes for fiscal  our effective income tax rate increased to  from for fiscal this increase was due primarily to nondeductible stock based compensation expenses for tax purposes in fiscal seasonality our operating margin has typically been negatively affected in the quarter ending september by generally lower staff utilization rates 
these lower utilization rates are attributable both to summer vacations and to increased proposal activity in connection with the end of the federal fiscal year 
we typically transition a number of professional staff temporarily off of billable engagements to support this increased proposal activity 
this seasonality has not been transparent in our consolidated financial results for the periods presented  primarily because its effects have been impacted by other factors 
however  we expect to continue to experience this seasonality and our future periods may be materially affected by it 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs have historically been to finance the costs of operations pending the billing and collection of accounts receivable  to acquire capital assets  to invest in research and development  and to repurchase our stock from our employees as part of an internal stock repurchase program we maintained as a privately held company 
we have historically relied on cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility for liquidity 
in may  we completed an initial public offering that resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in june  we completed a follow on offering that resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
as a public company focused on growing our core c si business  we expect our future liquidity needs will be primarily to finance the costs of operations pending the billing and collection of 
table of contents accounts receivable  to acquire capital assets  and to make selected strategic acquisitions 
as a public company  repurchasing stock from employees is no longer a liquidity requirement as we have discontinued our internal stock repurchase program 
we expect the combination of cash flows from operations  our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  and the available borrowing capacity under our credit facility to meet our normal operating liquidity and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our operating cash flow is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts  our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner  and our ability to manage our vendor payments 
our ability to borrow funds is generally related to the level of receivables we have due from clients and the amount of cash flow we generate from our operating activities 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million as of june  up from million as of june  we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility as of either june  or june  accounts receivable represent our largest working capital requirement 
we typically bill our clients monthly after services are rendered 
cash flow net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended june   an increase of million from the year ended june  this increase in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to higher net income and increased tax benefits of stock option exercises  offset by changes in various working capital accounts and a significant reduction in deferred tax liabilities in fiscal that resulted when we converted from the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting for income taxes to the accrual method 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended june   an increase of million from fiscal this increase in investing cash outflows was primarily due to the acquisition of adroit and payment of the mng earn out 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended june   a decrease of million from the year ended june  this decrease in financing cash inflows was primarily due to lower net proceeds received from the follow on offering in june compared to the net proceeds received from our initial public offering in may net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal this decrease in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to the payment of deferred taxes and accounts payable  offset by improved operating income and the more rapid collection of accounts receivable 
net cash used by investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to  provided by investing activities for fiscal this change was primarily due to cash used to acquire the marasco newton group ltd

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  short and long term investments  and accounts receivable 
we believe that concentrations of credit risk with respect to cash equivalents and investments are limited due to the high credit quality of these investments 
our investment policy requires that investments be in direct obligations of the us government  certain us government sponsored entities  investments that are secured by direct or sponsored us government obligations  or municipal obligations rated at least aa by both moody s investor service and standard and poors 
our policy does not allow investment in any equity securities or the obligations of any entity under review for possible downgrade by a major rating service 
investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted because of a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value because of changes in 
table of contents interest rates 
investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
under this policy  no investment securities may have maturities exceeding two years and the average duration of the portfolio cannot exceed nine months 
we believe that concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited as they are primarily federal government receivables 
as of june  and  the carrying value of financial instruments approximated fair value 
to the extent borrowings are outstanding under our credit facility  we have some interest rate risk based on the variable interest rate of our revolving credit facility 
average borrowings under our revolving credit facility were not material in fiscal or fiscal
