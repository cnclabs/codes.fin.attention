item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company sold its hydraulic cylinder division in january the company s consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the years ended january  and separately present the historical results of the hydraulic cylinder division as a discontinued operation 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an on going basis  including those related to uncollectible receivables  inventories  goodwill and long lived assets  warranty obligations  environmental liabilities and deferred taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on accounts and notes receivable resulting from the inability of its customers and note holders to make required payments 
such allowances are based on an ongoing review of customer and note holder payments against terms and a review of customer and note holder financial statements and financial information 
if the financial condition of customers or the note holders were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company maintains reserves to write down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would result in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of income being greater than expected in the period in which more information becomes available 
intangible assets the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on accounting for business combinations and goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill from acquisitions 
the company continues to amortize other acquisition related intangibles  which are not significant to the company s consolidated balance sheet 
as of january  the company has million of goodwill 
in conjunction with the implementation of sfas  the company completed a transitional impairment test in the quarter ended april  and found no impairment 
as required by sfas  the company must perform a similar impairment test annually  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
certain factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the company s overall business and significant industry or economic trends 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future sales  sales growth rates  gross margins  expense and capital expenditure levels  the discount rate and estimated terminal values to determine the fair value of the operating entities should an impairment exist 
changes in these and other factors could result in impairments in the carrying value of goodwill  which would require a write down or further write downs to the asset s fair value 
the company performed the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and found no impairment 
warranty obligations the company offers certain warranties with the sales of its products 
the warranty obligation is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet and is estimated through historical customer claims  product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
changes in these factors and changes in statutory requirements for product warranties in markets in which the company sells its products would require an adjustment to the recorded warranty obligations 
environmental liabilities the company accrues environmental remediation and litigation costs if it is probable a liability has been incurred at the financial statement date and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the reliability and precision of the estimates are affected by numerous factors  such as site evaluation and reevaluation of the degree of remediation required  claims by third parties and changes to environmental laws and regulations 
the company adjusts its liabilities as new remediation requirements are defined  as information becomes available permitting reasonable estimates to be made and to reflect new facts 
deferred taxes the company s provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of management judgment 
the company is subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the taxes paid to these jurisdictions are subject to audit  although to date the results of any tax audits have been minor 
judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carryforwards  will not be realized 
as of january  the company has established a valuation allowance against various deferred tax assets 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the company continually evaluates strategies that could allow the future utilization of its deferred tax assets 
benefit plans the company makes a number of assumptions with regard to both future financial conditions and future actions by participants to calculate on an actuarial basis the amount of income or expense and assets and liabilities recognized in association with the company s defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
these assumptions include the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  health care cost trend rates and expected rates of retirement for plan participants 
the company reviews the assumptions on an annual basis and makes changes to reflect market conditions and the administration of the plans 
while the company believes the current assumptions are appropriate in the circumstances  actual results and changes in these assumptions in the future will result in adjustments which impact the income or expense recognized in future years in relation to these plans
