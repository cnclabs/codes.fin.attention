item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to recruit and retain qualified personnel 
we depend upon our ability to attract and retain personnel  particularly technical and professional personnel  who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our clients 
we must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies 
we expect competition for individuals with proven technical or professional skills for the foreseeable future 
if qualified personnel are not available to us in sufficient numbers and upon economic terms acceptable to us  it could have a material detrimental effect on our business 
our current market share may decrease as a result of limited barriers to entry by new competitors and our clients discontinuation of outsourcing their staffing needs 
we face significant competition in the markets we serve  and there are limited barriers to entry by new competitors 
the competition among staffing services firms is intense 
we compete for potential clients with providers of outsourcing services  systems integrators  computer systems consultants  other providers of staffing services  temporary personnel agencies  and search firms 
a number of our competitors possess substantially greater resources than we do 
from time to time we have experienced significant pressure from our clients to reduce price levels 
during these periods  we may face increased competitive pricing pressures and may not be able to recruit the personnel necessary to fill our clients needs 
we also face the risk that certain of our current and prospective clients will decide to provide similar services internally 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully compete 
we rely on short term contracts with most of our clients 
because long term contracts are not a significant part of our business  future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 
decreases in patient occupancy at our healthcare clients facilities may adversely affect the profitability of our business 
demand for our temporary healthcare staffing services is significantly affected by the general level of patient occupancy at our healthcare clients facilities 
when a hospital s occupancy increases  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
as occupancy decreases  clients may reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their regular employees 
we also may experience more competitive pricing pressure during periods of occupancy downturn 
this reduction in occupancy could adversely affect the demand for our services and our profitability 

table of contents competition for acquisition opportunities may restrict our future growth by limiting our ability to make acquisitions at reasonable valuations 
our business strategy includes increasing our market share and presence in the staffing industry through strategic acquisitions of companies that complement or enhance our business 
we have historically faced competition for acquisitions 
in the future  this could limit our ability to grow by acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less accretive or non accretive to us 
in addition  if we are unable to secure necessary financing to consummate an acquisition  we may be unable to complete desirable acquisitions 
we may face difficulties integrating our acquisitions into our operations and our acquisitions may be unsuccessful  involve significant cash expenditures or expose us to unforeseen liabilities 
we continually evaluate opportunities to acquire staffing companies that complement or enhance our business and frequently have preliminary acquisition discussions with some of these companies 
these acquisitions involve numerous risks  including potential loss of key employees or clients of acquired companies  difficulties integrating acquired personnel and distinct cultures into our business  diversion of management attention from existing operations  and assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies 
these acquisitions may also involve significant cash expenditures  debt incurrence and integration expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business and financial condition 
we depend on the proper functioning of our information systems 
we are dependent on the proper functioning of our information systems in operating our business 
our critical information systems used in our daily operations identify and match staffing resources and client assignments and perform billing and accounts receivable functions 
our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards and we have backup remote processing capabilities 
they are still vulnerable  however  to hurricanes  other storms  flood  fire  terrorist acts  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  physical or software break ins  computer viruses and similar events 
if our critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable  we would have to accomplish these functions manually  which could temporarily impact our ability to identify business opportunities quickly  to maintain billing and clinical records reliably  and to bill for services efficiently 
in addition  we depend on third party vendors for certain functions whose future performance and reliability we can not warranty 
our success depends upon retaining the services of our management team 
we are highly dependent on our management team 
we expect that our continued success will largely depend upon the efforts and abilities of members of our management team 
the loss of services of any key executive for any reason could have a material adverse effect upon us 
our success also depends upon our ability to identify  develop  and retain qualified operating employees  particularly management  client servicing  and candidate recruiting employees 
we expend significant resources in recruiting and training our employees  and the pool of available applicants for these positions is limited 
the loss of some of our operating management and client servicing and candidate recruiting employees could have an adverse effect on our operations  including our ability to establish and maintain client  candidate and professional and technical personnel relationships 
we face significant employment liability risk 
we employ and place people in the workplaces of other businesses 
an inherent risk of such activity includes possible claims of errors and omissions  misuse of client proprietary information  misappropriation of funds  discrimination and harassment  employment of illegal aliens  theft of client property  other criminal activity  or torts and other 
table of contents claims 
we have policies and guidelines in place to reduce our exposure to such risks 
however  failure of any employee or personnel to follow these policies and guidelines may result in negative publicity  injunctive relief  and the payment by us of monetary damages or fines  or have other material adverse effects upon our business 
moreover  we could be held responsible for the actions at a workplace of persons not under our immediate control 
to reduce our exposure  we maintain insurance covering general liability  workers compensation claims  errors and omissions  and employee theft 
due to the nature of our assignments  in particular  access to client information systems and confidential information  and the potential liability with respect thereto  we might not be able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts adequate to cover any such liability on acceptable terms 
in addition  we face various employment related risks not covered by insurance  such as wage laws and employment tax responsibility significant legal actions  particularly relating to our healthcare staffing services  could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities 
in recent years  healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging malpractice  product liability or related legal theories 
many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs 
in addition  we may be subject to claims related to torts or crimes committed by our employees or temporary staffing personnel 
in some instances  we are required to indemnify clients against some or all of these risks 
a failure of any of our employees or personnel to observe our policies and guidelines intended to reduce these risks  relevant client policies and guidelines or applicable federal  state or local laws  rules and regulations could result in negative publicity  payment of fines or other damages 
to protect ourselves from the cost of these claims  we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations 
our insurance coverage  however  may not cover all claims against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost 
if we are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage  we may be exposed to substantial liabilities 
currently we are unable to recruit enough nurses to meet our clients demands for our nurse staffing services  limiting the potential growth of our healthcare staffing business 
we rely on our ability to attract  develop  and retain nurses and other healthcare personnel who possess the skills  experience and  as required  licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our healthcare staffing clients 
we compete for healthcare staffing personnel with other temporary healthcare staffing companies  as well as actual and potential clients  some of which seek to fill positions with either regular or temporary employees 
currently  there is a shortage of qualified nurses in most areas of the united states and competition for nursing personnel is increasing 
at this time we do not have enough nurses to meet our clients demands for our nurse staffing services 
this shortage of nurses limits our ability to grow our healthcare staffing business 
furthermore  we believe that the aging of the existing nurse population and declining enrollments in nursing schools will result in further competition for qualified nursing personnel 

table of contents if we become subject to material liabilities under our self insured programs  our financial results may be adversely affected 
we provide workers compensation coverage through a program that is partially self insured 
in addition  we provide medical coverage to our employees through a partially self insured preferred provider organization 
if we become subject to substantial uninsured workers compensation or medical coverage liabilities  our financial results may be adversely affected 
we may be adversely affected by government regulation of the staffing business 
our business is subject to regulation and licensing in many states 
while we have had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material 
if we fail to comply such failure could materially adversely affect kforce 
we may be adversely affected by government regulation of the workplace 
part of our business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in client s workplaces 
increase government regulation of the workplace or of the employer employee relationship could materially adversely affect us 
adverse results in tax audits could result in significant cash expenditures or exposure to unforeseen liabilities 
we are subject to periodic federal  state and local income tax audits for various tax years 
although the company attempts to comply with all taxing authority regulations  adverse findings or assessments made by the taxing authorities as the result of an audit could materially adversely affect us 
future changes in reimbursement trends could hamper our clients ability to pay us 
many of our healthcare clients are reimbursed under the federal medicare program and state medicaid programs for the services they provide 
in recent years  federal and state governments have made significant changes in these programs that have reduced government rates 
in addition  insurance companies and managed care organizations seek to control costs by requiring that healthcare providers  such as hospitals  discount their services in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plans 
future federal and state legislation or evolving commercial reimbursement trends may further reduce  or change conditions for  our clients reimbursement 
limitations on reimbursement could reduce our clients cash flow  hampering their ability to pay us 
this situation could have a significant impact on our cash flow 
our stock price may be volatile 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol kfrc 
the market price of our stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future  based on a variety of factors  including our operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets  the employment services industry  or other developments affecting us  our clients  or our competitors  some of which may be unrelated to our performance 
those fluctuations and demand for our services may adversely affect the price of our stock 
it is possible that the stock price may reach a level where we lose our eligibility to remain listed on nasdaq 
in addition  the stock market in general  especially the nasdaq national market tier along with market prices for staffing companies  have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating results 
among other things  volatility in our stock price could mean that investors will not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices which they pay 
the volatility also could impair our ability in the future to offer common stock as a source of additional capital or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses 

table of contents significant increases in payroll related costs could adversely affect our business 
we are required to pay a number of federal  state  and local payroll and related costs  including unemployment taxes  workers compensation and insurance  fica  and medicare  among others  for our employees and personnel 
significant increases in the effective rates of any payroll related costs likely would have a material adverse effect upon us 
our costs could also increase as a result of health care reforms or the possible imposition of additional requirements and restrictions related to the placement of personnel 
recent federal and state legislative proposals have included provisions extending health insurance benefits to personnel who currently do not receive such benefits 
we may not be able to increase the fees charged to our clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs  if any such proposals are adopted 
provisions in our articles  bylaws  and under florida law may have certain anti takeover effects 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws and florida law contain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a non negotiated merger or other business combination 
in particular  our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board of directors and permit the removal of directors only for cause 
additionally  management may issue up to million shares of preferred stock  and fix the rights and preferences thereof  without a further vote of the shareholders 
in addition  certain of our officers have employment agreements containing certain provisions that call for substantial payments to be made to such officers upon any change in control 
certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of kforce  including an acquisition in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
as a result  shareholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so 
moreover  the existence of these provisions may have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock 
item properties we lease our corporate headquarters in tampa  florida  as well as space for our other locations 
the aggregate area of office space under leases for locations is approximately  square feet 
field office leases generally run from month to month to five years 
in september  we relocated our corporate offices and local branches into a new headquarters in tampa  florida  which we have leased for years 
the aggregate annual rent expense in on all properties was approximately million 
we believe that our facilities will be adequate for our current needs 
we own a parcel of vacant land adjacent to the site of our new corporate headquarters for which we have no current plans to develop 
item legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business  we are  from time to time  threatened with or named as a defendant in various lawsuits  including discrimination claims  restrictive covenant disputes  service related disputes and other claims 
we maintain insurance in such amounts and with such coverages and deductibles as management believes are reasonable 
the principal risks that we insure against are workers compensation  personal injury  bodily injury  property damage  professional malpractice  errors and omissions  employment practices liability and fidelity losses 
we are not aware of any litigation that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

overview we are a provider of professional and technical specialty staffing services in over markets in the united states of america 
we provide our customers staffing services in the following specialties information technology  finance and accounting  and health and life sciences  pharmaceutical  scientific  nursing and business office

critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that our following accounting policies fit this definition revenue recognition net service revenues consist of flexible billings inclusive of billable expenses and search fees net of credits  discounts and fallouts 
the company recognizes flexible billings based on hours worked by assigned personnel on a weekly basis 
search fees are recognized upon placement  net of an allowance for fallouts 
fallouts are search placements that do not complete the contingency period 
contingency periods are typically less than ninety days 
allowance for doubtful accounts and fallouts the company has established a reserve for expected credit losses and fallouts on trade receivables based on our past experience and expectations of potential future write offs 
as a result of an ongoing analysis of factors including recent write off trends  changes in 
table of contents economic conditions  and concentration of accounts receivables among clients  we have increased the allowance as percentage of gross accounts receivable by  from as of december  to as of december  as of december   no single client has a receivable balance greater than of total accounts receivable and the largest ten clients represent approximately of the total accounts receivable balance 
it is possible that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of accounts receivable changes over time 
this is especially true if the economy continues to deteriorate 
we continually review and refine the estimation process to make it as reactive to these changes as possible 
we cannot  however  predict accurately estimated credit losses on these accounts receivable 
income taxes the company s losses have resulted in net operating loss carryforwards for which the company has recorded a deferred tax asset 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that unless it is more likely than not a deferred tax asset can be utilized to offset future taxes  a valuation allowance must be recorded against that asset 
as a result of pre tax losses in the last two years we do not have presumptive evidence of future profitability  therefore  the company has recorded a valuation allowance on its net current and non current deferred tax asset 
as of december   net current and non current deferred tax assets are reflected net of this valuation allowance on the consolidated balance sheet 
accrued commissions placement associates earn commissions as a percentage of actual revenue or gross profit pursuant to a calendar year basis commission plan 
for each placement associate  the amount of commissions paid as a percentage of revenue or gross profit increases as sales volume levels increase 
the company accrues commission for actual sales at a percentage equal to the percent of total expected commissions payable to total sales in the year 
impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which became effective for the company as of january   the company periodically reviews the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment has occurred 
impairment losses  if any  are recorded in the period identified 
significant judgment is required to determine whether or not impairment has occurred 
the determination is made by evaluating expected future undiscounted cash flows or the anticipated recoverability of costs incurred and  if necessary  determining the amount of the loss  if any  by evaluating the fair value of the assets 
goodwill on june   the financial accounting standards board unanimously approved the issuance of two statements  sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas prohibits the use of pooling of interest method for business combinations initiated after june  and also applies to all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method that were completed after june  sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in an entity s statement of financial position at that date  regardless of when the assets were initially recognized 
effective january   the company discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
we have completed the assessment of sfas and sfas impact on financial position and results of operations 
as a result of this assessment  the company recorded an impairment charge of million 
the impairment charge is classified as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  stock based compensation the company has elected to continue accounting for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation as provided under apb no 
and has disclosed pro forma net income and earnings loss per share amounts using the fair value based method prescribed by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of 
table of contents america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net service revenues  certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the indicated periods year ended december  revenue by segment information technology finance accounting health life sciences net service revenues revenue by time flexible billings search fees net service revenues gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses loss income before income taxes net loss before change in accounting principle net loss net service revenues 
net service revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  decreasing by during and by during we believe the decreases in all business unit search fees and in flexible billings for information technology and finance and accounting are primarily due to continued deterioration in overall economic conditions 
the net increase in flexible billings for health and life sciences is partially attributable to business acquisitions and disposals made in december  which contributed an approximate million net increase in revenue for in addition  during  the company closed or sold various businesses in its information technology segment that contributed million and million in revenues for the and the changes by segment and revenue type are as follows in thousands net percent net percent net service increase service increase service revenue decrease revenue decrease revenue information technology flex revenue search revenue total information technology finance and accounting flexible revenue search revenue total finance and accounting

total hours billed decreased to million hours in from million hours in and decreased in from million hours in the average bill rate decreased by to in from in and decreased from in billable expenses decreased in to million from million in offsetting a portion of the growth of in from million in the decrease in is attributable to a decrease in the information technology segment s billable expenses 
the increase in billable expenses in is primarily attributable to the growth in the health and life sciences segment which typically has a higher proportion of billable expenses than the other segments 
health and life sciences flexible billings have continued to grow in and this increase is offset by the decreases in flexible billings in the finance and accounting segment and information technology segment 
these results are primarily attributable to the generally prevailing unfavorable economic conditions 
effective january   the company reclassified reimbursable billable expenses to revenue based on the issuance of an abstract from the emerging issues task force  issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
historically  the reimbursements were classified as a reduction of direct costs of services 
the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss have been adjusted to reflect the effects of this reclassification 
billable expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the billable expenses are reflected within flexible billings 
search fees 
search fees decreases are primarily attributable to the continued decrease in the number of placements 
total placements decreased to  placements in from  in and decreased from  placements in decreases of in and in the average placement fee also contributed to the results 
we believe these results are primarily attributable to the generally prevailing unfavorable economic conditions 
gross profit 
gross profit on flexible billings is determined by deducting the direct cost of services primarily flexible personnel payroll wages  payroll taxes  payroll related insurance  and subcontract costs from net service revenues 
consistent with industry practices  gross profit dollars from search fees are equal to revenues  because there are generally no direct costs associated with such revenues 
gross profit decreased to million in and decreased to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of net service revenues decreased to in compared to in and in the decrease in gross profit percentage in and as compared to  was primarily the result of a shift in business mix away from search fees 
in addition  bill rates  particularly in the information technology segment  have declined at a faster rate than pay rates 
each of the changes is negatively impacting gross profit percentages 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in  and  respectively  decreasing by during and during selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net service revenues decreased to in and in compared to for the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as compared to prior year is primarily due to a decrease in 
table of contents commissions and other compensation relating to the decrease in revenue  the benefits obtained from initiatives taken to re engineer and streamline back office operations and reductions in other selling  general and administrative expenses to better align expenses with revenue 
in  selling  general and administrative expense continued to be impacted by realignment of the field organization for greater customer focus and alignment of operating costs and balance sheet accounts with the company s decreased revenue base 
the costs included i million  including a million cancellation fee  to change our outsourced data center vendor  ii million in severance costs associated with management changes  and iii million in impairment losses on capitalized software 
selling  general and administrative costs in  included i million for severance costs associated with the planned reduction in field associates and management as well as corporate and administrative personnel  ii million for impairment losses on capitalized software  iii million of costs for consolidation of offices and iv a million loss on the sale of our training business 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing and decreases during and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net service revenue decreased to in from for and for the decrease in expense in as compared to was primarily due to the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill in accordance with sfas which the company implemented on january   decreased amortization of computer software relating to impairment charges that reduce the carrying value of capital software in and  and the decrease in the amount of owned assets 
goodwill amortization for each of the years ended december  and was million 
other expense 
other expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in the expense in resulted from the decrease in interest expense due to the reduction of debt balance and a reduction in loss on the disposal of assets 
the increase in the loss in is primarily a result of interest payments on the december credit facility borrowings for the repurchase of million of common shares  as well as an increase in the loss on disposal of assets related to the alignment of operating costs and balance sheet accounts to the declining revenue base 
loss income before income taxes and accounting change 
the loss income before income taxes of million in  million in and million in  is primarily the result of changes in net service revenues and gross margin and reduced selling  general and administrative expenses discussed above 
benefit provision for income taxes 
the income tax provision for was million  the income tax benefit for was million  and the income tax provision for was million 
the effective tax provision rate was in  the effective tax benefit rate was in and the effective tax provision rate was in the effective tax rate of is due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax benefit of federal and state net operating losses 
the income tax benefit in is due to the net operating losses for those years 
the effective tax rate in was high primarily due to the non deductibility of amortization of goodwill and of meals and entertainment expenses 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the company has adopted sfas as of january  sfas requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
as a result of this impairment test  the company recorded an impairment of approximately million  consisting of million and million for the human resources and the information technology units  respectively  which is classified as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended december  subsequent impairments  if any  will be classified as an operating expense 
conditions contributing to the goodwill impairment are negative industry and economic trends which have lowered profits and cash flows over the last months and which continue to impact earnings forecasts 
net loss 
the net loss was million in  million for and million for the losses were primarily the result of those items discussed above 

table of contents the company continues to evaluate its operating costs and balance sheet accounts to the extent its revenue base declines 
costs for the consolidation of offices  severance and streamlining of operations and impairment of assets and goodwill  could negatively affect net income in future years 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity include approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in additional net working capital 
in addition  we have approximately million outstanding under the million amended and restated credit facility with a syndicate of four banks lead by bank of america the credit facility 
this credit facility  which was amended on december   terminates november  the credit facility provides for a maximum revolving credit facility of million not to exceed of our eligible receivables as such term is defined in the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by all of the assets of kforce and its subsidiaries 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at rates ranging from prime to prime plus or libor plus to libor plus  pursuant to certain financial performance targets as set forth in the credit facility 
pricing is fixed for one year at libor plus 
after one year  pricing changes quarterly based on the previous four quarters performance 
under the terms of the credit facility  we are prohibited from making any dividend distributions 
the terms of the credit facility also include certain financial covenants should the total amount borrowed under the credit facility exceed specified amounts 
these financial covenants include measurement of quarterly ebitda as compared to our ebitda projections 
our borrowings as of march  and december  do not exceed the specified amounts at which these financial covenants apply and at no time during the history of the credit facility have we triggered such covenants 
the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock on the open market  from time to time  depending on market conditions 
the credit facility contains a provision that allows kforce to repurchase million of common stock per year 
as of december   we had repurchased approximately million shares for million under this plan 
approximately million was available under current board authorization and million was available under the current credit facility limitations as of december  and march   respectively 
additional stock repurchases may have a material impact on the cash flow requirements for the next twelve months 
the credit facility also contains a provision that limits the amount of capital expenditures that kforce may make in any fiscal year to million 
total capital expenditures in were million 
in april  we entered into two fixed interest rate swap contracts in relation to a portion of the credit facility for a total notional amount of million with terms expiring no later than may effective october   we obtained a lower interest rate and extended the expiration date to october on million of the swap contracts 
the contracts  which were classified as cash flow hedges  effectively convert a portion of our outstanding debt under the credit facility to a fixed rate basis  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future income 
the differential between floating rate receipts and fixed rate payments is accrued as market rates fluctuate and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense

there is no assurance i that we will be able to obtain financing in amounts sufficient to meet operating requirements or at terms which are satisfactory and which allow us to remain competitive  or ii that we will be able to meet the financial covenants contained in the credit facility 
if we currently had borrowed sufficient funds to trigger the financial covenants in the credit facility  we would not be in compliance with such covenants 
our expectation that existing resources will fund working capital requirements is a forward looking statement that is subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ from those indicated as a result of a number of factors  including the use of such resources for possible acquisitions and the announced stock repurchase plan
