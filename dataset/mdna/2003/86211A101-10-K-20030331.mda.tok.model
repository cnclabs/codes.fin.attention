item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of  section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of contain certain safe harbors regarding forward looking statements 
from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by our directors  officers or employees may contain forward looking information subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
any statements made herein that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements including  but not limited to  statements concerning the characteristics and growth of our markets and customers  our objectives and plans for future operations and products and our expected liquidity and capital resources 
such forward looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and involve a number of risks and uncertainties  and  accordingly  actual results could differ materially 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to the continued and future acceptance of our products  the rate of growth in the industries of our products  the presence of competitors with greater technical  marketing and financial resources  our ability to promptly and effectively respond to technological change to meet evolving customer needs  risks associated with sales in foreign countries  and our ability to successfully expand our operations 
introduction this discussion summarizes the significant accounting policies  accounting estimates and other significant factors affecting the liquidity  capital resources and results of operations of the company for the three year period ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
our management is also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves for lower of cost or market adjustments  excess quantities and discontinued products  estimated lives and impairment of tangible and intangible long life assets  restructuring costs  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment  provided that the price is fixed and determinable  no significant obligations remain  collectibility is probable and returns are estimable 
revenue is recognized at the time of shipment since the terms of shipment are fob shipping point and legal title to the equipment passes to the customer at this time 
we consider post shipment obligations such as installation and training to be relatively insignificant given the underlying nature of the equipment and of its installation 
revenue from services is recognized over the contract period or as services are provided 
revenue from license fees is 
table of contents recognized over the contract period or when received for fully paid license agreements 
these revenue accounting policies do not require significant estimates by management 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets all of our goodwill and other intangibles resulted from our acquisition of cyberstorage systems in that was accounted for using the purchase method 
in connection with the implementation of sfas and as of january   we have ceased amortizing goodwill and determined that our entire business constitutes one reporting unit for purposes of assessing potential impairment of goodwill 
a fair value approach was used to test existing goodwill for impairment 
the effective date of the fair value determinations for the impairment of goodwill was september  due to several triggering events including an unfavorable decision in patent litigation in the uk high court  london  a decline in our stock price of approximately during august  and a reorganization of our management team to refocus our efforts on the storage wide area networking swan market during august the market approach was the method used to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
under the fair value approach  the quoted market prices in active securities markets are used as the basis for the determination of fair value 
the fair value used for measuring impairment indicated by our stock price was also supplemented by the valuations indicated by a portfolio of comparable publicly traded companies 
this valuation approach resulted in the determination of a goodwill impairment charge of  in accordance with sfas no 
as of september  additionally  in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluated the carrying values of our identifiable intangible assets based on the same triggering events discussed above 
we determined an impairment existed for the portion of intangible assets representing customer relationships acquired from cyberstorage systems in accordingly  an impairment of identifiable intangible assets in the amount of  has been recorded as of september  stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation plans under accounting principles board apb opinion no  accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly account for employee stock based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method 
sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation  established a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans 
we have adopted the disclosure only alternative under sfas no  which requires disclosure of the pro forma effects on earnings and earnings per share as if sfas no 
had been adopted as well as certain other information 
in december  the fasb issued fasb no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 

this statement amends fasb no 
 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  fasb no 
amends the disclosure requirements of fasb no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
fasb no 
also requires that those effects be disclosed more prominently by specifying the form  content  and location of those disclosures 
we have adopted the increased disclosure requirements of fasb no 
for the fiscal year ended december  we will continue to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 

table of contents the additional disclosures required by fasb no 
are as follows december  net loss applicable to common stockholders  as reported add stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss applicable to common stockholders  net of tax deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method of all awards  net of tax pro forma net loss applicable to common stockholders net loss applicable to common stockholders per basic and dilutive shares as reported pro forma allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible which are determined based on historical experience and our assessment of the general financial conditions affecting our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowance may be required 
we have a limited number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in one of those customer s credit worthiness or other matters affecting the collectibility of amounts due from such customers  could have a material affect on our results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
restructuring costs during  we recorded significant restructuring accruals in connection with the integration of our acquisition of cyberstorage systems into our existing business 
these accruals included estimated costs to settle certain contractual obligations  personnel related costs for benefit programs and redundancy  and charges related to excess inventory quantities and parts for discontinued products 
the majority of our estimates were based on reasonably determinable facts and circumstances and our actual costs incurred were consistent with our estimates 
during the fourth quarter of  additional reserves were provided for inventories related to discontinued products 
in august  we announced a realignment and refocus of our core business activity toward the storage wide area networking swan market segment 
we have also temporarily closed our operations in europe 
additional reserves were provided for excess inventory quantities and inventories of discontinued products because of these actions 
intellectual property rights  contingencies and litigation we have a substantial portfolio of patents  claims and other intellectual property rights 
costs and expenses in connection with the development of and the enforcement of our rights are expensed when incurred 
certain contingent fees for legal services are due upon the receipt of license fees over contract periods or upon receipt of payment for paid up license arrangements 
we currently are in legal proceedings in connection with the enforcement of our intellectual property rights the results of which cannot be predicted 
our failure to successfully enforce our patent rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in the normal course of our business  we are subject to various other proceedings  lawsuits and claims relating to product  technology  labor and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
the amount of loss accrual  if any  is 
table of contents determined after careful analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted by new developments or revised strategies 
we believe that none of the existing matters will result in a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources our future success depends on maintaining adequate liquidity and working capital to meet our operational requirements 
on may   we completed a million financing through a private placement of common stock to a group of four european and us based institutional investors 
in that financing  we sold  shares of common stock at per share and issued  warrants to purchase common stock at per share that are exercisable over a five year period 
in addition  in october   we received million from a license fee for our intellectual property 
despite this recent success  revenues from products and services have fallen dramatically and there can be no assurances that we will be able to secure additional license fees of this magnitude or at all during the coming twelve months 
furthermore  given the continued volatility of the global securities markets and  in particular  the market for the securities of technology companies  as well as the recent results of our pending legal actions concerning enforcement of our intellectual property rights  we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing 
our failure to maintain adequate liquidity and working capital would have a material adverse effect on the company  our financial condition and our results of operations 
we incurred operating losses through and we continue to incur operating losses at this time 
while the development and introduction of our new products continues  our actual sales revenue has declined significantly over the last year and continues to be at a low level 
in response in  we have reduced our activity level in marketing  sales and administration and implemented cost reduction programs primarily in employee headcount  the use of independent software subcontractors and the level of expenses for development  travel and administration 
management believes  although there can be no assurances  that our currently available working capital and the cash flow from our operations in will support our operating plan for the next twelve months 
our operating plan and related cash flow projections for have been forecasted by management anticipating only a base level of revenue from sales of our new products to new and existing customers and product upgrades  replacement parts and maintenance services from our existing customer base 
we have not included any potential revenues from license fee activities 
we have projected our costs and expenses using our current level of operating expenses for our core business activity and only the minimum requirements for the defense of our intellectual property 
if our projected levels of revenues from products and services are not achieved or are delayed in their realization  management has plans that can be implemented to further reduce the operating expense cash flow requirements to allow the company to continue in business 
these include reductions in salary levels similar to those that were achieved during through a compensation deferral  stock based compensation plan or  in the alternative  additional reductions in staffing headcount 
cost reductions of other non employee related costs  primarily expenses for rent and other facilities occupancy expenses  would also be implemented 
in addition  while the dilutive effect might be significant  the company continues to receive inquires from interested investors to provide equity financing using a variety of alternatives 
we continue to explore strategic alliance opportunities to market our new products that would also provide financial support 
although there can be no assurances  management is committed to achieving or exceeding its base operating plan for and intends to implement those cost reductions and improvements in cash flow to achieve this success

cash flows used in operations increased in due to increased operating losses and continued increases in working capital accounts  excluding cash  that were partially offset by the net effect of an increase in amortization of intangible assets  non cash compensation for services  a reduced provision for restructuring cost and a reduction in the provision for deferred taxes

our foreign subsidiaries obligations to their parent are denominated in united states dollars 
there is a potential for a foreign currency gain or loss based upon fluctuations between the united states dollar and our subsidiaries functional currencies  currently the eurodollar and the british pound

table of contents our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may in the future fluctuate significantly  depending upon a variety of factors 
after the acquisition of cyberstorage systems corporation in september  we commenced a corporate wide restructuring  including the expansion of our north america sales territories to seven regions  the initiation of a plan to re establish our re seller sales channel  consolidation of our european sales  marketing and service organizations  and implemented strategic marketing initiatives and programs for product development and repositioning 
although we believed these actions and the introduction of our new products in would provide the revenue growth that would enable us to return to profitability  this has not materialized 
currently  the poor economic climate for the storage sector and technology products in general have required us to cut back our core business operations to preserve working capital 
we have also temporarily closed our operations in europe 
in and  license fees as a percentage of revenue increased significantly as the result of two fully paid up license agreements described more fully under revenue below 
revenue revenues from sales of products and services decreased during as a result of a significant decline in market demand for our products and services and restructuring of our internal sales and marketing organization 
revenues from sales of products and services increased only slightly in and consisted primarily of legacy raid products and the cyber products existing at the time that cyberstorage systems was acquired 
we expect future sales to come primarily from our new product lines described in item of this annual report 
revenues from license fees with respect to our patents and other intellectual properties began in with the settlement of our claims against xiotech corporation and its parent company  seagate technology  inc pursuant to that settlement  we entered into a license agreement with xiotech under which we agreed to grant to xiotech a non exclusive  fully paid up license in and to certain of our patents in return for a one time royalty payment of  during  we entered into a non exclusive patent license agreement with a subsidiary of emc and received a million one time royalty payment for a fully paid up  worldwide  non exclusive  perpetual license for all of the licensee s products that may be subject to any claim in any of our patents 
because each of these license agreements are fully paid up  such arrangements will not provide a recurring source of future revenue 
we currently are in legal proceedings in connection with the enforcement of our patents and other intellectual property rights  the results of which cannot be predicted 
in connection with one such action  we have entered into an agreement with hitachi  ltd 
with respect to our intellectual property which  depending on the outcome of such litigation  could provide the company with potential additional license revenue 
see item legal proceedings 
our failure to successfully enforce our patent rights and receive revenue from license fees could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
revenues by geographic region expressed as a percentage of total revenues is as follows year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  north america asia europe other regions the shift in revenue from through resulted from a reduction in the european direct sales force and increased revenues from license fees in north america in and 
table of contents for the year ended december   product sales of  to one customer were in excess of of revenue 
in addition  a license fee of  received from a subsidiary of emc during the year ended december  and a license fee of  received from xiotech corporation during the year ended december   each represented in excess of of total consolidated revenues in those years 
all united states export sales are denominated in united states dollars to limit the amount of foreign currency risk 
cost of products and services costs of products and services decreased  in due to reductions in overhead costs  reduced manufacturing activity and additional staffing reductions 
cost of products and services decreased  in due to our lower level of manufacturing activity  the shift to our new product lines and staffing reductions in our factory 
included in costs of products and services were writedowns of inventory in the amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively  in connection with the restructuring of our business and discontinued product lines 
gross profit loss gross profit on the sale of products and services is summarized as follows in thousands except for of sales amounts gross profit loss restructuring costs included in the cost of products and services gross profits were reduced in and primarily due to provisions for restructuring costs associated with excess inventory quantities and inventories related to discontinued products 
cost of license fees costs associated with the enforcement of our patent and other intellectual property rights amounted to  and  in and  respectively 
these costs relate to legal fees for counsel and consulting fees and expenses incurred associated with the enforcement of our patent and other intellectual property rights that began to increase during the second quarter of and increased substantially during due to the court proceedings in the united kingdom 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by  during primarily due to reductions in staffing and reduction in the use of outside contractors for projects 
research and development expenses to develop our new product lines increased during by  with the availability of equity financing funds 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses decreased by  in as a result of a restructuring of our internal sales and marketing organization  utilization of value added resellers and reduced headcount 
selling and marketing expenses increased by  in with the rebuilding of the sales and marketing organization and expenses associated with the introduction of existing cyberstorage systems products and our new product lines 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by  in of this amount  approximately  represents increases in the allowance for uncollectible accounts domestically and by our foreign subsidiaries 
several of our accounts receivable balances were deemed uncollectible during due to the financial condition of these customer s accounts 
the remaining decrease in general and administrative expenses  exclusive of the additional reserves described above  resulted primarily from cost reduction measures implemented during  including staff reductions and reduced overhead costs 
general and administrative expenses increased by  in due primarily to continued increases in support personnel  travel expenses  legal and auditing services 
amortization of intangibles amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets relate to the acquisition of cyberstorage systems in september during  amortization expense amounted to  amortization of goodwill was eliminated in with the adoption of sfab described on page of this annual report 
amortization of other intangible assets for amounted to  the estimated aggregate amortization expense for other intangible assets is   and  for  and  respectively 
other income expense  net interest income expense  net decreased by  in due primarily to a reduction in cash balances and related interest earned 
interest income expense  net increased by  in due primarily to greater invested cash and cash equivalent balances 
other income expense  net increased by  in due primarily to a gain on settlement of unsecured debt owed to a lender and translation adjustments in reporting for our foreign subsidiaries 
other income expense  net decreased by  during due to translation adjustments in reporting for our foreign subsidiaries 
provision benefit for income taxes the tax benefit in of  resulted from the receipt of a refund claim after an audit by the internal revenue service and related adjustment of net operating losses and business tax credits in prior years 
inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
factors that may affect future results our stock price is volatile our stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility because of factors such as the announcement of new products  services or technological innovations by us or our competitors quarterly variations in our operating results decreasing product and services revenues speculation in the press or investment community failure to meet earning expectations the results of intellectual property litigation 
table of contents in addition  our stock price may be affected by general market conditions  short selling activities  and domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
further  until recently  our stock was thinly traded 
because of these factors  any recent trends should not be considered reliable indicators of future stock prices or financial results 
our business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property we generally rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights in the united states and in other countries to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products 
however  we cannot assure you that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
see  for example  the recent ruling in the united kingdom with respect to our claims against hitachi data systems limited described under item legal proceedings 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
further  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that it may require to conduct our business or that  if obtainable  such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost 
intellectual property rights we are aggressively pursuing the enforcement of our intellectual property rights after an extensive patent review conducted in in  we retained a major law firm to enforce these rights against infringing parties  the number of which management believes to be extensive 
in  we began bringing legal actions against companies whose products we believed infringed on our intellectual property rights and patent portfolio 
please refer to item legal proceedings for current information concerning intellectual property litigation 
we intend to vigorously pursue these actions 
despite the company s and our legal representatives efforts  there can be no assurance or predictability as to any amount of recovery or the length of time it will take us to recover any royalties or license fees which may be recoverable 
in addition  the expense of pursuing these rights is substantial 
as a result  any failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and to prevail in any pending legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on us 
despite our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights  unauthorized use may still occur  particularly in foreign countries 
liquidity and working capital our future success depends on maintaining adequate liquidity and working capital to meet our operational requirements 
on may   we completed a million financing through a private placement of common stock to a group of four european and us based institutional investors 
in that financing  we sold  shares of common stock at per share and issued  warrants to purchase common stock at per share that are exercisable over a five year period 
in addition  in october   we received million from a license fee for our intellectual property 
despite this recent success  revenues from products and services have fallen dramatically and there can be no assurances that we will be able to secure additional license fees of this magnitude or at all during the coming twelve months 
furthermore  given the continued volatility of the global securities markets and  in particular  the market for the securities of technology companies  as well as the recent results of our pending legal actions concerning enforcement of our intellectual property rights  we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing 
our failure to maintain adequate liquidity and working capital would have a material adverse effect on the company  our financial condition and our results of operations 
we incurred operating losses through and we continue to incur operating losses at this time 
while the development and introduction of our new products continues  our actual sales revenue has declined significantly over the last year and continues to be at a low level 
in response in  we have reduced our activity level in marketing  sales and administration and implemented cost reduction programs primarily in employee headcount  the use of independent software subcontractors and the level of expenses for development  travel and administration 

table of contents management believes  although there can be no assurances  that our currently available working capital and the cash flow from our operations in will support our operating plan for the next twelve months 
our operating plan and related cash flow projections for have been forecasted by management anticipating a only a base level of revenue from sales of our new products to new and existing customers and product upgrades  replacement parts and maintenance services from our existing customer base 
we have not included any revenues from potential license fee activities 
we have projected our costs and expenses using our current level of operating expenses for our core business activity and only the minimum requirements for the defense of our intellectual property 
if our projected levels of revenues from products and services are not achieved or are delayed in their realization  management has plans that can be implemented to further reduce the operating expense cash flow requirements to allow the company to continue in business 
these include reductions in salary levels similar to those that were achieved during through a compensation deferral  stock based compensation plan or  in the alternative  additional reductions in staffing headcount 
cost reductions of other non employee related costs  primarily expenses for rent and other facilities occupancy expenses  would also be implemented 
in addition  while the dilutive effect might be significant  the company continues to receive inquires from interested investors to provide equity financing using a variety of alternatives 
we continue to explore strategic alliance opportunities to market our new products that would also provide financial support 
although there can be no assurances  management is committed to achieving or exceeding its base operating plan for and intends to implement those cost reductions and improvements in cash flow to achieve this success 
development of new products and solutions we must make continuous investment in research and development to maintain our ongoing effort to continually improve our products and provide innovative solutions to our customers 
the development of software products is a difficult and costly process and subject to many other products requirements and the availability of substantial capital 
our inability to timely deliver new products in the past has had an adverse effect on our operating and financial results 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively develop and timely deliver new products in the future 
competition we compete with many established companies in the computer storage and server industries and certain of these companies have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources  larger distribution capabilities  earlier access to customers and more opportunity to address customers various information technology requirements than we do 
our business may be adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products by our competitors  including hardware  software and services  price reductions of our competitors equipment or services and the implementation of effective marketing strategies by our competitors 
competitive pricing pressures exist in the computer storage and server markets and have had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
there also has been and may continue to be a willingness on the part of certain competitors to reduce prices in order to preserve or gain market share  which we cannot foresee 
we currently believe that pricing pressures are likely to continue 
the relative and varying rates of product price and component cost declines could have an adverse effect on our earnings 
rapid technological changes the computer industry is changing both dramatically and rapidly 
the development of open systems computing  the introduction of the internet  new fiber technologies san and the increasing storage density in disk drive technologies  have caused an increase in new product development and shorter time to bring the new products to market 
while we believe that our virtual storage architecture vsa  storagesuite and cyberborg products are advanced when compared to competitive products  and complement many other products utilized in total customer solutions  we cannot assure that this will continue in the future 
the failure to 
table of contents remain consistently ahead of competitive technologies would have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition 
business alliances many companies are forming business alliances with their competitors to be able to provide totally integrated storage solutions to their customers 
one result of these alliances is to effectively preclude competitive products from being offered to customers 
many of the relationships are exclusive and our failure to develop similar relationships will effectively reduce the number of qualified sales opportunities we will have for our products in the future 
we believe that we address this issue by our return to the reseller channel sales model and having the integrator solution providers value added resellers perform the solution selling required 
we have had difficulty opening these sales channels and any continued problems in doing so will have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition 
operations our products operate near the limits of electronic and physical performance and are designed and manufactured with relatively small tolerances 
if flaws in design  production  assembly or testing were to occur  we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in substantial repair or replacement costs and potential damage to our reputation 
continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities and control of material and manufacturing quality and costs are critical factors in our future growth 
we frequently revise and update manufacturing and test processes to address engineering and component changes to our products and evaluate the reallocation of manufacturing resources among our facilities 
we cannot assure that our efforts to monitor  develop and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment  significant repair or replacement costs and potential damage to our reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  most companies in the high technology arena are under pressure to be able to acquire and retain the services of talented individuals 
we have had a decline in revenue in each of the three previous years and comparable reduction in our work force 
while we believe that we have the required core personnel to effectively manage and grow  we cannot assure that key employees will not leave the company in the future 
the failure to maintain key employees could adversely affect our future operating and financial results 
failure of suppliers to provide quality products we purchase several sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers 
these components and products include disk drives  high density memory components and power supplies 
we have experienced delivery delays from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality and delivery requirements 
if any of our suppliers were to fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products  we could lose time sensitive customer orders and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  we periodically transition our product line to incorporate new technologies 
the importance of transitioning our customers smoothly to new technologies  along with our historically uneven pattern of quarterly sales  intensifies the risk that a supplier who fails to meet our delivery or quality requirements will have an adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
changes in laws  regulations or other conditions that could adversely impair our condition our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if any laws  regulations or standards  both foreign and domestic  relating to us or our products were newly implemented or changed 

table of contents litigation that we may become involved in may adversely affect us in the ordinary course of business  we may become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have the market risk inherent in financial instruments that relates primarily to fluctuations in the prime rate of interest to be charged under the terms of the several promissory notes due from and to certain of our executive officers and directors 
our foreign subsidiaries obligations to us are denominated in us dollars 
there is a potential for a foreign currency gain or loss based upon fluctuations between the us dollar and our subsidiaries functional currencies  currently the british pound and eurodollar 
this exposure is limited to the period between the time of accrual of such liability to us in our subsidiaries functional currency and the time of their payment to us in us dollars 
this exposure is further reduced with the temporary closing of operations of our european facilities late in other than the inter company balances noted above  we do not believe we have material unhedged monetary assets  liabilities or commitments that are denominated in a currency other than the operations functional currencies
