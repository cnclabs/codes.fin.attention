overview we are a leading developer and operator of value priced laser vision correction centers 
our laser vision correction centers provide the facilities  equipment and support services for performing vision correction procedures using state of the art laser technologies to correct nearsightedness  farsightedness and astigmatism 
the company currently utilizes three laser suppliers  bausch lomb  visx and alcon for our excimer lasers in the us substantially all of the revenues from our laser vision correction procedures are derived from our us centers 
our operating costs and expenses consist of medical professional and license fees  including per procedure fees for the ophthalmologists performing laser vision correction and the license fee per procedure paid to visx  bausch lomb and alcon direct costs of services  including center rent and utilities  equipment lease and maintenance costs  surgical supplies  center staff expense  costs related to other revenue  and all other costs associated with providing services in our centers general and administrative  including headquarters staff expense and other overhead costs marketing and advertising costs depreciation and amortization of equipment and intangible assets recorded in the balance sheet sources of revenues the company derived substantially all of its revenue for the last three years from the delivery of laser vision correction services 
laser refractive surgery laser refractive surgery revenue generally includes three components facility fees  license fees and medical professional fees 
certain states prohibit us from practicing medicine  employing physicians to practice medicine on our behalf or employing optometrists to render optometry services on our behalf 
revenues and direct costs from centers in these states do not include the medical professionals fee component 
the contribution from laser refractive surgery procedures for each of the three years ended december  is as follows dollars in thousands revenue direct costs  medical professional and license fees contribution margin our results of operations in any period are significantly affected by the number of laser vision procedures performed 
the following table details the number of laser vision correction procedures performed at our consolidated centers 
first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year the average price per procedure has increased from in the fourth quarter of to  in the fourth quarter of average price per procedure increased again in the fourth quarter of to  operating costs and expenses compared to the following table shows the dollar amount of increase decrease of operating expenses from to and the percent of revenues for each year dollars in thousands increase of revenue decrease medical professional and license fees direct costs of services general and administrative expenses marketing and advertising depreciation and amortization license fees decreased by  in from the amount spent in the decrease in license fees is due to lower procedure volume in versus enhancement expenses increased  as a result of a slightly higher enhancement rate 
direct costs of services decreased  in versus  because of cost reduction plans implemented in  lower procedure volume in  and decreased rent associated with equipment purchased off from operating leases at the end of exclusive of medical supplies  the average direct cost per month decreased to  in from  in in the fourth quarter  the average direct cost per month exclusive of medical supplies was  general and administrative expenses decreased by  in from the amount expended in salaries benefits and travel entertainment decreased  and  respectively  as a result of cost reduction efforts started in the prior year 
warrant amortization was completed in  resulting in a decrease of  office equipment costs were cut by  in state and local taxes were reduced by  in offsetting these decreases were increases in insurance cost of  and shareholder communications of  in the fourth quarter  general and administrative expenses decreased by  compared to the third quarter the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of  is primarily the result of the purchase of lasers and other equipment that had been leased in the past 
during the third quarter of  management implemented a restructuring plan to close unprofitable locations and to reduce operating expenses 
the cost of the plan was  by the end of the first quarter  the restructuring plan had been fully implemented and had a remaining balance of  which was reversed in the first quarter of other investment income decreased  in from  as a result of lower interest rates and lower average invested cash 
in august  a settlement of  was received from pillar point partner s class action litigation 
pillar point partners a joint entity formed in by laser manufacturers visx and summit technology inc  now a subsidiary of alcon corporation collected per use royalties from all laser vision correction providers using their equipment 
the manufacturers agreed to settle the various lawsuits for million 
pillar point was dissolved in july after the federal trade commission filed an administrative complaint challenging the partnerships existence 
compared to the following table shows the dollar amount of increase decrease of operating expenses from to and the percent of revenues for each year dollars in thousands increase of revenue decrease medical professional and license fees direct costs of services general and administrative expenses marketing and advertising depreciation and amortization license fees decreased in from the amount spent in the increase in license fees due to higher procedure volumes in was more than offset by lower expenditures on enhancements and the full year effect of the reduction in the procedure license fee from to  which occurred in february in addition  physician contracts were renegotiated during the second quarter of to enable the company to be competitive at lower pricing levels for laser vision correction 
direct costs of services include payroll  equipment lease and maintenance  facility rent and supply costs associated with providing our services 
approximately  of the increase in direct costs of services related to more centers being in operation in than were in operation in an increase of  in consumable supplies was the result of higher procedure volumes 
the remaining increase in direct costs of services of  resulted from increase in the average cost to run a center  which increased from  per center per month in to  per center per month in general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately  in from the amount expended in warrant amortization and the repurchase of warrants from cole national corporation decreased warrant related expenses by  in from corporate employment and travel expenses decreased by  legal  accounting and consulting fees were reduced by  in office equipment expenses were cut by  in offsetting a portion of these cost reductions was an increase in insurance costs of  an increase in national call center costs of  and an increase in information systems costs of  marketing and advertising costs decreased by  due to improved advertising effectiveness during the first half of the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of  is a result of year capital expenditures associated with new center openings  and the placement of bausch lomb surgical lasers in each of our markets 
during the third quarter of  management implemented a restructuring plan to close unprofitable locations and to reduce operating expenses 
the cost of the plan is  which is comprised of a  restructuring charge and an  asset impairment charge for leasehold improvements  equipment and goodwill associated with the locations to be closed 
the restructuring charges included  in lease termination costs and  in severance payments for employees 
as of december   the balance of the restructuring renewal was  which relates to future facility rent payments 
also during the third quarter of  the company provided a reserve of  on a loan made to rei corporation which operated a licensed facility in tokyo  japan 
during the quarter  management determined that the loan may not be recoverable 
as a result of the company s operating loss during the third quarter of  and continuing uncertainties regarding the general economic conditions in the united states and the impact on ongoing operations  the company recorded a  valuation reserve for deferred tax assets as of september  this reserve was established according to the requirements of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
at the time the special charges were made  the company anticipated annual cost savings of  based upon cost reductions made prior to year end  management expects to exceed the projected cost savings of the restructuring plan 
other non operating income decreased in over primarily as a result of the termination of a deferred compensation arrangement with a physician in the second quarter of other equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates increased in as a result of growth in the company s managed care business 
interest expense decreased  due to our reduction of capital lease obligations 
interest income decreased  as a result of lower rates and lower average invested balances 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalent and short term investments total  at december   as compared to  at december  net cash provided by operating activities was  major uses of cash were  used under the common stock repurchase program and capital expenditures of  our line of credit with provident bank is  at december   all of the line is available to us for borrowing 
we also have a  line of credit for the purpose of funding acquisitions which is subject to the full and absolute discretion of provident bank 
during the second quarter of  the directors initiated a program to encourage additional direct stock ownership by senior management of the company 
the company offered loans to nine key managers and directors for the purpose of purchasing shares in the open market 
each loan is a personal obligation of the borrower  and is evidenced by a promissory note 
the interest rate on the notes is prime less one and one half percent 
the notes have a maximum term of three years  and contain provisions for early repayment 
as of december   a total of  has been loaned under this program 
at december  and we have federal net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of  and  respectively 
these expire in varying amounts from until approximately  of federal net operating loss carryforwards and  state net operating loss carryforwards were acquired when we bought refractive centers international  inc our ability to use these acquired net operating loss carryforwards is limited to approximately  per year under code section of the internal revenue code 
in december  the company purchased medical equipment that was being leased for  this will result in a reduction in leased equipment expense of  with an increase in depreciation expense of  in as compared to in january  the company opened a new center in cleveland  ohio 
during the remainder of  the company plans to expand into four to six new markets 
the estimated capital expenditures for this expansion will be approximately  the ability to fund our marketing and advertising program  planned capital expenditures and new center rollouts depends on our future performance  which to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based upon our current level of operations and anticipated revenue growth  we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash and short term investments  and available borrowing under the credit facility from provident bank will be adequate to meet these needs 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock our stock price is likely to be highly volatile 
the price at which our common stock will trade has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to a number of factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuation in our results of operations changes in or our failure to meet securities analysts expectations technological innovations increased competition conditions and trends in the laser refractive surgery industry general market conditions of the us economy geopolitical risks that destabilize the world economy in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the securities of healthcare companies  particularly laser vision correction companies 
these broad market fluctuations may result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
laser vision correction does not sustain broad market acceptance which would limit our profitability and growth 
we believe that our profitability and expansion depends largely on the continued acceptance of laser vision correction as a safe  effective treatment 
there can be no assurance that laser vision correction will continue to be widely accepted by ophthalmologists  optometrists or the general population as an alternative to existing methods of treating refractive vision disorders 
continued acceptance of laser vision correction may be affected adversely by concerns relating to its safety and effectiveness general resistance to surgery of any type the effectiveness of alternate methods of correcting refractive vision disorders the lack of long term follow up data and the possibility involving patient outcomes from laser vision correction regulatory developments our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations 
our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  not all of which are in our control 
future revenue is difficult to forecast and for the foreseeable future will be influenced by the timing and number of procedures performed 
many of our expenses  particularly personnel costs and rents  are relatively fixed  and are incurred in part based on expectations of future revenue 
we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in operating income results in any quarter 
because of these factors  quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations may not be an indication of our future performance 
it is possible that  in future periods  our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
this could cause the trading of our common stock to decline 
we depend on limited sources of excimer lasers  microkeratomes and disposable blades  and shortages of these items could hinder our ability to increase our procedure volume 
we currently use three of these laser suppliers  bausch lomb  visx and alcon for our excimer lasers in the us if one or all three of these companies became unwilling or unable to supply us with excimer lasers  to repair or replace parts or to provide services  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we are primarily dependent on bausch lomb to provide the microkeratome  blades and other disposable items we provide to ophthalmologists for the most popular type of laser vision correction 
there are a limited number of manufacturers of microkeratomes and there can be no assurance that microkeratomes and microkeratome blades will be available in the quantities or within the time frames we require 
any shortages in our supplies of this equipment could limit our ability to increase our volume of the lasik procedure 
our business may be impaired due to government regulations which could restrict our equipment  services and relationships with ophthalmologists  optometrists  and other healthcare providers 
we and excimer laser manufacturers are subject to extensive federal  state and foreign laws  rules and regulations  including restrictions on the approval  distribution and use of medical devices anti kickback statutes fee splitting laws corporate practice of medicine restrictions self referral laws anti fraud provisions facility license requirements and certificates of need conflict of interest regulations sales and use taxes many of these laws and regulations are ambiguous  and courts and regulatory authorities have provided little clarification 
moreover  state and local laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
as a result  we may not always be able to accurately interpret applicable law  and some of our activities could be challenged 
the excimer lasers we use in our centers are medical devices that in the united states are subject to the jurisdiction of the fda 
in addition to fda approval for the initial uses of these excimer lasers  new uses require separate approval 
obtaining such approval can be an expensive and time consuming process  the success of which cannot be guaranteed 
the failure of our suppliers to obtain regulatory approvals for any additional uses of excimer lasers or otherwise comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
failure to comply with applicable fda requirements could subject us  ophthalmologists who use our centers or excimer laser manufacturers to enforcement actions  including product seizure  recalls  withdrawal of approvals and civil and criminal penalties 
any such enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  failure to comply with regulatory requirements  or any adverse regulatory action could result in limitations or prohibitions on our use of excimer lasers 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could be sued for patient injuries  and such claims could negatively affect our business 
a partially or completely uninsured claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the laser vision correction procedures performed in our centers involve a potential risk of physical injury to patients 
such risk could result in product liability  malpractice or other claims brought against us based upon injuries or alleged injuries associated with a defect in a product s performance or malpractice by an ophthalmologist or technician 
some injuries or defects may not become evident for a number of years 
therefore  the operation of any excimer laser  microkeratome or other equipment may result in substantial claims against us by patients who allege they were injured as a result of vision correction procedures 
although we have umbrella product and professional liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate  we primarily rely and intend to continue to rely on ophthalmologists professional liability insurance policies and manufacturers insurance policies for product liability coverage 
we require the ophthalmologists who use our centers to maintain certain levels of professional liability insurance 
the availability and the cost of professional liability insurance has increased significantly for many different reasons  many of which are outside the control of the company 
a future increase in cost or lack of availability of coverage for the company or the doctors could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in december  the company formed a captive insurance company to insure professional liability exposure 
if actual claims materially exceed the actuarially projected claims  the company could experience a material adverse event 
critical accounting policies in january  the sec issued fr recommending that companies expand their disclosures related to critical accounting policies 
significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of the financial statements  and critical account policies are discussed in the following paragraph 
income taxes as a result of the company s operating loss during the third quarter of and throughout  and continuing uncertainties regarding the general economic conditions in the united states and the impact on ongoing operations  the company continues to record a full valuation reserve for deferred tax assets 
this reserve was established according to the requirements of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
favorable changes in the company s operating profitability as a result of improved general economic conditions in the united states or otherwise  could impact the company s determination as to whether reduction  in whole or in part  to the valuation reserve is necessary in the future 
the valuation reserve was  at december  cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements information contained above in this management s discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this annual report on form k with respect to expected financial results and future events and trends is forward looking  based on our estimates and assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties 
for those statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the carrying values of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
we have a very low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and as such  have not used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk
