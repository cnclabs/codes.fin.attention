overview of performance the company and its bank subsidiaries derive substantially all of their revenue and income from furnishing bank and bank related services  principally to individuals and small and medium sized companies in new hampshire 
the banks operate as typical community banking institutions and do not engage in any specialized finance or capital market activities 
northway functions primarily as the holder of stock of its subsidiaries and assists the management of its subsidiaries as appropriate 
the company reported net income of  or per common share  in compared to net income of  or per common share  in and  or per common share  in return on average equity was percent in  compared to percent in and percent for return on average assets was percent in  compared to percent and percent for and  respectively 
during the year  the company continued the implementation of its growth initiatives with the purchase of three branches located in laconia  belmont and pittsfield  new hampshire 
also during the company installed technology totaling approximately  including a wide area network  a voice over internet protocol telephone system  a new on line teller system  document imaging and computer upgrades 
the company also made increases to staff during the year  most notably in the lending area 
in addition  the sustained weakness of the equity market and the impact it had on certain holdings of the company s equity securities resulted in net losses on sale of equity securities of  and write downs of equities of  costs associated with the expansion of our branch network  new technology and personnel resulted in increased noninterest expense which  when added to the loss on sale of equity securities and the write down of equity securities  caused a decline in earnings as compared to during  the company purchased a branch location in littleton  new hampshire  completed construction of a new branch location in tilton  new hampshire and moved its existing tilton branch into this location 
during  the company purchased a branch in west ossipee  new hampshire 
these investments resulted in increased noninterest expense which  when added to the decline in net interest income associated with the rapidly declining interest rate environment  caused a decline in earnings as compared to net interest and dividend income analysis net interest and dividend income is the principal component of a financial institution s income stream and represents the difference  or spread  between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as changes in volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest and dividend income 
the discussion of net interest and dividend income is presented on a taxable equivalent basis  unless otherwise noted  to facilitate performance comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt assets 
the table on page  entitled consolidated average balances  interest and dividend income expense and average yields rates  presents average balances  income earned or interest paid  and average yields earned or rates paid on major categories of assets and liabilities for the years ended december    and net interest and dividend income for increased  or percent  over while decreasing  or percent  in over interest and dividend income decreased  or percent  in compared to the continued decline in market interest rates caused a percent decrease in the yield on average earning assets 
a percent decrease in the yield on loans was partially offset by an increase in average loan balances of  this resulted in a net decrease of  or percent  in interest and fees on loans 
federal funds sold income decreased  as a decrease in average yield of percent was partially offset by a  increase in the average balance 
this was partially offset by an increase in interest and dividend income on securities of  which was the result of an increase in average balances of  partially offset by a decrease in average yield of percent 
interest expense decreased  or percent  in compared to the decrease in net interest expense was due primarily to a percent decrease in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities partially offset by an increase in average balances of  the increase in average balances is the result of the addition of guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in junior subordinated debentures issued by the company s delaware statutory business trusts  northway capital trust i and northway capital trust ii  with an average balance of  as well as an increase in average interest bearing deposit balances of  associated primarily with the branches acquired in the fourth quarter of interest and dividend income decreased  or percent  in compared to a rapidly declining rate environment caused a percent decrease in the yield on average earning assets 
a percent decrease in the yield on loans that was partially offset by an increase in average loan balances of  resulted in a  or percent  decrease in interest and fees on loans 
interest and dividend income on securities decreased  or percent 
this decrease resulted from a percent decrease in the average balance of securities as well as a percent decline in the yield 
interest expense decreased  or percent  in compared to the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to a percent decrease in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of  or percent 
a decrease of  or percent  in the average balance of federal home loan bank fhlb advances  coupled with a decrease in the rate on such advances of percent  resulted in a decrease in interest expense on fhlb advances of  in addition  rates paid on deposit liabilities declined percent resulting in a decrease in interest expense of  these changes were partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing deposits of  or percent  which increased interest expense by  the trend in net interest and dividend income is commonly evaluated in terms of average rates using net interest margin and interest rate spread 
the net interest margin is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent net interest and dividend income by average total earning assets 
this ratio represents the difference between the average yield returned on average earning assets and the average rate paid for all funds used to support those earning assets  including both interest bearing and noninterest bearing sources of funds 
the net interest margin decreased percent to percent in after having decreased percent to percent in the decrease in s net interest margin was a direct result of the decrease in the yield on earning assets  which was only partially offset by the decrease in the cost of funds 
the portion of interest earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities rose to percent in compared to percent in both and the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the impact of noninterest bearing funds and gives a direct perspective on the effect of interest rate movements 
during  the net interest rate spread increased percent to percent as the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased percent while the yield on earning assets declined percent 
during  the net interest rate spread decreased percent to percent as the yield on earning assets declined percent while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased percent

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents the annual cost of providing an allowance for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the size of the provision for each year is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  the value of collateral and general economic factors 
the company made a  provision for loan losses in  which provision was unchanged from the provision of  was  lower than s provision of  the provision for each of the three years was based upon the company s judgment regarding the adequacy of the coverage ratio and level of portfolio risk 
although management utilizes its best judgment in providing for losses  there can be no assurance that the company will not have to change its provisions for loan losses in subsequent periods 
management will continue to monitor the allowance for loan losses and make additional provisions to the allowance as appropriate

securities designated to be held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
securities classified as available for sale are required to be reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  excluded from earnings and shown separately as a component of stockholders equity

 to transfer all securities held to maturity to the available for sale category at their market value 
the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale was  at december  compared to a net unrealized loss on securities available for sale of  at december  at december   the net unrealized gain on debt securities totaled  which was partially offset by a net unrealized loss on marketable equity securities of  the net unrealized gain on debt securities is primarily the result of the low rate environment during  which resulted in an appreciation in value of existing debt holdings 
the net unrealized loss on marketable equity securities is primarily the result of the weak equity market during due to the sustained overall weakness in the equity market as well as significant declines in certain sectors and specific companies within those sectors  the company determined  through the evaluations described in note to the consolidated financial statements  that the market values of certain of its marketable equity securities were other than temporarily impaired 
as a result  during net losses on sales of marketable equity securities amounted to  and write downs of marketable equity securities amounted to  at december   the company s investment in equity securities totaled  this amount is net of a market value adjustment of  of which the full amount was reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity

however  a corporate bond with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  was downgraded by both moody s and standard poor s during this bond is being carried at fair value and continues to perform in accordance with its original terms 
all securities  however  carry interest rate risk  which affect their market values such that as market yields increase  the value of the company s securities decline and vice versa 
additionally  mortgage backed securities carry prepayment risk whereby expected yields may not be achieved due to the inability to reinvest proceeds from prepayment at comparable yields 
moreover  such mortgage backed securities may not benefit from price appreciation in periods of declining rates to the same extent as the remainder of the portfolio 
a portion of the securities portfolio is pledged to secure public deposits  short term securities sold under agreements to repurchase and treasury  tax and loan accounts

residential real estate loans increased by  in  a percent increase from  compared to a decrease of  or percent  in as compared to the company originates both fixed rate and adjustable rate residential loans for its portfolio 
some fixed rate residential loans are originated for sale to investors in the secondary market 
the increase in residential real estate loans in resulted primarily from the company s decision to retain a greater percentage of fixed rate residential mortgage loans 
installment loans consist primarily of loans originated directly by the company  however  as part of the laconia  belmont and pittsfield branch acquisitions the company purchased installment loans totaling approximately  as a result of these acquired loans  installment loans balances increased a net of  compared to indirect installment loans increased by  or percent  in nonperforming assets nonperforming assets were  or percent of total assets  at december  compared to  or percent of total assets  at december   an increase of  or percent 
this increase was due primarily to the addition to nonperforming status of a large commercial credit totaling  in addition  nonaccrual mortgage loans increased over the prior year 
nonperforming assets are comprised primarily of nonaccrual loans  other chattels owned and real estate acquired by foreclosure or a similar conveyance of title 
the accrual of interest on a loan is discontinued when there is reasonable doubt as to its collectibility or whenever the payment of principal or interest is more than days past due 
however  there are loans within this nonaccrual classification that provide periodic payments  but which have a weakness with respect to the collateral securing the loan 
at december   nonaccrual loans totaled  or percent of total loans  compared to  or percent of total loans  in other real estate owned at december  was  compared to  at december  allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
when a loan  or portion thereof  is considered uncollectible  it is charged against the allowance 
recoveries of amounts previously charged off are added to the allowance when collected 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management 
factors considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance include previous loss experience  current economic conditions and their effect on borrowers and the market area in general  and the performance of individual credits in relation to the contract terms 
the provision for loan losses charged to earnings is based on management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb losses 
in addition various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses 
the company s allowance for loan losses increased  from december  to  or percent of total loans  at december  the provision for loan losses was  unchanged from the prior year

the following table sets forth certain information concerning the company s borrowings at the dates indicated omitted december  short term borrowings   long term debt   guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in junior subordinated debentures during april and july the company completed the private placement of  and  respectively  of floating rate trust preferred securities due in these trust preferred securities were offered for the purpose of providing capital to the subsidiary banks to ensure adequate capital following the recent branch acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 
as of december    qualified as tier capital and  was allocated to tier capital 
capital the company s stockholders equity serves to support growth and provide depositors and other creditors protection against loss 
equity capital represents the stockholders investment in the company 
management strives to maintain an optimal level of capital on which an attractive return to the stockholders will be realized over both the short term and long term  while serving depositors and creditors needs 
the company must also observe the minimum requirements enforced by the federal banking regulators 
there are three capital requirements that banks and bank holding companies must meet tier capital  total capital combination of tier capital and tier capital  and leverage tier capital to average assets ratios 
tier capital consists of stockholders equity  net of intangible assets as well as a portion of capital securities 
tier capital consists of a limited amount of allowance for loan losses and the portion of capital securities not allocated to tier capital 
tier capital  total capital and leverage ratios do not include any adjustments for unrealized gains and losses relating to securities available for sale except net unrealized losses relating to marketable equity securities 
the minimum requirements for the leverage ratio  risk based tier capital and risk based total capital are percent  percent and percent  respectively 
as of december   the subsidiary banks of the company were well capitalized as defined under fdic regulations 
the following table sets forth the company s risk based capital and leverage ratios omitted december  risk adjusted assets   tier capital to average assets tier capital to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets total stockholders equity includes a  and  negative adjustment for accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax  at december  and  respectively 
at december   this adjustment was comprised of a net unrealized loss on securities available for sale of  net of taxes  and an unfunded pension accumulated benefit obligation of  net of taxes 
the net unrealized loss on securities available for sale is attributable to the downturn in the securities market 
while the company continues to contribute the maximum amount permitted by law to its pension plan  the discount rate used to calculate the future value of such contribution and the poor asset performance of investment securities has resulted in the unfunded pension accumulated benefit obligation 
the company intends to continue to pay dividends on a quarterly basis subject to the financial condition and earnings of the company  capital requirements  and other factors  including applicable governmental regulations 
no dividends will be payable unless declared by the board of directors and then only to the extent funds are legally available for the payment of such dividends 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by the company s boards of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to company s management asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and interest expenses associated with the company s financial instruments also change  thereby impacting net interest income nii  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet 
the company uses computer simulations to determine the impact on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics such as loan and deposit growth  loan and deposit pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations based on numerous assumptions are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net interest income and capital 
from these scenarios  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a year horizon given both an immediate basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates 
using an immediate rate shock simulation where interest rates increase basis points  the december  earnings simulation model projects that net interest income for the next twelve months would increase by an amount equal to approximately percent 
in addition  utilizing an immediate rate shock simulation where interest rates decrease basis points  the december  earnings simulation model projects that net interest income for the next twelve months would decrease by an amount equal to approximately percent 
using an immediate rate shock simulation where interest rates increase basis points  the december  earnings simulation model projected that net interest income for the following twelve months would increase by an amount equal to approximately percent 
in addition  utilizing an immediate rate shock simulation where interest rates decrease basis points  the december  earnings simulation model projected that net interest income for the following twelve months would decrease by an amount equal to approximately percent 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including  among others  the nature and timing of interest rate levels  yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cashflows the assumptions differed in each of the periods included in the sensitivity analysis above 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
the most significant factors affecting the changes in market risk exposure during compared to were the decrease in interest rates market wide  changes in the yield curve for investment securities  the increase in the aggregate principal amount in fixed rate loans extended by the subsidiary banks  the aggregate increase in securities available for sale  and increase in total deposits  as well as the increase in floating rate subordinated debentures 
liquidity risk liquidity risk management involves the company s and its subsidiaries ability to raise funds in order to meet their existing and anticipated financial obligations 
these obligations are the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at contractual maturity  the repayment of debt as it matures  the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities 
liquidity may be provided through amortization  maturity or sale of assets such as loans and securities available for sale  liability sources such as increased deposits  utilization of the fhlb credit facility  purchased or other borrowed funds  and access to the capital markets 
liquidity targets are subject to change based on economic and market conditions and are controlled and monitored by the company s asset liability committee 
at the bank level  liquidity is managed by measuring the net amount of marketable assets after deducting pledged assets  plus lines of credit  primarily with the fhlb  which are available to fund liquidity requirements 
management then measures the adequacy of that aggregate amount relative to the aggregate amount of liabilities deemed to be sensitive or volatile 
these include brokered deposits  deposits in excess of  term deposits with short maturities  and credit commitments outstanding 
additionally  the parent holding company requires cash for various operating needs including dividends to shareholders  the purchase of treasury stock  capital injections to the subsidiary banks  and the payment of general corporate expenses 
the primary sources of liquidity for the parent holding company are dividends from the subsidiary banks and reimbursement for services performed on behalf of the banks 
additionally  the parent holding company may utilize outside sources of funding such as the trust preferred issues undertaken during as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows  cash and cash equivalents decreased by  during cash used for investing activities totaled  with lending activities utilizing  and investment purchases utilizing  cash provided by financing activities totaled  this cash consisted of  from a branch acquisition   from the issuance of guaranteed preferred beneficial interest in junior subordinated debentures  as well as an increase in other deposits of  the net cash provided by operating activities totaled  and consisted primarily of net income of  as well as a decrease in loans held for sale partially offset by an increase in other assets and other liabilities  net
