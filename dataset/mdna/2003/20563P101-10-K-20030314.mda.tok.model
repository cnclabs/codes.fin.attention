item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company reported net income of 
million  or 
per diluted share for the year ended december   a decrease of compared to net income of million or 
per diluted share for the year ended december  the company s net income in was million  or per diluted share 
the continued weak economic conditions in the manufacturing sector in north america and europe  coupled with the substantial rise in steel prices  had a significant impact on compx s results in several cost control initiatives were commenced during the year in response to the continuing soft market demand in order to minimize the adverse effects of lower sales and favorably position compx to meet demand when the economy recovers 
these initiatives were in addition to actions taken during that included a restructuring of its european operations in the fourth quarter of the most significant action was the retooling of its byron center  michigan precision slide facility in the fourth quarter of to rationalize several products within its precision slide product family 
the byron center retooling is expected to achieve operating efficiencies that should begin to positively impact operating results in the first quarter of during  compx anticipates continuing its focus on opportunities to rationalize its cost structure 
as part of this initiative  compx plans to consolidate its two kitchener  ontario plants into a single facility and expects substantial completion of this action during the second quarter of expenses relating to this consolidation are expected to primarily consist of the cost to move machinery and equipment and are not anticipated to include a significant cost for the disposal of fixed assets 
other facility and product rationalization evaluations are also under review 
these other evaluations could result in additional charges for asset impairment  including goodwill  and other costs in future quarters 
the company defines its operations in terms of three operating segments compx security products  compx waterloo and compx regout formerly called compx europe 
the compx security products segment  with manufacturing facilities in south carolina and illinois  manufactures locking mechanisms and other security products for sale to the office furniture  banking  vending  computer and other industries 
the compx waterloo segment  with facilities in canada  michigan and taiwan  and the compx regout segment  with facilities in the netherlands  both manufacture a complete line of precision ball bearing slides for use in office furniture  computer related equipment  tool storage cabinets and other applications 
both of these segments also either manufacture and or distribute ergonomic computer support systems 
because of the similar economic characteristics between the compx waterloo and compx regout segments and due to the identical products  customer types  production processes and distribution methods shared by these two segments  they have been aggregated into a single reportable segment for segment reporting purposes 
prior period segment information has been reclassified to reflect the current operating segments 
as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  beginning in the company no longer recognizes periodic amortization of goodwill in its results of operations 
the company would have reported net income of approximately million in  or about million higher million  or about million higher in than what was actually reported  if the goodwill amortization included in the company s reported net income had not been recognized 
of such million difference  approximately million and 
million relate to the company s compx security products and compx waterloo compx regout segments  respectively approximately million and million  respectively in 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  the recoverability of other long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets and the realization of deferred income tax assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical financial statement judgment risks of its business are attributable to four primary areas o will customer accounts receivable on the books be collected at full book value o will inventory on hand be sold with a sufficient mark up to cover the cost to produce and ship the product o will future cash flows of the company be sufficient to recover the net book value of long lived assets o will future taxable income be sufficient to utilize recorded deferred income tax assets the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates  as noted above  used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and are applicable to all of the company s operating segments o allowance for uncollectable accounts receivable 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company takes into consideration the current financial condition of the customers  the age of outstanding balances and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowances 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  increased allowances may be required 
o inventory reserves 
the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
the company also considers the age and the quantity of inventory on hand in estimating the reserve 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  increased inventory reserves may be required 
o net book value of long lived assets 
the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  whenever it determines that recovery of the long lived asset is not probable 
the determination is made in accordance with applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
based on the company s latest annual impairment review of goodwill of the reporting units during the third quarter of  no goodwill impairments were deemed to exist 
based on this review  the estimated fair value of the compx waterloo compx regout and compx security products reporting units exceeded the net carrying values by and  respectively 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
o deferred income tax assets 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realizable under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized 
this would result in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in estimate is made 
results of operations net sales and operating income years ended december  change in millions net sales compx waterloo compx regout segment compx security products segment total net sales operating income loss compx waterloo compx regout segment compx security products segment total operating income operating income loss margin compx waterloo compx regout segment compx security products segment total operating income margin year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales decreased million  or  in compared to principally due to continued weak demand for the company s component products sold to the office furniture market resulting from continued weak economic conditions in the manufacturing sector in north america and europe 
net sales of slide products in decreased as compared to  while net sales of security products decreased and net sales of ergonomic products decreased during the same period 
the company s cost of goods sold decreased only in compared to despite the decrease in net sales during the same period 
therefore  the company s gross margin percentage decreased significantly from in to in the disproportionate change in cost of goods sold and its effect on gross margins was primarily due to lower revenues from sales of slide and ergonomic products and the resulting impact of spreading fixed factory costs over lower volume 
in addition  steel cost increases following the steel tariff imposed by the united states government increased the company s raw material cost  most of which was not immediately recoverable through sales price increases in such steel cost increases resulted in additional raw material costs to compx of approximately million compared to steel raw material pricing 
the compx waterloo compx regout segment was most significantly impacted by the steel cost increases  while the effects on the compx security products segment were minimal 
operating income for decreased million  or compared to and operating margins decreased to in compared to for continued reductions in manufacturing  fixed overhead and other overhead costs partially offset the effects of the decline in net sales in however  operating margins in continued to be adversely impacted by the decline in volume levels  unfavorable changes in the sales mix  increases in certain raw material costs primarily steel and general competitive pricing pressures 
through december   goodwill was amortized by the straight line method over not more than years 
upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january   goodwill is no longer subject to periodic amortization 
the company would have reported operating income of approximately million in if the goodwill amortization included in the company s reported operating income had not been recognized 
without goodwill amortization  operating income for the compx waterloo compx regout segment would have been approximately million in and operating income for the compx security products segment would have been approximately million 
the company recorded a pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of of million  the majority of which was non cash in nature 
the fourth quarter charge relates to a retooling of the company s precision slide manufacturing facility in byron center  michigan and includes a million loss on disposal of equipment  reflected in other general corporate income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 
the remainder of the charge is reflected in cost of goods sold 
the cost savings and operating efficiencies resulting from the retooling are expected to begin to benefit the financial results in the first quarter of an additional fourth quarter pre tax charge of approximately million was recorded to cost of goods sold to adjust for various changes in estimates with respect to obsolete and slow moving inventory  inventory overhead absorption rates and other items 
approximately million of this charge related to the compx waterloo compx regout segment with the remaining 
million relating to the compx security products segment 
pre tax charges of million were also recorded in the fourth quarter of  and are discussed in connection with sales and operating income for compared to  below 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states principally in canada  the netherlands and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the canadian dollar  the dutch guilder  the euro and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations principally in canada are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar values of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect the compx waterloo compx regout segment  and do not materially affect the compx security products segment 
during  the effects of currency fluctuations did not materially impact the company or the compx waterloo compx regout segment 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales decreased million  or  in compared to due to decreased demand for the company s products resulting from continued weak economic conditions in the manufacturing sector in north america and europe  and to a lesser extent  the negative effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
net sales of slide products in decreased as compared to  while net sales of security products and ergonomic products each decreased during the same period 
cost of goods sold decreased in as compared to due to the lower sales volume in as a percentage of sales  cost of sales increased from in to in due primarily to the spreading of fixed production costs over lower sales volumes 
in addition  a million pre tax charge related to various changes in estimate with respect to reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory was recorded in the fourth quarter of and negatively impacted cost of goods sold 
operating income for decreased million  or compared to and operating income margins decreased to in compared to for reductions in manufacturing  fixed overhead and related overhead costs  which began in the first quarter of  partially offset the effects of the decline in net sales in however  despite these cost reductions  operating margins in were adversely impacted by the decline in volume levels and the related impact on manufacturing efficiencies  the effects of unfavorable changes in the sales mix and general pricing pressures 
operating income at the compx waterloo compx regout segment decreased in compared to  while operating income at the compx security products segment decreased for the same period 
a pre tax million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of and a proportionately larger impact resulting from unfavorable changes in the sales mix contributed to the more substantial operating income decline at the compx waterloo compx regout segment as compared to the compx security products segment 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the fourth quarter restructuring charge included headcount reductions of about employees at compx s maastricht  the netherlands facility  substantially all of which had been implemented by december  of the million charge  as adjusted for changes in currency exchange rates  approximately 
million was paid in  million was paid in and 
million was paid in january in addition  approximately million in pre tax charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of these charges are predominately comprised of million related to various changes in estimates with respect to reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory  approximately 
million related to allowances for doubtful accounts  with the remainder related to other items 
of the million charges  approximately 
million related to the compx waterloo compx regout segment and the remaining million related to the compx security products segment 
in  excluding the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company s sales decreased compared to sales of the compx waterloo compx regout segment decreased  exclusive of the effects of currency and acquisitions 
operating income comparisons for this period  however  were not materially impacted by the effects of currency 
the effects of currency fluctuations do not materially affect the compx security products segment 
general the company s profitability primarily depends on its ability to utilize its production capacity effectively  which is affected by  among other things  the demand for its products and its ability to control its manufacturing costs  primarily comprised of labor costs and raw materials such as zinc  copper  coiled steel and plastic resins 
raw material costs represent approximately of the company s total cost of sales 
during and  steel prices did not change significantly compared to the respective prior years 
however  in  worldwide steel prices increased significantly following the steel tariff imposed by the united states government 
the company occasionally enters into raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the short term impact of future increases in raw material costs 
while these arrangements do not commit the company to a minimum volume of purchases  they generally provide for stated unit prices based upon achievement of specified volume purchase levels 
this allows the company to stabilize raw material purchase prices to a certain extent  provided the specified minimum monthly purchase quantities are met 
the company entered into such arrangements for zinc  coiled steel and plastic resins in and does not anticipate further significant changes in the cost of these materials from their current levels for the next year 
materials purchased on the spot market are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
due to the competitive nature of the markets served by the company s products  it is often difficult to recover such increases in raw material costs through increased product selling prices 
consequently  overall operating margins may be affected by such raw material cost pressures 
at december   none of the company s employees in the us  the netherlands or taiwan were represented by bargaining units  and wage increases for such employees historically have been in line with overall inflation indices 
approximately of the company s canadian employees are covered by a three year collective bargaining agreement which provided for annual wage increases of approximately 
wage increases for these canadian employees historically have also been in line with overall inflation indices 
the collective bargaining agreement expired in january and has been replaced with a new agreement which expires in january the new agreement retains the general provisions of the old agreement and provides for annual wage increases from to over the life of the contract 
in january  the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets of chicago lock company for approximately million  further expanding its security products line 
this acquisition was financed through a combination of cash on hand and increased borrowings under the company s revolving senior credit facility 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries  commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expense was in  in and in despite cost reduction programs implemented in  the decline in sales volumes outpaced the ability of the company to reduce its selling  general and administrative expense during and as a result  the company s selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased since other general corporate income expense  net as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements  other general corporate income expense  net primarily includes interest income  losses on disposal of property and equipment and net foreign currency transaction gain and loss 
in  loss on disposal of property and equipment included approximately million related to the retooling of the company s precision slide manufacturing facility in byron center  michigan 
the remainder of the pre tax charge  
million  is reflected in cost of goods sold and related to the cost of moving and installing machinery and equipment as well as the disposal of obsolete inventory 
interest income decreased in compared to due primarily to lower interest rates earned on funds available for investment combined with a lower level of funds available for investment 
conversely  interest income increased when compared to due to higher levels of available funds for investment 
in  a curtailment gain of approximately 
million was included in other general corporate income  net 
this curtailment gain  more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  relates to the cessation of benefits provided under compx s defined benefit plan which covered substantially all full time employees of thomas regout international bv as of december   certain obligations related to the terminated plan had not yet been fully settled and are reflected in accrued pension costs 
in  such obligations were settled and the company reported a 
million settlement gain 
interest expense interest expense declined million in compared to due primarily to lower average interest rates and lower levels of outstanding indebtedness on compx s revolving senior credit facility 
in contrast  interest expense increased 
million in compared to due to higher average levels of outstanding indebtedness on compx s revolving senior credit facility 
interest expense in is expected to be somewhat higher compared to due to slightly higher interest rates charged on the company s new revolving bank credit agreement  which is explained more fully below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes the principal reasons for the difference between compx s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax rates vary by jurisdiction country and or state  and relative changes in the geographic mix of compx s pre tax earnings can result in fluctuations in the effective income tax rate 
net income in was negatively impacted by an increase in the effective income tax rate primarily as a result of lower income levels and an increased proportion of foreign sourced dividend income taxed at a higher effective tax rate 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective january   the company no longer recognizes periodic amortization of goodwill 
under gaap  generally there is no income tax benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes attributable to goodwill amortization 
accordingly  ceasing to periodically amortize goodwill beginning in resulted in a reduction in the company s overall effective income tax rate in as compared to  partially offsetting the increased effective tax rate on foreign sourced income 
other reflected in the results of operations is a million gain on the sale leaseback of the company s manufacturing facility in the netherlands  which is discussed more fully below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions compx is a party to certain transactions with related parties 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
outlook the company expects that weak market conditions will continue in the office furniture market  the primary end market for the company s products 
as a result  sales volumes are expected to remain depressed through at least and competitive pricing pressures are expected to continue 
the company has initiated price increases on certain of its products and will continue to focus on cost improvement initiatives  utilizing lean manufacturing techniques and prudent balance sheet management in order to minimize the impact of lower sales to the office furniture industry and to develop value added customer relationships with additional focus on sales of the company s higher margin ergonomic computer support systems to improve operating results 
among the company s cost control initiatives is a plan to consolidate its two kitchener  ontario plants into one facility 
expenses related to this consolidation are expected to primarily consist of the cost to move machinery and equipment and are not anticipated to include a significant net cost for the disposal of fixed assets 
substantial completion of the consolidation is expected by the end of the second quarter of in addition  other facility rationalizations are also under review and could result in additional charges for asset impairment  including goodwill  and other costs in future quarters 
these actions  along with other activities to eliminate duplicate product lines and excess capacity  are designed to position the company to more effectively concentrate on both new product and new customer opportunities to improve company profitability 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash flows operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  for  and have generally been similar to the trend in the company s earnings 
net cash provided by operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  in  and totaled million  million and million  respectively  compared to net income of million  million and 
million  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in as compared to in part due to the acquisitions discussed above and additional expenditures on facilities improvements and enhancements discussed below 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in compared to due primarily to the cessation of amortization of goodwill 
see notes and changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such changes in assets and liabilities generally tend to even out over time 
however  year to year relative changes in assets and liabilities can significantly affect the comparability of cash flows from operating activities 
for example  relative changes in assets and liabilities consumed approximately million of cash in however  during and  with compx s specific focus on working capital management  relative changes in assets and liabilities generated a net million and million  respectively  in cash 
therefore  despite the significant decline in earnings in as compared to  cash from operating activities in remained fairly consistent with primarily due to cash generated from inventory and accounts receivable reduction initiatives undertaken during the cash generated from these initiatives during was partially offset by a use of cash related to relative changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting from the overall decline in operating activity from to the inventory and accounts receivable reduction initiatives continued during  resulting in the generation of cash from relative changes in inventory and accounts receivable  although the amount of cash generated from such relative changes was less than the amount generated in however  this positive cash generated was partially offset by the use of million in cash during relating to the restructuring reserve that was recorded in the fourth quarter of investing activities 
net cash used by investing activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used by investing activities includes approximately million in for the chicago lock acquisition 
in  million in cash was provided from the sale leaseback of the company s plant facility in the netherlands 
other cash flows from investing activities in each of the past three years related principally to capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in the past three years emphasized manufacturing equipment which utilizes new technologies and increases automation of the manufacturing process to provide for increased productivity and efficiency 
the capital expenditures in relate primarily to the completion of facility expansions at the company s kitchener facility  additional facility expansions at the company s byron center facility and general equipment upgrades and modernization 
capital expenditures in and relate primarily to general equipment upgrades and modernization 
pursuant to the sale leaseback of the company s plant facility in maastricht  the netherlands  compx sold the manufacturing facility with a net carrying value of million for million cash consideration in december  and compx simultaneously entered into a leaseback of the facility with a nominal monthly rental for approximately months 
compx has the option to extend the leaseback period for up to an additional two years with monthly rentals of  to  compx may terminate the leaseback at any time without penalty 
in addition to the cash received up front  compx included an estimate of the fair market value of the monthly rental during the nominal rental leaseback period as part of the sale proceeds 
a portion of the gain from the sale of the facility after transaction costs  equal to the present value of the monthly rentals over the expected leaseback period including the fair market value of the monthly rental during the nominal rental leaseback period  was deferred and is being amortized into income over the expected leaseback period 
compx is recognizing rental expense over the leaseback period  including amortization of the prepaid rent consisting of the estimated fair market value of the monthly rental during the nominal rental leaseback period 
pursuant to the agreement  compx is also obligated to acquire approximately acres from the municipality of maastricht for approximately million within the next two years 
capital expenditures for are estimated at approximately million  the majority of which relate to projects that emphasize improved production efficiency 
firm purchase commitments for capital projects in process at december  approximated million 
financing activities 
net cash provided used by financing activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
total cash dividends paid in were million and in each of and were million 
per share in each of through 
the company used available cash on hand to reduce its outstanding debt by million in june and borrowed million on its unsecured revolving senior credit facility in the third quarter of the company s board of directors has authorized the company to purchase up to approximately million shares of its common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions at unspecified prices and over an unspecified period of time 
as of december   the company had purchased approximately  shares for an aggregate of million pursuant to such authorization million for  shares in  million for  shares in and nil in 
in january  the company replaced its expiring million unsecured revolving senior credit facility with a new million secured revolving bank credit agreement 
had the facility been in place at december   million would have been available for future borrowing 
the new credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the company s united states assets and at least of the ownership interests in the company s first tier non united states subsidiaries 
provisions contained in the credit agreement could result in the acceleration of the indebtedness prior to its stated maturity for reasons other than defaults from failing to comply with typical financial covenants 
for example  the company s credit agreement allows the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
the terms of the credit agreement could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside of the ordinary course of business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other than certain operating leases discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  neither compx nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates are parties to any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other management believes that cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under the revolving bank credit agreement  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and dividends 
to the extent that the company s actual operating results or other developments differ from the company s expectations  compx s liquidity could be adversely affected 
in this regard  during the company s quarterly common stock dividend of 
per share exceeded the company s earnings per share 
to the extent that the company s future operating results continue to be insufficient to cover such dividend  it is possible the company might decide to reduce or suspend its quarterly dividend 
the company periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  its capital expenditure requirements  dividend policy and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of its common stock  modify its dividend policy or take a combination of such steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  the company may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations in the component products industry 
in the event of any such transaction  the company may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing the indebtedness of the company or its subsidiaries 
contractual obligations 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company is obligated to make future payments under certain debt and lease agreements  and is a party to other commitments 
the following table summarizes these obligations as of december  payments due by period less than total year years years in thousands long term debt   capital lease obligations and other operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations   other long term obligation maastricht real estate acquisition obligation   total contractual cash obligations     in addition  the company is a party to certain other agreements that contractually and unconditionally commit the company to pay certain amounts in the future 
while the company believes it is probable that amounts will be spent in the future under such contracts  the amount and or the timing of such future payments will vary depending on certain provisions of the applicable contract 
agreements to which the company is a party that fall into this category  more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  are compx s patent license agreements under which it pays royalties based on the volume of certain products manufactured in canada and sold in the united states 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company periodically uses currency forward contracts to manage a portion of foreign exchange rate risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency 
otherwise  the company does not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor does the company enter into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
other than the contracts discussed below  the company was not a party to any forward or derivative option contract related to foreign exchange rates or interest rates at december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  substantially all of the company s outstanding indebtedness were variable rate borrowings 
such borrowings at december  related principally to million million at december  in borrowings under the company s unsecured revolving senior credit facility which was replaced by a million secured revolving bank credit agreement in january the outstanding balances at december  and which approximate fair value had a weighted average interest rate of and  respectively 
amounts outstanding under the new credit facility are due in january the remaining indebtedness outstanding at december  and is not material 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products outside the united states principally canada  western europe and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the non us dollar  principally the canadian dollar  the euro and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations principally in canada are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
certain of compx s sales generated by its canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
to manage a portion of the foreign exchange rate market risk associated with receivables  or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  at december  compx had entered into a series of short term forward exchange contracts maturing through january to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars at an exchange rate of cdn 
per us dollar 
at each balance sheet date  outstanding currency forward contracts are marked to market with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently 
the difference between the estimated fair value and the face value of all such outstanding forward contracts at december  is not material 
at december   the actual exchange rate was cdn 
per us dollar 
no foreign exchange contracts were outstanding at december  other 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events or losses 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties some of which are listed in business general
