excluding merger and restructuring charges and goodwill amortization  operating earnings increased million or 
per diluted share in compared to the increase was due to improved margins in our regulated energy resources business  a full year of contributions from our energy gas business that was acquired in may in conjunction with the mcn energy acquisition and increased contribution from our non regulated businesses  primarily synfuels 
partially offsetting these improvements were higher operation and maintenance expenses  and interest expense 
the issuance of million shares of dte energy common stock in conjunction with the may mcn energy acquisition  net of million shares repurchased in  and the issuance of million shares in june  also impacted the earnings per share comparison 
earnings in decreased million  or per diluted share from as previously discussed  the earnings decline was due to significant merger and restructuring charges and goodwill amortization recorded in additionally  merger and restructuring charges were recorded in reducing income by million  or 
per diluted share 
excluding merger and restructuring charges and goodwill amortization  earnings increased million  or 
per diluted share in compared to the improvement in earnings primarily reflects contributions from our energy gas business and from our non regulated businesses 
partially offsetting these improvements were increased interest on long term debt and lower margins from regulated electricity operations 
strategic direction we are committed to increasing our annual earnings at a average rate 
our growth strategy is to strengthen the core electric and gas utilities  add to our portfolio of non regulated businesses and leverage investments in energy technology 
non regulated growth is expected to shift over the next few years from profits from tax advantaged coal based fuels businesses that generate section tax credits to growth from energy technologies  on site energy projects  generation projects  energy trading  coal services  waste coal recovery and coal bed methane

electricity is generated from detroit edison s numerous fossil plants  its hydroelectric pumped storage plant and its nuclear plant and sold principally throughout michigan and the midwest to residential  commercial  industrial and wholesale customers 
factors impacting income power generation earnings increased million in and decreased million in  compared to the prior year 
as subsequently discussed  these results reflect changes in gross margins  increased operation and maintenance expenses  lower depreciation and amortization expenses and reduced property taxes 

table of contents in millions operating revenues fuel and purchased power gross margin operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes other than income operating income other income and deductions income tax provision cumulative effect of accounting change note net income operating income as a percent of operating revenues excludes merger and restructuring charges in and gross margins in improved million due primarily to significantly lower purchased power costs  partially offset by reduced operating revenues 
average purchased power cost per unit in declined per megawatthour mwh from levels 
the decline in revenues was due to a full year impact of a legislatively mandated rate reduction for commercial and industrial customers that began in april revenues from wholesale customers were reduced reflecting lower power prices 
revenues from retail customers were affected by customers switching to alternative suppliers under the electric customer choice program note 
partially offsetting these revenue reductions was the impact of weather  resulting in a increase in cooling demand during gross margins in declined by million reflecting lower operating revenues  slightly offset by lower fuel and purchased power costs 
the reduced operating revenues were due to the impact of an economic recession  the electric customer choice program and securitization 
sales rates for commercial and industrial customers were lowered by the rate reduction in april commercial and industrial sales decreased due to increased participation of customers in the electric customer choice program 
industrial sales also reflect reduced auto and steel production  and the end of a special energy sales agreement with a large steel manufacturer in march of partially offsetting these declines were increased revenues from residential and wholesale customers as well as higher revenues from providing other energy related services 
residential customer revenues reflect higher demand resulting from weather  partially offset by the impact of a rate reduction that began in june revenues from wholesale customers increased due to gains from settling forward sales contracts 
the sales contracts were entered into to effectively close forward purchase contracts that hedged power supply costs 
accordingly  the gains from forward sales contracts were substantially offset by losses from forward purchase contracts  which are recorded as part of fuel and purchased power costs 
fuel and purchased power costs were also affected by lower system output resulting from reduced electric sales  as well as the result of using a more favorable power supply mix 
the supply mix reflects an increased usage of lower cost power from our generating plants and reduced usage of higher cost purchased power

operation and maintenance expense increased million in and million in expense in both periods reflect an increase in planned and unplanned maintenance and reliability work for our power generation facilities  which reduces random outages at power plants and our reliance on purchased power 
additionally  both periods include higher employee pension and health care benefit costs  costs allocated from dte energy corporate for corporate support services  as well as the cost of funding the low income and energy efficiency fund 
the funding of the low income and energy efficiency program was required under michigan legislation and is recovered in current sales rates 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in and million in the declines reflect the extension of the amortization period from seven years to years for certain regulatory assets that were securitized in see note regulatory matters 
taxes other than income increased million in and decreased million in the decrease was due to lower property taxes resulting from new valuation tables approved by the michigan state tax commission stc 
several local taxing jurisdictions have taken legal action against the state of michigan to prevent the stc from implementing the new valuation tables 
see note commitments and contingencies 
outlook electric restructuring is expected to continue to result in increased customer choice in the retail electric generation business 
effective january   the electric customer choice program in michigan was expanded to allow all electric customers to purchase their electricity from suppliers other than their local utility 
as a result of customers choosing to participate in the electric customer choice program detroit edison lost of retail sales in and estimates losing to of such sales in if detroit edison is unable to recover its fixed costs from retail customers due to lost sales under electric customer choice stranded costs  michigan law allows for the recovery of all such amounts from electric customer choice customers 
detroit edison recorded a million regulatory asset in representing stranded costs and other recoverable costs under michigan legislation 
the regulatory asset was calculated based on a refinement to the methodology approved by the michigan public service commission mpsc 
the regulatory asset will be subject to review in future regulatory proceedings and we cannot predict the outcome of this matter

we continue to evaluate opportunities to sell interests in some or all of our synfuel plants 
sales of interests in synfuel projects allow us to accelerate cash flow while maintaining a stable net income base 
coke battery tax credits expired at two of our three facilities in and the synfuel tax credits are scheduled to expire in energy marketing trading energy marketing trading consists of the electric and gas marketing and trading operations of dte energy trading company and coenergy trading company  which was acquired as part of the mcn energy acquisition in may energy marketing trading focuses on physical power marketing and structured transactions  as well as the enhancement of returns from dte energy s natural gas pipeline and storage assets 
to this end  energy marketing trading enters into forwards  futures  swaps and option contracts as part of its trading strategy 
factors impacting income earnings decreased million in and increased million in due to varying mark to market gains resulting from changes in gas and electric prices 
commodity price risk of the energy marketing trading segment is managed by utilizing derivative financial contracts to offset the risk inherent in the segment s portfolio of electric and gas supply and sales agreements 
the segment s objective is to enter into new transactions that can be hedged and profitable from an economic standpoint 
energy marketing trading accounts for this risk minimization strategy by marking to market its commodity forwards and financial derivatives so they substantially offset 
this fair value accounting better aligns financial reporting with the way the business is managed and its performance measured 
in  energy marketing trading experienced earnings volatility as a result of its production related gas supply as well as from open positions related to its long term gas transportation and storage assets 
the segment receives gas produced from dte energy s exploration production e p operations which is used to meet its commitments under long term contracts with cogeneration customers 
the e p gas does not qualify for mark to market accounting 
energy marketing trading recorded a gain in totaling approximately million  net of taxes  primarily attributable to marking to market sales contracts with power generation customers without recording an offsetting loss from marking to market the production related gas supply 
in december  energy marketing trading entered into hedge transactions that substantially mitigate the earnings volatility related to the gas contracts with power generation customers 
energy marketing trading deploys a gas storage  marketing and trading strategy primarily utilizing the facilities owned and operated by dte energy 
employing a combination of physical and financial contracts  in conjunction with the injection and withdrawal capabilities of the storage fields  the segment is able to capture seasonal price spreads 
as forward prices change  the timing of the physical flow of gas is optimized to obtain the highest margin 
trades under this strategy are marked to market against the forward curve 
through december  physical gas in storage was marked to the current spot price under fair value accounting rules 
this difference in accounting for forward trades and gas in storage resulted in earnings volatility in and when price changes in the spot month did not correspond with those in future delivery months 
gas in storage in december was priced at a spot market rate of per thousand cubic feet mcf  compared to per mcf in december and a may   acquisition date rate of per mcf 
significantly smaller changes in forward prices occurred during these same periods 
as a result  the mark to market gains and losses on gas inventory were only partially offset by mark to market losses and gains on the storage related derivatives 
outlook energy marketing trading will seek to gradually expand this business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments 
gas storage and 
table of contents transportation capacity enhances its ability to provide reliable and custom tailored  bundled services to large volume end users and utilities 
this capacity  coupled with the synergies from dte energy s other businesses  positions the segment to capitalize on opportunities for expansion of its market base 
energy marketing trading manages commodity price risk by utilizing derivative financial contracts to more fully balance its portfolio of gas and electric supply and sales agreements 
energy marketing trading attempts to maintain a balanced  or flat book from an economic standpoint 
however  energy marketing trading will experience earnings volatility as a result of its gas inventories and associated hedges

in december  the mpsc issued an order that continues the gas customer choice program on a permanent and expanding basis beginning with the conclusion of the three year temporary program on march  under the expanded program  beginning april   up to approximately of customers could elect to purchase gas from suppliers other than michcon 
beginning in april  up to approximately of customers could participate and beginning april  all million of michcon s gas customers could choose to participate 
since michcon continues to transport and deliver the gas to the participating customer premises at prices comparable to margins earned on gas sales  customers switching to other suppliers have little impact on michcon s earnings 
as of december  approximately  customers were participating in the gas customer choice program 

table of contents under the mpsc order  michcon returned to a gas cost recovery gcr mechanism upon termination of its three year experimental gas sales program in december under the gcr mechanism  the gas commodity component of michcon s sales rates is designed to recover the actual costs of gas purchases 
in december  the mpsc issued an order permitting michcon to implement gcr factors up to per mcf for january billings and up to per mcf for the remainder of the order also allowed michcon to recognize a regulatory asset of approximately million representing the difference between the factor and the factor for volumes that were unbilled at december  the regulatory asset will be subject to the gcr reconciliation process

in addition  we use cash from operations to retire long term debt and pay dividends 
the increase in was attributable to higher net income  after adjusting for noncash items depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes  partially offset by higher working capital requirements 
working capital requirements reflect an increase in accounts receivable and gas inventories 
accounts receivable collections were slowed in our utility business due to billing issues associated with our new combined billing system that have been resolved 
the decline in resulted primarily from lower earnings  after adjusting for noncash items including merger and restructuring charges  and higher working capital requirements 
working capital was affected by the seasonal requirements in the second half of of the gas business where cash is used to finance increases in gas inventories and customer accounts receivable

section tax credits we have generated section tax credits from our synfuel  coke battery and biomass operations 
seven of our synthetic fuel facilities have received favorable private letter rulings from the internal revenue service irs with respect to their operations 
the remaining two rulings have been requested and are expected in these tax credits are subject to review by the irs and if we fail to prevail through the administrative and legal process  there could be a significant tax liability owed for previously taken section tax credits

goodwill certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired 
in order to perform these impairment tests  we must determine the reporting unit s fair value using valuation techniques  which use estimates of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit 
these cash flow estimates involve judgments based on a broad range of information and historical results 
to the extent estimated cash flows are revised downward  the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings 
as of december   our goodwill totaled billion and we determined that no impairment exists 
pension and postretirement costs our cost of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a number of factors  including rates of return on plan assets  the discount rate and the rate of increase in health care costs 
we had pension income for qualified pension plans of million in and pension expense of million in and million in postretirement benefits expense for all plans was million in  million in and million in pension and postretirement benefits expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets of at december  in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our consultants  including their review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond markets 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of in equity markets  in fixed income markets  and invested in other assets 
because of market volatility  we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate 
given market conditions we believe that is a reasonable long term rate of return on our plan assets  despite the recent financial market downturn 
we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions  including our expected rate of return  at least annually 

table of contents we base our determination of the expected return on plan assets for pension benefits on a market related valuation of assets which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic manner over a three year period 
because of this method  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
we have unrecognized net losses due to the recent unfavorable performance of the financial markets 
as of december   we had cumulative losses of approximately million which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
these unrecognized net losses may result in increases in our future pension expense 
the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from at december  to at december  due to recent financial market performance  lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates we estimate that our pension expense will approximate million and our postretirement benefit expense will approximate million 
we have also made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of the higher costs 
future actual pension and postretirement benefit expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets by would have increased our pension expense by approximately million and our postretirement benefit expense by million 
lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by would have increased our pension expense for by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate and the health care cost trend assumptions by would have decreased our postretirement benefit expense for by approximately million 
the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected by sharp declines in the financial markets since the value of our plan assets has decreased from billion at december   to billion at december  the investment performance returns and declining discount rates have required us to recognize at december   an additional minimum pension liability of million  an intangible asset of million and an entry to other comprehensive loss shareholders equity of million  net of tax 
the additional minimum pension liability and related accounting entries would be reversed on the balance sheet in future periods if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated pension benefit obligations 
the recording of the minimum pension liability does not affect net income or cash flow 
pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements will increase in future years without a substantial recovery in the financial markets 
we made a million cash contribution to the pension plan in and a million cash contribution in january we also contributed million to the postretirement plans in  and expect to contribute at million by the end of 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends  economic conditions  age of receivables and other information 
with the implementation of a new integrated billing system in late  we encountered billing issues that resulted in an mpsc inquiry 
we filed a plan with the mpsc in march addressing customer billing complaints 
while we have resolved the primary billing issues  we may encounter difficulty in collecting past due receivables 
as a result  our allowance for doubtful accounts increased in we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates  however  failure to collect our past due receivables could unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow 
environmental matters protecting the environment  as well as correcting past environmental damage  continues to be a focus of state and federal regulators 
legislation and or rulemaking could further impact the electric utility industry including detroit edison 
the environmental protection agency epa and the michigan department of environmental quality have aggressive programs to clean up contaminated property 
the epa initiated enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of new source provisions of the clean air act 
detroit edison received and responded to information requests from the epa on this subject 
the epa has not initiated proceedings against detroit edison 
the national energy policy development group is reviewing the epa s interpretation and application of regulations for new source review requirements
