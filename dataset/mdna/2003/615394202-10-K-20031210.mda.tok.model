on september   the company completed the offering and sale of  shares of class a common stock at per share 
the company used the net proceeds of million to pay a portion of the million purchase price of the company s september  acquisition of the poly scientific division of litton systems  inc  a subsidiary of northrop grumman corporation 
poly scientific is a manufacturer of motion control and data transmission devices  and its principal products are electrical and fiber optic slip rings  brushless dc motors and electromechanical actuators 
poly scientific had sales of approximately million for its year ended december  critical accounting policies estimates or judgments the company s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are affected by management s application of accounting policies  which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the critical accounting policies were reviewed with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition on long term contracts 
in  of the company s sales were accounted for using the percentage of completion cost to cost method of accounting for long term contracts which recognizes sales and costs as work is performed in advance of the delivery of the product 
the remaining sales were recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product transferred to the customer  principally as units were shipped 
the percentage of completion cost to cost method of accounting is used primarily on the company s aircraft and space contracts  which typically have longer performance cycles  resulting in the matching of sales with costs as they are incurred throughout the duration of the contract 
percentage of completion cost to cost accounting for long term contracts requires a disciplined cost estimating system in which all relevant functions of the business are involved 
the company believes it has adequate systems and procedures that result in reasonably dependable estimates of extent of progress toward completion  contract revenues and contract costs by contract 
the cost estimates rely on engineering and manufacturing assessments of progress achieved against technical or performance milestones  and are validated using applicable product or project cost history 
contract prices  or contract values  are generally based on the terms and conditions specified in the contract or in the related customer purchase orders 
however  the effort required under a contract can change during the performance period 
these changes are typically in the form of a directed scope change from the customer  or a claim by the company for an adjustment to the contract value based upon requirements that are different from the contract s baseline requirements 
the company includes an estimate of scope changes or claims in the contract value for purposes of revenue recognition only when that amount can be reliably estimated and when realization is considered probable 
at september   the amount of unnegotiated scope changes or claims included in contract values on firm fixed price contracts which are used in the determination of sales and operating profit was not material 
the company reviews contract cost estimates and contract values  including unnegotiated claims and scope changes  on a quarterly basis 
as a result of these reviews  sales and costs of sales are recorded in the statement of earnings to reflect the most current assessment of each contract s percentage of completion 
contract loss reserves 
for contracts for which the estimated costs at completion  exclusive of allocated general and administrative period costs  exceed the estimated contract value  a loss reserve for the entire remaining loss is recorded when the loss becomes known 
loss reserves are more common on firm fixed price contracts that involve  to varying degrees  the design and development of new and unique controls or control systems to meet customers specifications 
the determination of contract loss reserves is made on a specific contract basis and  therefore  no general reserves are maintained 
once established  the amount of the loss reserve is reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted  if necessary  based on progress made and on updated cost estimates including a current assessment of any remaining risks 
provisions for losses on contracts are reflected in the statement of earnings as additional cost of sales 
as costs are incurred  the previously established contract loss reserve included in current liabilities is reduced 
at september   contract loss reserves were million 
reserves for inventory valuation 
at september   inventories represented approximately of total assets and of current assets 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market with cost determined primarily on the first in  first out method of valuation 
the company records valuation reserves to provide for slow moving or obsolete inventory by using both a formula based method that increases the valuation reserve as the inventory ages and  supplementally  a specific identification method 
determining the appropriate reserve for inventory valuation requires significant knowledge of the business 
management considers overall inventory levels in relation to firm customer backlog as well as forecasted demand including consideration of aftermarket sales 
inventory obsolescence reserves also consider issues such as low demand or technological obsolescence 
the company s inventory valuation reserve represents a reduction in inventory cost which creates a new cost basis of accounting 
the reserve amount is maintained in a general ledger account separate from the gross inventory cost 
once a reserve is established for an inventory item  it is removed upon the subsequent use or disposition of the item 
at september   the reserve for inventory valuation was million  or of gross inventories 
reviews for impairment of goodwill 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
at september   the company had million of goodwill 
in testing for impairment of goodwill  companies are required to allocate goodwill among reporting units  estimate fair values of those reporting units and determine their carrying values 
the company s reporting units are the operating segments used for segment reporting aircraft controls  space controls and industrial controls 
this determination was made based on the similarities of the components of these groups as well as the components not qualifying as businesses themselves 
the process of evaluating the company s goodwill for potential impairment is subjective and requires significant estimates 
these estimates include judgments about future cash flows of the reporting units and allocations of commonly shared assets to the reporting units  as well as the estimates of the cost of capital used to discount future cash flows 
based on the discounted present values of the projected cash flows  the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the respective carrying value resulting in no impairment of the company s goodwill 
pension assumptions 
the company maintains defined benefit plans in six countries covering substantially all employees 
the us plans represent of the consolidated projected benefit obligation at september  the accounting for these plans is based in part on certain assumptions that may be highly uncertain and may have a material impact on the financial statements if different reasonable assumptions had been used 
the assumption for return on assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
the assumed return on assets of used in for the us plans was determined with reference to the fund s investment mix at september  of equities and fixed income securities  along with forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
the assumption took the market s poor performance in and into consideration 
had the company selected a return on assets that was one percentage point lower  pension expense for us plans for would have been million higher than the amount recorded 
in addition to the return on assets assumption  assumptions for the rate of compensation increase and discount rate were made 
the rate of compensation increase used in determining the pension cost was for the us plans and was determined using a long term projection for inflation in addition to real wage increase assumptions 
the discount rate used in determining the pension cost was for us plans 
consistent with prior years  the company used the aa corporate bond rate as the discount rate for us plans 
at september   the discount rate used to value the projected benefit obligation was 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
at september   the company had total gross deferred tax assets of million 
these assets relate principally to domestic liabilities or asset valuation reserves including pension and vacation accruals  inventory obsolescence  bad debt reserves and contract loss reserves 
based on recent historical earnings performance and current projections  management believes that a valuation allowance is not required against the domestic portion of these deferred tax assets  which totaled million at september  deferred tax assets recorded at september  by the company s foreign subsidiaries totaled million  of which million relates to net operating losses in luxembourg 
the company had a million valuation allowance recorded against this asset at september  representing of the gross asset related to net operating losses 
management believes this reserve is adequate after considering recent operating performance  future financial projections  tax planning strategies and the allowable tax carryforward period 
other than the deferred tax assets related to net operating losses in luxembourg and based on recent historical earnings performance and current projections  management believes that a valuation allowance is not required against the other million of the foreign portion of deferred tax assets

net sales for increased to million from million in sales increased by million in aircraft controls and million in industrial controls  while sales decreased by million in space controls 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to lower sales levels and an unfavorable product mix in space controls and higher sales on the f joint strike fighter aircraft program which is a cost plus contract with modest margins  offset partially by benefits from cost savings initiatives within industrial controls 
estimated costs to complete are reviewed quarterly for contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion cost to cost method of accounting 
for those contracts with anticipated losses at completion  a contract loss reserve is recorded when the loss becomes known 
additions to contract loss reserves are reflected in the statement of earnings in cost of sales 
additions to contract loss reserves were million in compared to million in half of the additions in relates to increased cost estimates on business jet development contracts 
the balance of the additions primarily relates to other aircraft development contracts 
during  million of contract loss reserves  primarily on business jet development contracts  were utilized as costs were incurred and were reflected as reductions to the previously established contract loss reserves  compared to million in reserves for inventory valuation are recorded for obsolete or slow moving inventory 
additions to reserves were million in compared to million in reductions to reserves resulting from inventory being disposed were million in and in most of the inventory disposed had been previously reserved 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the lower level of research and development primarily relates to completion of a pump and motor design for military aircraft applications and controls for unmanned combat aircraft  both which peaked in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in the increase primarily relates to commissions  personnel related costs  travel costs  the june paris air show  professional services and bid and proposal costs related primarily to the boeing e interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to lower interest rates including the effects of the company s use of its available credit facility to redeem its million senior subordinated notes on may  other expense of million in includes million for the write off of deferred debt issuance costs related to the million senior subordinated notes that were redeemed at par on may  other expense is net of a third quarter million gain on a sale of land 
the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in the decrease in the effective tax rate resulted from state investment tax credits realized in  benefits related to the reorganization of the company s european operations and to a higher level of additional export tax benefits that the company claimed on amended us tax returns 
these benefits were partially offset by a million valuation allowance adjustment related to deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses in luxembourg 
in  net earnings increased to million from million in diluted earnings per share  or eps  increased to in from in diluted weighted average shares outstanding were higher in compared to due to the exercise of options  the sale of class a common stock on september  and a higher dilutive effect of outstanding stock options related to the higher price of class a common stock 
aircraft controls 
net sales in aircraft controls increased to million in from million in military aircraft sales increased million to million  while commercial aircraft sales decreased million to million 
the increase in military aircraft sales is primarily due to a million increase in sales for primary flight controls and the leading edge flap actuation system on the f joint strike fighter development program and a million increase on the v tilt rotor osprey related to the replacement of swashplate actuators to the customer s latest specifications 
the net increase on other military aircraft programs was million  and included increases in sales of controls for military engines and subassemblies for the f in japan 
the decrease in commercial aircraft sales is primarily due to a million decrease in boeing oem sales due to lower production rates 
operating margins for aircraft controls decreased to in from in the decrease in operating margins is primarily attributable to higher sales on the f joint strike fighter program which is a cost plus contract with modest margins 
twelve month backlog for aircraft controls was million at september  compared to million at september  the increase is due to increases in backlog on military programs including the f joint strike fighter  partially offset by decreases on commercial aircraft programs 
space controls 
net sales in space controls decreased to million in from million in the lower level of sales primarily relates to decreases of million in controls for satellites reflecting the soft commercial satellite market and last year s completion of the gravity probe b program  million on tactical missile programs including the agm popeye  hellfire and vt  and million on the crew return vehicle 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million on the ground based midcourse defense program 
operating margins for space controls decreased to in from in the decrease in margins primarily relates to the decrease in sales  most significantly in sales of controls for satellites 
to a lesser extent  the decrease in margins is attributable to cost overruns on commercial satellite programs and a less favorable product mix 
operating margins were a loss in the fourth quarter of compared to a profit in the fourth quarter of the decrease in fourth quarter operating margins primarily resulted from a decrease in fourth quarter sales 
twelve month backlog for space controls was million at september  and at september  industrial controls 
net sales in industrial controls increased to million in from million in the increase occurred despite a million decrease in sales of controls for turbines primarily in the us  with other markets  primarily in europe and the pacific region  generating a net increase of million  including a million beneficial impact related to stronger foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
including the currency effect  the sales growth primarily consists of increases of million in sales of controls for plastics machinery  million through distributors  million in combat controls for military vehicles  million in controls for presses and metal forming equipment and million in aftermarket 
operating margins for industrial controls increased to in from in the improvement in margins is primarily a result of benefits realized from cost reduction initiatives and a more favorable product mix 
twelve month backlog for industrial controls was million at september  and at september  excluding the impact of foreign currencies  backlog decreased million from a year ago primarily related to the timing of combat controls orders for us programs 
compared to references to cost of sales as a percentage of net sales  net earnings  diluted eps and operating margins in the following discussion of results of operations for compared to reflect the exclusion of goodwill amortization for goodwill amortization expense was million in consolidated 
net sales for increased to million from million in sales increased by million in aircraft controls and million in space controls  while sales decreased by million in industrial controls 
net sales for included incremental sales of million from industrial and space related acquisitions 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to a favorable change in product mix towards more profitable military aircraft sales  in particular aftermarket sales 
in  sales of controls for military aircraft represented of net sales compared to of net sales in in addition  operating losses narrowed on business jets  in part due to a favorable million adjustment in the third quarter of related to progress made on certain scope change negotiations 
these improvements were partially offset by weak margins for industrial products due primarily to lower sales 
additions to contract loss reserves were million in  mostly related to unforeseen expanded work requirements on certain firm fixed price commercial business jet development contracts 
the company also recorded million of contract loss reserves related to acquisitions as part of purchase accounting 
during  million of contract loss reserves  primarily related to business jet development contracts  were utilized as costs were incurred and were reflected as reductions to the previously established contract loss reserve included in current liabilities 
contract loss reserves were also reduced by million related to progress made on certain scope change negotiations for business jet development contracts 
the net decrease in contract loss reserves was million in  compared to a net decrease of million in the net increase in reserves for inventory valuation was million in  compared to a net increase of million in additions to the reserve in were million higher compared to the increase is primarily within the aircraft controls segment  and to a lesser extent  the industrial controls segment where product specifications or projected future demand have changed during the year resulting in inventory levels that  in management s estimation  are in excess of amounts needed to fulfill existing and future sales requirements 
reductions to the reserve resulting from inventory being disposed were million less in as compared to  primarily in the space controls segment 
most of this inventory had been previously reserved and the reserve balance was relieved when the inventory was disposed 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the higher levels of research and development related primarily to a variety of aircraft controls initiatives  including a new flap actuation system for the business jet market  a new pump and motor design for military aircraft applications  controls for unmanned combat aircraft and active vibration controls for helicopters 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in the increase is primarily attributable to higher personnel related costs  including costs related to a stock based deferred compensation plan for certain officers and directors  and higher professional fees 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense is due to lower interest rates and reduced debt levels  each contributing approximately equally to the decrease 
the reduced debt levels are primarily related to million of net proceeds from the november equity offering in addition to million of reduced net debt levels related to cash flow from operations 
other expense was million in compared to zero in the increase is primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange losses in the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in the decrease in the effective tax rate relates to additional export tax benefits that the company claimed in on amended  and us tax returns and a reorganization of the company s european operations 
this decrease was partially offset by a first quarter charge related to decreasing a deferred tax asset in europe for a change in a statutory tax rate enacted in during the fourth quarter  additional tax benefits related to the distribution of foreign earnings were offset by a valuation allowance adjustment related to deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses in luxembourg 
in  net earnings increased to million from million in diluted eps increased to in from in diluted weighted average shares outstanding were higher in compared to primarily due to the sale of class a common stock on november  aircraft controls 
net sales in aircraft controls increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to a million increase in sales on fighter aircraft programs  an million increase in military aftermarket sales  related primarily to the f fighter aircraft and the black hawk helicopter  and a million increase in sales to oems for the black hawk and sea hawk helicopter programs 
the million increase in sales on fighter aircraft programs consists primarily of million on the f joint strike fighter  million on the f and million on the f a e f programs 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in boeing oem sales resulting from lower build rates  million  or  in commercial aftermarket sales related to the reduced number of commercial airplane flights  million in flight controls for airbus and million related to business jets 
operating margins for aircraft controls increased to in from in the increase is primarily a result of the higher levels of military aftermarket sales  narrowed operating losses on business jets  including a favorable million adjustment in the third quarter of related to progress on certain scope change negotiations  and better margins on certain fighter aircraft as production rates increase 
twelve month backlog for aircraft controls was million at september  compared to million at september  the increase is due to an increase on the f joint strike fighter  partially offset by a decrease for commercial aircraft 
space controls 
net sales in space controls increased to million in from million in an million increase during the first nine months of was partially offset by a decrease of million in the fourth quarter of resulting from lower sales of controls for tactical missiles and  to a lesser extent  satellites 
the increase in sales for the year is primarily due to increases of million for satellite controls  all related to acquisitions  million on the space shuttle refurbishment effort and million on the hellfire tactical missile program 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in sales of controls for launch vehicles related to the wind down on the titan iv program and lower development activity on evolved expendable launch vehicle programs 
operating margins for space controls decreased to in from in the decrease in margins is primarily related to poor operating performance on contracts associated with the perkinelmer acquisition in and lower sales in the fourth quarter of that resulted in fourth quarter operating margins of 
these decreases were partially offset by increases due to higher volume and better cost experience on the space shuttle refurbishment effort and favorable cost performance on the crew return vehicle  which was nearing completion  and tactical missile programs such as hellfire  tow and agm popeye 
twelve month backlog for space controls was million at september  compared to million at september  the decrease primarily relates to programs that were near completion such as the crew return vehicle and reduced orders for satellites and tactical missiles such as the agm popeye  which was completed  and the hellfire missile program that had entered a production break 
industrial controls 
net sales in industrial controls decreased to million in from million in the decrease in sales associated with the global industrial economic slowdown included a million decrease for controls for motion simulators  a million decrease for controls for plastic injection molding machinery  a million decrease for electric drives and a million decrease for turbine controls 
these decreases were partially offset by an million increase in sales for combat controls and million of incremental sales from acquisitions 
operating margins for industrial controls decreased to in from in the decrease in margins resulted from low volume in industrial markets and an unfavorable product mix weighted more towards lower margin standard products 
twelve month backlog for industrial controls was million at september  compared to million at september  excluding the impact of the acquisition of tss and foreign currency exchange  backlog decreased by million primarily due to generally soft industrial markets 
financial condition and liquidity on march   the company increased its revolving and term loan credit facility to million 
the term loan portion of the credit facility  which had a balance of million at december   was increased to million with the difference reducing the outstanding balance on the revolving portion of the facility to million 
interest on outstanding credit facility borrowings is based on libor plus the applicable margin  which increased basis points and is currently basis points 
the credit facility expires on march  and requires quarterly principal payments on the term loan of million 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s us assets 
at september   the term loan had a balance of million and the revolver had a balance of million 
the credit facility contains various covenants 
the covenant for minimum consolidated net worth  defined as the sum of capital stock and additional paid in capital plus retained earnings  adjusts over the term of the facility and was million as of september  the covenant for minimum interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of adjusted ebitda to total interest expense for the most recent four quarters  is the covenant for minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of i adjusted ebitda minus capital expenditures to ii the sum of interest expense  income tax expense and regularly scheduled principal payments on debt  all of the most recent four quarters  is the covenant for the maximum leverage ratio  defined as the ratio of total debt including letters of credit less cash to adjusted ebitda for the most recent four quarters  is the covenant for maximum capital expenditures is million in any one fiscal year 
adjusted ebitda is defined as i the sum of net income  interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation expense  amortization expense and other non cash items reducing net income minus ii other non cash items increasing net income 
at september   the company was in compliance with all covenants 
on may   the company completed the early redemption of the million senior subordinated notes at par 
the redemption was financed by using the unused portion of the credit facility with interest at libor plus basis points 
on september   the company completed the offering and sale of  shares of class a common stock at a price of per share 
the company used the net proceeds of approximately million to pay a portion of the purchase price of the company s september  acquisition of the poly scientific division of litton systems  inc  a subsidiary of northrop grumman corporation 
after completion of the offering and sale of class a common stock on september   the company s shelf registration statement filed on august  allows the company to register an additional million of class a common stock or debt securities 
at september   the company had million of unused borrowing capacity  including million from the credit facility and million from a bridge loan that allows for a one time draw to finance the poly scientific acquisition 
the company s million of cash at september  was unusually large as most of the million of proceeds from the sale of class a common stock on september  remained in cash until the acquisition of poly scientific on september  the million purchase price of poly scientific was paid on september  by increasing borrowings on the credit facility by million  using cash of million and by borrowing million on the bridge loan 
after the acquisition  the company s unused borrowing capacity was reduced to million 
total debt  net of cash  was million at september   or million after considering the september  acquisition  compared to million at september  the reduction in net debt from september  to september  primarily relates to million of net proceeds from the sale of class a common stock and million of cash generated by operations net of capital expenditures 
long term debt to capitalization was at september  and after the acquisition on september   compared to at september cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash from operations was primarily due to the increase in earnings adjusted for non cash charges  increased customer advances and a tax refund primarily related to significant deductions for pension contributions and accelerated depreciation  offset by other changes in working capital 
net property  plant and equipment was million at september  compared to million at september  capital expenditures in were million compared with depreciation and amortization of million 
capital expenditures in were million compared with depreciation and amortization of million in capital expenditures in are not expected to exceed million 
the company believes its cash on hand  cash flows from operations and available borrowings under short and long term lines of credit will continue to be sufficient to meet its operating needs

outlook during its november  conference call for its year end earnings release  the company provided the following outlook for fiscal net sales in are forecasted to grow to between million and million  a to increase over sales are expected to grow as a result of the poly scientific acquisition in addition to experiencing growth in each segment 
moog s components segment previously referred to as poly scientific is forecasted to contribute million in sales during aircraft controls sales are expected to increase to million  reflecting an increase in military aftermarket sales resulting from the release of funding for programs on which the company participates 
the increase is expected to be partially offset by decreases on the v osprey and f fighter aircraft programs  both of which provided strong sales in space controls sales are expected to increase to million related to increases on the space shuttle as the program prepares to resume launches  strategic missiles related to minuteman iii refurbishments  and tactical missiles for which the company has a new order for maverick missile hardware 
decreases in missile defense and launch vehicles are expected to partially offset increases in sales within space controls 
industrial controls sales are expected to increase between and  or to between million and million  with the range partially reflecting potential volatility of major currencies such as the euro and yen 
operating margins for are expected to be between and 
aircraft controls operating margins are expected to decrease from to  reflecting a slightly less favorable mix 
space controls operating margins are expected to remain around break even 
industrial controls operating margins are expected to increase over to between and based on product mix 
operating margins for moog s components segment are expected to be after considering amortization of intangible assets and the short term effect of the opening balance sheet write up of inventory 
net earnings for are expected to be between million and million 
diluted earnings per share for are expected to be between and  representing an increase between and over due to the sale of  shares of class a common stock on september   weighted average shares outstanding will be higher in than in net earnings and diluted earnings per share are expected to increase between and in each of the first two quarters of compared to the respective quarters of and between and in the third and fourth quarters of compared to the third and fourth quarters of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  in the normal course of business  has exposures to interest rate risks from its long term debt obligations and foreign exchange rate risk with respect to its foreign operations and from foreign currency transactions 
to minimize these risks  the company may enter into derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and forward contracts 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
for the year ended september   the company s exposure to derivatives was primarily limited to interest rate swaps that were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges 
the company s borrowings under variable interest rate facilities were million at september  in order to provide for interest rate protection  the company has interest rate swap agreements 
of the million notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at september   million matures in the second quarter of  million matures in the second quarter of and million matures in the first quarter of based on the current applicable margin  the interest rate swaps effectively convert these amounts of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at  and  respectively  through their maturities  at which times the interest will revert back to a variable rate based on libor plus the applicable margin 
if interest rates had changed by one percentage point  the impact on consolidated interest expense from the company s variable rate debt would have been approximately million in although the majority of the company s sales  expenses and cash flows are transacted in us dollars  the company does have some market risk exposure with respect to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as it relates to the value of the us dollar versus the euro  the japanese yen and the british pound 
if average annual foreign exchange rates were to collectively weaken or strengthen against the us dollar by  net earnings would be reduced or increased  respectively  by approximately million related to currency exchange rate translation exposures and million related to pressures on operating margins for products sourced in non us countries 
the company uses on a limited basis forward contracts to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party raw material purchases  intercompany product shipments and intercompany loans and to reduce fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in  and long term advances to  subsidiaries 
at september   there were no significant contracts outstanding
