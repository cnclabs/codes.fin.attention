to grow its business  the company intends to i expand the marketing and tour volume of its existing student and sports travel programs  ii introduce new student and sport travel programs and strategic alliances  iii expand its professional travel programs  and iv pursue acquisition opportunities 
expand the marketing and tour volume of existing student and sports travel programs us census data projects that there will be more than million people in the to year old age range by the company believes that a large number of qualified students in this age group are not aware of the company s youth travel programs 
in light of these factors  the company intends to improve its marketing techniques by targeting additional age groups  making greater use of referrals from teachers  parents and past student travelers  and expanding and refining its extensive databases of potential participants 
introduce new student and sports travel programs and strategic alliances the company continually seeks to develop and introduce additional innovative  educational travel experiences 
the company intends to continue to maintain its contacts with foreign governmental agencies and officials and intends to continue to utilize these and other foreign contacts to organize opportunities for its program participants that other travel programs do not currently offer 
in addition  the company may develop new youth travel programs organized around common extracurricular activities such as sports  science  nature  and music 
broaden professional travel programs according to us census data  the number of americans to years old is expected to grow substantially  increasing to more than million people in from million people in this trend is expected to benefit the company  since this population segment historically has been the most likely to participate in one of the company s professional travel programs

the company also intends to develop alliances with partners that have strong brand recognition and access to well defined customer segments 
pursue acquisition opportunities the company considers the industries encompassed by its business to be large and fragmented  which present attractive acquisition opportunities 
the company believes that the industry s large size and fragmentation will facilitate acquisitions of businesses that are either compatible with the company s current business or represent a developing specialty segment not currently addressed by the company s operations 
competition the travel industry in general  and the educational segment of the travel industry in particular  is highly competitive 
the company s student programs compete with similar educational travel programs operated by other individuals and organizations  as well as independent programs organized and sponsored by local teachers with the assistance of local travel agents 
the company s sports programs compete with independent organizations  which organize and travel already intact teams for international competition 
the company s professional programs compete with independent professional associations that sponsor and organize their own travel programs through the assistance of local travel agents  and other organizations that design travel programs for adults 
the company believes that the principal basis of competition in the educational segment of the market is the quality and uniqueness of the educational program offered  customer service  reputation and program cost 
the company believes that its agreements with people to people  as well as its years of experience organizing student and professional educational programs and established relationships with public officials  organizations and residents in countries in which it provides programs  allow the company to provide an educational opportunity that is not easily duplicated by competitors programs

forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company s actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors  include among others  those identified under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
risks relating to group s business war with iraq the threat of and a possible war with iraq has and will affect the travel industry  the markets in which the company operates  and the company s operations and profitability 
the potential and long term effects are uncertain for the company s customers  the market for the company s common stock  the markets for the company s services  the strength of the us dollar and the us economy 
the company has experienced increased cancellations for its future travel programs and a weakened us dollar 
the negative effect of a weakened us dollar will cost the company more to travel participants abroad 
the consequences of a possible war with iraq are unpredictable and the company may not be able to foresee events that may have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations of the company 
terrorism terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred on september   the response by the united states and other acts of violence or war have and will affect the travel industry generally  the markets in which the company operates  the company s operations and profitability 
further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses at home and abroad may occur 
the september attacks have had a very negative impact on domestic and international air travel and the travel industry in general 
as a result  the company experienced a significant decrease in profitability in the potential near term and long term effects of these attacks are uncertain for the company s customers  the market for the company s common stock  the markets for our services and the us economy 
the consequences of any terrorist attacks  or any armed conflicts including war which may result  are unpredictable  and the company may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on its business or operations 
international operations and natural occurrences  travel industry the company s operations are subject to special risks inherent in doing business internationally  as substantially all of the company s travel programs are conducted outside the united states 
such risks include the adverse effects on operations from war  international and domestic terrorism  civil disturbances  political instability  governmental activities and deprivation of contract rights 
periods of international and domestic unrest  such as those caused by and following the attacks on september   have reduced demand for the company s travel programs and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
examples of such past events include the gulf war in  civil unrest in china in and the chernobyl disaster in in the past  gross receipts from programs to europe  the south pacific australia and new zealand and china have accounted for a majority of the company s gross receipts 
the occurrence of any of the events described above or other 
table of contents unforeseen developments in one or more of these regions would have a material adverse effect on the company 
demand for the company s travel programs also may be adversely affected by natural occurrences such as hurricanes  earthquakes  epidemics and flooding in geographic regions in which the company conducts its travel programs 
the company s results of operations will depend upon factors affecting the travel industry in general 
the company s revenues and earnings are especially sensitive to events that affect domestic and international air travel and the level of hotel reservations 
a number of factors  including those mentioned above  a rise in fuel prices or other travel costs  excessive inflation  currency fluctuations  extreme weather conditions and concerns about passenger safety could result in a temporary or longer term overall decline in demand for the company s travel programs 
demand for the company s products and services may be significantly affected by the general level of economic activity and employment in the united states and key international markets 
therefore  any significant economic downturn or recession in the united states or these other markets could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations of the company 
seasonality  fluctuations in quarterly results the company s businesses are highly seasonal 
the company recognizes gross program receipts  revenues and program pass through expenses upon the departure of its program participants 
the majority of the company s travel programs are scheduled in june and july of each year  and the company anticipates that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future 
substantially all of the company s operating income is generated in this period  which historically has offset the operating losses incurred during the rest of the year 
the company s annual results would be adversely affected if the company s revenues were to be substantially below seasonal norms during the second and third quarters of the year 
the company s operating results may fluctuate as a result of many factors  including the mix of student  sports  and professional programs and program destinations offered by the company and its competitors  the introduction and acceptance of new programs and program enhancements by the company and its competitors  timing of program completions  cancellation rates  competitive conditions in the industry  marketing expenses  extreme weather conditions  international or domestic conflicts  timing of and costs related to acquisitions  changes in relationships with certain travel providers  economic factors and other considerations affecting travel 
in addition  the company records on a quarterly basis realized gains and losses on its forward foreign exchange contracts that do not qualify as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
as a result of the foregoing  annual or quarterly operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the common stock could be materially and adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competition the travel industry in general and the educational segment of the travel industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry 
the company competes with other companies that provide similar educational travel programs for students as well as independent programs organized and sponsored by local teachers with the assistance of local travel agents 
under the terms of the company s agreement with people to people  people to people reserves the right to offer programs to college students for studies abroad and to grant other entities which compete with the company  the right to use the people to people name in connection with people to people s professional education and sports programs 
in general  the company s professional travel programs compete with independent professional organizations that sponsor and organize their own travel programs through the assistance of local travel agents  and other organizations that offer travel programs for adults 
some of the company s competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition and financial resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully  and the failure to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations of the company 
dependence on people to people the company s agreements with people to people give the company the exclusive right to develop and conduct programs for kindergarten through high school students using the people to people name  and the non exclusive right to develop and conduct programs for professionals  college age  and athletes using the people to people name 
the company s agreements with people to people  however  allow people to people to continue to conduct college and professional seminars and internship programs and to develop other sports and professional programs 
the people to people agreements expire in and  at the election of the company  may be further extended through the company believes that it derives benefit from its ability to market its programs using the people to people name 
if the company s 
table of contents agreements with people to people were terminated or if the company was unable to use the people to people name to market new programs or destinations  it could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
dependence on travel suppliers the company is dependent upon travel suppliers for access to their products and services 
travel suppliers include airlines  hotels  bus lines and other participants in the travel industry 
consistent with industry practices  the company currently has no long term agreements with its travel suppliers that obligate such suppliers to sell services or products through the company on an ongoing basis 
therefore  the company s travel suppliers generally can cancel or modify their agreements with the company upon relatively short notice 
in addition  any decline in the quality of travel products and services provided by these suppliers  or a perception by travelers of such a decline  could adversely affect the company s reputation 
the loss of contracts  changes in the company s pricing agreements  commission schedules or incentive override commission arrangements  more restricted access to travel suppliers products and services or less favorable public opinion of certain travel suppliers and resulting low demand for the products and services of such travel suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations of the company 
dependence on key personnel the company s performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and performances of its senior management and certain other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not have long term employment agreements with any of its executive officers 
the company s future success also depends on its ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate other highly skilled managerial  marketing and customer service personnel 
the failure to retain and attract necessary managerial  marketing and customer service personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
marketing the company s performance is substantially dependent on effectiveness of its direct marketing efforts including but not limited to direct mail and local informational meetings 
failure of its marketing effort could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
government regulation and taxation many travel suppliers  particularly airlines  are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and foreign governments 
in addition  the travel industry is subject to certain seller of travel laws of certain states and special taxes by federal  state  local and foreign governments  including hotel bed taxes  car rental taxes  airline excise taxes and airport taxes and fees 
new or different regulatory schemes or changes in tax policy could have an adverse impact on the travel industry in general and could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations of the company 
fluctuation of currency exchange rates increased costs many of the company s arrangements with its foreign based suppliers require payment to be made in foreign currencies 
any decrease in the value of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies has the effect of increasing the cost of the services to be provided 
since late  the company generally has purchased forward contracts with less than two years maturity to help manage program costs and hedge against foreign currency valuation increases 
while the ability to utilize forward contracts for the delivery of foreign currencies can mitigate the effect of increased program costs and foreign currency exchange fluctuations  there can be no assurance that increased program costs relating to such currency fluctuations will not be substantial in future periods 
there can also be no assurance the company s hedging strategy will mitigate longer term foreign exchange valuation trends 
the company s contract with participants in its travel programs provides the company the option of passing along to participants any increase in program costs resulting from currency fluctuations 
although the company has exercised this option in the past  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase program prices to offset any such cost increases in the future and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents casualty losses due to the nature of its business  the company may be subject to liability claims arising out of accidents or disasters causing injury to participants in its programs  including claims for serious personal injury or death 
the company believes that it has adequate liability insurance for risks arising in the normal course of its business 
although there have been no claims the company has experienced for which it did not have adequate insurance coverage  there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more large claims or that the applicable insurer will be solvent at the time of any covered loss 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and cost in the future 
successful assertion against the company of one or a series of large uninsured claims  or of one or a series of claims exceeding any insurance coverage  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
see business insurance 
growth  acquisitions and alliances the company s performance is dependent on ability to grow its business and expand the marketing and tour volume of its student  sports and professional travel programs 
in addition  the company s ability to grow is dependent on ability to acquire or enter into strategic alliances 
failure of growth strategies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
control of the company by certain stockholders as of february   john ueberroth  joseph ueberroth and peter ueberroth all family members beneficially own in the aggregate approximately of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
accordingly  they have the ability to exercise effective voting control of the company  and could be able to elect all of the company s directors and be able to determine the outcome of any matter being voted upon by the company s stockholders  including any merger  sale of assets or other change in control of the company 
the ueberroths ownership position  together with the antitakeover effects of certain provisions contained in the company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company 
risks relating to the separation of group from ambassadors indemnification of ambassadors for tax liabilities incurred in connection with the distribution in connection with the distribution  the company and ambassadors entered into a tax sharing agreement pursuant to which the company agreed to indemnify ambassadors for certain taxes and similar obligations that it could incur if the distribution does not qualify for tax free treatment due to any of the following events the acquisition of a controlling interest in group stock after the distribution  group s failure to continue its business after the distribution  a repurchase of group stock  or other acts or omissions by the company 
internal revenue service regulations provide that if another person or group acquires a or greater interest in the company s stock within two years of the distribution  a presumption will arise that the acquisition was made in connection with the distribution  causing the distribution to become taxable to ambassadors 
this presumption may deter other companies from acquiring the company for two years after the distribution 
in addition  ambassadors agreed to indemnify the company for any tax liabilities the company incurs as a result of its operations and ambassadors operations prior to the company s separation from ambassadors 
nevertheless  the company may be held jointly and severally liable for such liabilities  and it cannot make any assurances that it will be able to recover from ambassadors any losses it may suffer 
if the company takes any action or fails to take any action that would cause ambassadors distribution of the company s common stock to be taxable to ambassadors  the company s financial condition could be seriously harmed 

table of contents group s historical financial information may not be representative of its results as a separate company group s financial statements  as of december   and for the period january  through february   have been carved out from the consolidated financial statements of ambassadors using the historical operating results and historical bases of the assets and liabilities of the ambassadors business that group comprised 
accordingly  the historical financial information of the company does not necessarily reflect the company s financial position  operating results and cash flows as if the company had been a separate  stand alone entity during the periods presented 
the company s costs and expenses include allocations from ambassadors for centralized corporate services and infrastructure costs  including legal  accounting  insurance  finance and information technology 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note these allocations were determined on bases that ambassadors and the company consider to be reasonable reflections of the utilization of services provided to or for the benefit received by the company 
the historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the company s operating results  financial position and cash flows will be in the future 
while the company has made certain adjustments to its historical financial information  it has not made all of the necessary adjustments to its historical financial information to reflect all significant changes that will occur in its cost structure  funding and operations as a result of its separation from ambassadors  including increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale  increased marketing expenses related to building a company brand identity separate from ambassadors and increased costs associated with being a publicly traded  stand alone company 
reliance on ambassadors to fund future capital requirements  availability of future financing in the past  group has been able to satisfy its own capital requirements without assistance from ambassadors 
in connection with the distribution  ambassadors agreed to provide a credit facility to group in the amount of million through august in addition  allocations of cash at the time of the distribution were as follows i group retained the cash required to operate travel programs for which it had received participant deposits or paid vendor deposits and ii group retained an amount equal to the cash required for group s post separation operations 
ambassadors retained the remaining cash not specifically allocated to group pursuant to allocations as outlined in i and ii above 
the measurements or estimates for the preceding allocations were made as of february  following the distribution  and except as discussed below  group no longer has the option of relying on ambassadors to finance its capital requirements 
the company believes that its capital requirements will vary from quarter to quarter  depending on  among other things  capital expenditures  fluctuations in operating results  financing activities  acquisitions  investments and receivables management 
the company believes that its future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital  capital expenditure and product development requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  the company may require or choose to obtain additional debt or equity financing in order to finance acquisitions or other investments in its business 
future equity financings would be dilutive to the existing holders of group common stock 
future debt financings could involve restrictive covenants 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain financing with interest rates as favorable as those that ambassadors could obtain or that the company will be able to obtain financing at all 
ambassadors inability to fund the credit facility could have a material adverse effect on the company as part of the distribution  ambassadors agreed to provide a credit facility in the amount of million to the company through august ambassadors ability to fund the credit facility could be impaired due to a variety of factors including sudden capital expenditures  fluctuations in operating results  financing activities and receivables management 
to the extent any one of these factors caused an impairment in ambassadors ability to fund all or part of the million  the company would be forced to seek and obtain alternative financing in the form of debt or equity 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in obtaining alternative financing on favorable terms  or at all

company s directors may have conflicts of interest due to their dual service as directors of ambassadors international all but one of the company s directors also serves as directors and in one instance an executive officer of ambassadors 
whenever a director of the company serves as an executive officer or director of another entity such as ambassadors  there is the potential for a conflict of interest  ie  that the fiduciary obligations of an individual to ambassadors conflict with the fiduciary obligations to the company and vice versa 
involvement by these same individuals in the affairs of ambassadors specifically creates demands on their time and resources  which may be needed for the company and its affairs

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in this report 
general the company is a leading educational travel company that organizes and promotes international and domestic programs for students  athletes  and professionals 
youth programs provide the opportunities for grade school  junior  and senior high school students to learn about the history  government  economy and culture of the foreign and domestic destinations they visit as well as for junior and senior high school athletes to participate in domestic and international sports challenges 
the company s professional programs emphasize meetings and seminars between participants and persons in similar professions abroad 
the company was founded in and was reincorporated in delaware in  when it was purchased and consolidated with ambassadors 
since ambassador s initial public offering in august  the company has expanded its operations primarily through internal growth and acquisitions of businesses within the travel industry 
these acquisitions included a february acquisition of certain assets of marc l 
bright and associates and a june acquisition of certain assets of travel dynamics  inc both of these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the company s results of operations since their respective dates of acquisition 
on february   the company was spun off to the stockholders of ambassadors see notes to consolidated financial statements  note 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ambassadors group  inc  and its wholly owned subsidiaries  ambassador programs  inc  ambassadors sports group  inc  ambassadors specialty group  inc  and ambassadors unlimited  llc 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements as of december   and for the period january  through february   have been carved out from the consolidated financial statements of ambassadors using the historical operating results and historical bases of the assets and liabilities of ambassadors business of which the company was comprised 
accordingly  the historical financial information presented herein does not necessarily reflect what the company s financial position  operating results and cash flows would have been had the company been a separate  stand alone entity during the periods presented see notes to consolidated financial statements  note 
the company has a single operating segment consisting of the educational travel and sports programs for students  athletes and professionals 
these programs have similar economic characteristics  offer comparable products to participants  and utilize similar processes for program marketing 
gross program receipts reflect total payments received by the company 
gross program receipts less program pass through expenses constitute the company s revenues 
program pass through expenses include all direct costs associated with the company s programs  including but not limited to  costs related to airfare  hotels  meals  ground transportation  guides  professional exchanges  and changes in currency exchange rates 
the company recognizes gross program receipts  pass through expenses and revenues upon the departure of the program 
operating expenses  which are expensed by the company as incurred  are the costs related to the creation of programs  promotional materials and marketing costs  salaries  rent  other general and administrative expenses and all of the company s ordinary expenses 
the company s policy is to obtain payment for substantially all travel services prior to entering into commitments for incurring expenses relating to such travel 
the company s businesses are seasonal 
the majority of the company s travel programs occur in june and july of each year 
the company has historically earned more than ninety percent of its annual revenues in the second and third quarters  which the company anticipates will continue for the foreseeable future 
historically  these seasonal revenues have more than offset operating losses incurred during the rest of the year 
the company s annual results would be adversely affected if the company s revenues were to be substantially below seasonal norms during these periods 
the company s operating results may fluctuate as a result of many factors  including the mix of student  sport  and professional programs  the mix of programs and program destinations offered by the company and its competitors  the introduction and acceptance of new programs and program enhancements by the company and its competitors  timing of program completions  cancellation rates  competitive conditions in the industry  marketing expenses  extreme weather conditions  international conflicts  
table of contents timing of and costs relating to acquisitions  changes in relationships with certain travel providers  economic factors  fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and other considerations affecting travel 
the substantial majority of the company s programs take place outside the united states and most foreign suppliers require payment in local currency rather than in us dollars 
accordingly  the company is exposed to foreign currency risks in certain countries as foreign currency exchange rates between those currencies and the us dollar fluctuate 
to manage these risks  the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts and forward contracts with synthetic options 
these foreign exchange contracts are entered into to support normal anticipated recurring purchases and  accordingly  are not entered into for speculative purposes 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including cash and cash equivalents  available for sale securities  intangible assets  income taxes  derivative financial instruments  and contingencies and litigation 
cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities are exposed to concentrations of credit risk 
the company places its cash and temporary cash investments with high credit quality institutions 
at times  such balances may be in excess of the federal depository insurance limit or may be on deposit at institutions which are not covered by this insurance 
if such institutions were to become insolvent during which time it held the company s cash  cash equivalents  or available for sale securities in excess of the insurance limit  it would be necessary for the company to obtain credit financing to operate its programs 
the company values its goodwill and intangible assets using fair value on the date of an acquisition 
the company periodically assesses the recoverability of the recorded goodwill 
as experienced during the fourth quarter of  impacts of international unrest  terrorism  and the resulting economic downturn can influence the recoverability of the goodwill and intangible assets carrying value 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge related to management s conclusion that the goodwill was impaired see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the impact of external influences such as terrorism combined with the effects to the company s operations could result in future inability to recover the carrying value of goodwill and certain intangible assets 
the asset and liability approach is used to account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company uses foreign currency exchange contracts as part of an overall risk management strategy 
these instruments are used as a means of mitigating exposure to foreign currency risk connected to anticipated travel programs 
in entering into these contracts  the company has assumed the risk which might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
the company does not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults 
however  if such defaults occurred  the necessity would arise to locate alternative counterparties  or the company would then consider alternate means of settling its foreign exchange contractual obligations 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

the company s policy is to expense all selling and tour promotion costs as they are incurred 
selling and tour promotion expenses decreased to million from million when comparing the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease can be directly tied to the effects of the company s marketing emphasis after the terrorist attacks of september  all marketing ceased for a time period post september  resulting in a delay of the expenses being incurred 
the company also experienced a reduction in work force during the fourth quarter of as a result of the downturn of the travel industry  which produced cost savings 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million during the comparable period in the million increase is due to a number of factors  including but not limited to professional fees and personnel costs

these foreign exchange contracts and options are entered into to support normal recurring purchases  and accordingly are not entered into for speculative purposes 
forward foreign exchange contracts are utilized to manage the risk associated with currency fluctuations on certain purchase expectations 
certain of these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and  therefore  unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts are recorded in other income expense

the decrease of million from the year ending december  to the year ending december  is primarily due to net activities with the sale or maturity and purchase of available for sale securities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease of million in cash used in the year ended december  in comparison to the comparable period in is primarily due to activities between the company and ambassadors 
during  concurrent with the spin off in february and in accordance with the terms of the master separation and distribution agreement  there was a calculation made which resulted in additional dividends approximating million being paid to ambassadors and a capital contribution to group approximating million from ambassadors 
during  the company paid a dividend of million  representing past pre tax earnings  to ambassadors 
the company has a credit facility available with a large financial institution  with a current limit of up to million for foreign currency purchases and foreign exchange forward contracts 
this facility would be drawn upon in the event the company is unable to provide payment for such foreign currency purchases and foreign exchange forward contracts upon their maturity  and it cannot be used for operational or working capital purposes 
this credit facility is renewable annually and expires in march in connection with the distribution  ambassadors agreed to provide a credit facility to the company up to million for on going operations and potential acquisition needs through august ambassadors ability to fund the credit facility could be impaired due to a variety of factors including sudden capital expenditures  fluctuations in operating results  financing activities and receivables management

under the company s cancellation policy  a program participant may be entitled to a refund of a portion of his or her deposit  less certain fees  depending on the time of cancellation 
should a greater number of participants cancel their travel in comparison to that which is part of the company s ongoing operations  due to circumstances such as international or domestic unrest  terrorism  or general economic downturn  the company s cash balances could be significantly reduced 
cash balances could also be reduced significantly if the financial institutions  which held balances beyond that federally insured  were to become insolvent 
the terrorist attacks that occurred on september   and the response by the united states had a very negative impact on domestic and international air travel and the travel industry in general 
furthermore  the threat of and a possible war with iraq has and will affect the travel industry  as well as the markets in which the company operates 
the potential and long term effects of a possible war are uncertain for the company s customers  the market for the company s common stock  the markets for the company s services  the strength of the us dollar and the us economy 
the consequences of a possible war with iraq and or geopolitical unrest are unpredictable and the company is not able to determine whether the impact will be material or highly material on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the company is continuing to pursue further acquisitions of related travel businesses that may require the use of cash and cash equivalents 
no such acquisitions are currently pending and no assurance can be given that definitive agreements for any such acquisitions will be entered into  or  if they are entered into  that they will be on terms favorable to the company 
the company used a significant amount of cash in toward its dividend payment to ambassadors prior to its spin off 
the company also received a capital contribution from ambassadors concurrent with its spin off

and agency obligations interest rate the substantial majority of the company s travel programs take place outside the united states and most foreign suppliers require payment in currency other than the us dollar 
accordingly  the company is exposed to foreign currency risk relative to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between those currencies and the us dollar 
the company has a program to provide a hedge against certain of these foreign currency risks with less than two years maturity 
the company uses forward contracts  which allow the company to acquire the foreign currency at a fixed price for a specified period of time 
some of the company s forward contracts include a synthetic component if a pre determined trigger occurs during the term of the contract 
the company is exposed to credit risk under the foreign currency contracts and options to the extent that the counterparty is unable to perform under the agreement
