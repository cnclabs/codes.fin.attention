the percentage of montana dakota s electric utility operating revenues by jurisdiction is as follows north dakota percent  montana percent  south dakota percent and wyoming percent 
system supply and system demand through an interconnected electric system  montana dakota serves markets in portions of the following states and major communities western north dakota  including bismarck  dickinson and williston  eastern montana  including glendive and miles city  and northern south dakota  including mobridge 
the interconnected system consists of seven on line electric generating stations which have an aggregate turbine nameplate rating attributable to montana dakota s interest of  kilowatts kw and a total summer net capability of  kw 
montana dakota s four principal generating stations are steam turbine generating units using coal for fuel 
the nameplate rating for montana dakota s ownership interest in these four stations including interests in the big stone station and the coyote station aggregating percent and percent  respectively is  kw 
the balance of montana dakota s interconnected system electric generating capability is supplied by three combustion turbine peaking stations 
additionally  montana dakota has contracted to purchase through october    kw of participation power annually from basin electric power cooperative for its interconnected system 
on august   montana dakota entered into an agreement with dakota i power partners dakota i to purchase energy from a megawatt wind energy farm in north dakota 
dakota i is expected to construct the project in the wind farm is in close proximity to an existing montana dakota transmission line 
the entire energy output will be dedicated to montana dakota s interconnected electric system 
regulatory approvals have been obtained from the ndpsc and sdpuc for the wind farm project 
the wind farm project is subject to certain other regulatory approvals 
montana dakota plans to construct a megawatt natural gas fired peaking unit 
the unit is scheduled to be constructed for operation by june  the project is expected to be recovered in rates

virtually all of the current fuel requirements of the coyote  heskett and lewis clark stations are met with coal supplied by westmoreland coal company westmoreland 
contracts with westmoreland for the coyote  heskett and lewis clark stations expire in may  december  and march  respectively 
montana dakota is currently in negotiations with westmoreland on the lewis clark station contract 
the majority of the big stone station s fuel requirements are currently being met with coal supplied by rag coal west  inc under contract through december  during the years ended december   through december   the average cost of coal purchased  including freight  per million british thermal units btu at montana dakota s electric generating stations including the big stone and coyote stations in the interconnected system and the average cost per ton  including freight  of the coal purchased was as follows years ended december  average cost of coal per million btu 




average cost of coal per ton the maximum electric peak demand experienced to date attributable to sales to retail customers on the interconnected system was  kw in july montana dakota s latest forecast for its interconnected system indicates that its annual peak will continue to occur during the summer and the peak demand growth rate through will approximate percent annually 
montana dakota s latest forecast indicates that its kilowatt hour kwh sales growth rate  on a normalized basis  through will approximate percent annually 
montana dakota currently estimates that  with the addition of a megawatt natural gas turbine power plant and the purchase of energy from a megawatt wind farm in north dakota  it has adequate capacity available through existing generating stations and long term firm purchase contracts until the year if additional capacity is needed in or after  it is expected to be met through intermediate term purchases 
in addition  the company and westmoreland power  inc are working with the state of north dakota to determine the feasibility of constructing a megawatt lignite fired power plant in western north dakota 
in december  the company confirmed its intent to continue the megawatt feasibility study  however the company has requested approval from the state of north dakota to also include within the study  an alternative megawatt plant option 
montana dakota has major interconnections with its neighboring utilities  all of which are mid continent area power pool mapp members 
montana dakota considers these interconnections adequate for coordinated planning  emergency assistance  exchange of capacity and energy and power supply reliability 
through a separate electric system sheridan system  montana dakota serves sheridan  wyoming and neighboring communities 
the maximum peak demand experienced to date and attributable to montana dakota sales to retail consumers on that system was approximately  kw and occurred in july the sheridan system is supplied through an interconnection with black hills power and light company under a power supply contract through december  which allows for the purchase of up to  kw of capacity annually 
regulation and competition the electric utility industry can be expected to continue to become increasingly competitive due to a variety of regulatory  economic and technological changes 
the ferc  in its order no 
 has required that utilities provide open access and comparable transmission service to third parties 
in addition  as a result of competition in electric generation  wholesale power markets have become increasingly competitive and evaluations are ongoing concerning retail competition 
montana dakota joined the midwest independent transmission system operator  inc midwest iso in september the midwest iso  which the ferc accepted as a regional transmission organization under ferc order no 
in an order issued in december  is responsible for operational control of the transmission systems of its members 
thereafter  in december  montana dakota filed an application with the ferc for authorization to transfer operational control over certain of its transmission facilities to the midwest iso  and  by order dated january   the ferc authorized the transfer 
in december  the midwest iso filed a proposed modification to the midwest iso agreement to allow montana dakota to be a separate pricing zone 
the midwest iso commenced security center operations in december and tariff administration on february the montana legislature passed an electric industry restructuring bill  effective may  the bill provided for full customer choice of electric supplier by july   stranded cost recovery and other provisions 
based on the provisions of such restructuring bill  because montana dakota operates in more than one state  the company had the option of deferring its transition to full customer choice until legislation was passed in montana on march  which delays the restructuring and transition to full customer choice until a time that montana dakota can reasonably implement customer choice in the state of its primary service territory 
in its legislative session  the north dakota legislature established an electric industry competition committee to study over a six year period the impact of competition on the generation  transmission and distribution of electric energy in north dakota 
to date  the committee has made no recommendation regarding restructuring 
in  the wypsc selected a consultant to perform a study on the impact of electric restructuring in wyoming 
the study found no material economic benefits 
no further action is pending at this time 
the sdpuc has not initiated any proceedings to date concerning retail competition or electric industry restructuring 
federal legislation addressing this issue continues to be discussed 
although montana dakota is unable to predict the outcome of such regulatory proceedings or legislation  or the extent to which retail competition may occur  montana dakota is continuing to take steps to effectively operate in an increasingly competitive environment 
for additional information regarding retail competition  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the ndpsc authorized its staff to initiate an investigation into the earnings levels of montana dakota s north dakota electric operations based on montana dakota s annual report to the ndpsc 
the investigation was based on a complaint filed with the ndpsc in september  by the ndpsc staff 
on april   the ndpsc issued an order requiring montana dakota to reduce its north dakota electric rates by million annually  effective may  on april   montana dakota filed an appeal of the ndpsc order in the north dakota south central judicial district court district court 
the filing also requested a stay of the effectiveness of the ndpsc order while the appeal was pending 
montana dakota challenged the ndpsc s determination of the level of wholesale electricity sales margins expected to be received by montana dakota 
on may   the district court granted montana dakota s request for a stay of a portion of the million annual rate reduction ordered by the ndpsc 
accordingly  montana dakota implemented an annual rate reduction of  effective with service rendered on and after may   rather than the million annual reduction ordered by the ndpsc 
the remaining million was subject to refund if montana dakota did not prevail in this proceeding 
on november   the district court issued an order reversing the decision of the ndpsc and remanded the case back to the ndpsc 
on january   the ndpsc issued an order accepting montana dakota s level of wholesale electricity sales margins thus reversing its initial decision and allowing montana dakota to continue to charge the electric rates which were in effect 
montana dakota had established reserves for revenues that had been collected subject to refund with respect to montana dakota s pending electric rate reduction 
based on the january   order  as previously discussed  the reserves were reversed and recognized in income in fuel adjustment clauses contained in north dakota and south dakota jurisdictional electric rate schedules allow montana dakota to reflect increases or decreases in fuel and purchased power costs excluding demand charges on a timely basis 
expedited rate filing procedures in wyoming allow montana dakota to timely reflect increases or decreases in fuel and purchased power costs 
in montana percent of electric revenues  such cost changes are includible in general rate filings 
environmental matters montana dakota s electric operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations providing for air  water and solid waste pollution control  state facility siting regulations  zoning and planning regulations of certain state and local authorities  federal health and safety regulations and state hazard communication standards 
montana dakota believes it is in substantial compliance with those regulations 
governmental regulations establishing environmental protection standards are continuously evolving and  therefore  the character  scope  cost and availability of the measures that will permit compliance with these laws or regulations  cannot be accurately predicted 
montana dakota did not incur any material environmental expenditures in and does not expect to incur any material capital expenditures related to environmental compliance with current laws and regulations through natural gas distribution general montana dakota sells natural gas at retail  serving over  residential  commercial and industrial customers located in communities and adjacent rural areas as of december   and provides natural gas transportation services to certain customers on its system 
great plains sells natural gas at retail  serving over  residential  commercial and industrial customers located in communities and adjacent rural areas as of december   and provides natural gas transportation services to certain customers on its system 
these services for the two public utility divisions are provided through distribution systems aggregating over  miles 
montana dakota and great plains have obtained and hold valid and existing franchises authorizing them to conduct natural gas distribution operations in all of the municipalities they serve where such franchises are required 
for additional information regarding montana dakota s and great plains franchises  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   montana dakota s and great plains net natural gas distribution plant investment approximated million 
all of montana dakota s natural gas distribution properties  with certain exceptions  are subject to the lien of the indenture of mortgage dated may   as supplemented  amended and restated  from the company to the bank of new york and douglas j 
macinnes  successor trustees 
the natural gas distribution operations of montana dakota are subject to regulation by the ndpsc  mtpsc  sdpuc and wypsc regarding retail rates  service  accounting and  in certain instances  security issuances 
the natural gas distribution operations of great plains are subject to regulation by the ndpsc and minnesota public utilities commission mpuc regarding retail rates  service  accounting and  in certain instances  security issuances 
the percentage of montana dakota s and great plains natural gas utility operating revenues by jurisdiction is as follows north dakota percent  minnesota percent  montana percent  south dakota percent and wyoming percent 
system supply  system demand and competition montana dakota and great plains serve retail natural gas markets  consisting principally of residential and firm commercial space and water heating users  in portions of the following states and major communities north dakota  including bismarck  dickinson  wahpeton  williston  minot and jamestown  western minnesota  including fergus falls  marshall and crookston  eastern montana  including billings  glendive and miles city  western and north central south dakota  including rapid city  pierre and mobridge  and northern wyoming  including sheridan 
these markets are highly seasonal and sales volumes depend on the weather 
the following table reflects this segment s natural gas sales  natural gas transportation volumes and degree days as a percentage of normal during the last five years years ended december  mdk thousands of decatherms sales residential      commercial      industrial    total      transportation commercial      industrial      total      total throughput      degree days of normal includes great plains sales and transportation volumes for great plains are for the period july through december degree days exclude great plains 
competition in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other fuels and forms of energy 
montana dakota and great plains have established various natural gas transportation service rates for their distribution businesses to retain interruptible commercial and industrial load 
certain of these services include transportation under flexible rate schedules whereby montana dakota s and great plains interruptible customers can avail themselves of the advantages of open access transportation on regional transmission pipelines  including the system of williston basin interstate pipeline company williston basin  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of wbi holdings 
these services have enhanced montana dakota s and great plains competitive posture with alternate fuels  although certain of montana dakota s customers have bypassed the respective distribution systems by directly accessing transmission pipelines located within close proximity 
these bypasses did not have a material effect on results of operations 
montana dakota and great plains acquire their system requirements directly from producers  processors and marketers 
such natural gas is supplied by a portfolio of contracts specifying market based pricing  and is transported under transportation agreements by williston basin  kinder morgan  inc  south dakota intrastate pipeline company  northern border pipeline company  viking gas transmission company and northern natural gas company to provide firm service to their customers 
montana dakota has also contracted with williston basin to provide firm storage services which enable montana dakota to meet winter peak requirements as well as allow it to better manage its natural gas costs by purchasing natural gas at more uniform daily volumes throughout the year 
demand for natural gas  which is a widely traded commodity  is sensitive to seasonal heating and industrial load requirements as well as changes in market price 
montana dakota and great plains believe that  based on regional supplies of natural gas and the pipeline transmission network currently available through its suppliers and pipeline service providers  supplies are adequate to meet its system natural gas requirements for the next five years 
regulatory matters on december   montana dakota filed an application with the sdpuc for a natural gas rate increase 
montana dakota requested a total of million annually or percent above current rates 
a final order from the sdpuc is due june  on october   great plains filed an application with the mpuc for a natural gas rate increase 
great plains requested a total of million annually or percent above current rates 
on december   the mpuc issued an order setting interim rates that approved an interim increase of million annually effective december  great plains began collecting such rates effective december   subject to refund until the mpuc issues a final order 
a final order from the mpuc is due august  on june   montana dakota filed an application with the wypsc for a natural gas rate increase 
montana dakota requested a total of  annually or percent above current rates 
on december   the wypsc approved an increase of  annually effective january  on may   montana dakota filed an application with mtpsc for a natural gas rate increase 
montana dakota requested a total of million annually or percent above current rates 
on september   the mtpsc approved an interim increase of million annually  effective with service rendered on and after september  montana dakota began collecting such rates effective september   which are subject to refund until the mtpsc issues a final order 
on november   the mtpsc approved an additional interim increase of  annually effective november  the additional interim increase is the result of a stipulation reached between montana dakota and the montana consumer counsel  the only intervener in the proceeding 
under the terms of the stipulation  the total interim relief granted million will be the final increase in the proceeding 
a hearing before the mtpsc was held on december   at which the mtpsc took under advisement the stipulation agreed upon by montana dakota and the montana consumer counsel 
a final order from the mtpsc was due on february  and is currently pending 
on april   montana dakota filed an application with the ndpsc for a natural gas rate increase 
montana dakota requested a total of million annually or percent above current rates 
on december   the ndpsc approved an increase of million annually  effective with service rendered on or after december  reserves have been provided for a portion of the revenues that have been collected subject to refund for certain of the above proceedings 
the company believes that such reserves are adequate based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the proceedings 
montana dakota s and great plains retail natural gas rate schedules contain clauses permitting monthly adjustments in rates based upon changes in natural gas commodity  transportation and storage costs 
current regulatory practices allow montana dakota and great plains to recover increases or refund decreases in such costs within a period ranging from months to months from the time such changes occur 
environmental matters montana dakota s and great plains natural gas distribution operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental  facility siting  zoning and planning laws and regulations 
montana dakota and great plains believe they are in substantial compliance with those regulations 
governmental regulations establishing environmental protection standards are continuously evolving and  therefore  the character  scope  cost and availability of the measures that will permit compliance with these laws or regulations  cannot be accurately predicted 
montana dakota and great plains did not incur any material environmental expenditures in and do not expect to incur any material capital expenditures related to environmental compliance with current laws and regulations through utility services general utility services is a diversified infrastructure company specializing in electric  gas and telecommunication utility construction  as well as industrial and commercial electrical  exterior lighting and traffic signalization 
utility services also provides related specialty equipment manufacturing  sales and rental services 
these services are provided to electric  gas and telecommunication companies along with municipal  commercial and industrial entities throughout most of the united states 
during  the company acquired utility services businesses based in california and ohio 
none of these acquisitions was individually material to the company 
construction and maintenance crews are active year round 
however  activity in certain locations may be seasonal in nature due to the effects of weather 
utility services operates a fleet of owned and leased trucks and trailers  support vehicles and specialty construction equipment  such as backhoes  excavators  trenchers  generators  boring machines and cranes 
in addition  as of december   utility services owned or leased offices in eight states 
this space is used for offices  equipment yards  warehousing  storage and vehicle shops 
at december   utility services net plant investment was approximately million 
the utility services segment backlog is comprised of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that it expects to provide under other master agreements 
the backlog at january   was approximately million compared to approximately million at january  the company expects to complete a significant amount of the backlog during the year ending december  due to the nature of its contractual arrangements  in many instances the company s customers are not committed to the specific volumes of services to be purchased under a contract  but rather the company is committed to perform these services if and to the extent requested by the customer 
the customer is  however  obligated to obtain these services from the company if they are not performed by the customer s employees 
therefore  there can be no assurance as to the customer s requirements during a particular period or that such estimates at any point in time are predictive of future revenues 
competition utility services operates in a highly competitive business environment 
most of utility services work is obtained on the basis of competitive bids or by negotiation of either cost plus or fixed price contracts 
the workforce and equipment are highly mobile  providing greater flexibility in the size and location of utility services market area 
competition is based primarily on price and reputation for quality  safety and reliability 
the size and area location of the services provided as well as the state of the economy will be factors in the number of competitors that utility services will encounter on any particular project 
utility services believes that the diversification of the services it provides  the market it serves throughout the united states and the management of its workforce will enable it to effectively operate in this competitive environment 
utilities and independent contractors represent the largest customer base 
accordingly  utility and sub contract work accounts for a significant portion of the work performed by the utility services segment and the amount of construction contracts is dependent to a certain extent on the level and timing of maintenance and construction programs undertaken by customers 
utility services relies on repeat customers and strives to maintain successful long term relationships with these customers 
environmental matters utility services operations are subject to regulation customary for the industry  including federal  state and local environmental compliance 
utility services believes it is in substantial compliance with those regulations 
governmental regulations establishing environmental protection standards are continuously evolving and  therefore  the character  scope  cost and availability of the measures that will permit compliance with these laws or regulations  cannot be accurately predicted 
utility services did not incur any material environmental expenditures in and does not expect to incur any material capital expenditures related to environmental compliance with current laws and regulations through pipeline and energy services general williston basin  the principal regulated business of wbi holdings  owns and operates approximately  miles of transmission  gathering and storage lines and owns or leases and operates compressor stations located in the states of montana  north dakota  south dakota and wyoming 
through three underground storage fields located in montana and wyoming  storage services are provided to local distribution companies  producers  natural gas marketers and others  and serve to enhance system deliverability 
williston basin s system is strategically located near five natural gas producing basins making natural gas supplies available to williston basin s transportation and storage customers and interconnects with nine pipelines allowing for the receipt and or delivery of natural gas to and from other regions of the country 
at december   williston basin s net plant investment was approximately million 
wbi holdings  through its nonregulated pipeline businesses  owns and operates gathering facilities in colorado  kansas  montana and wyoming 
these facilities include approximately  miles of field gathering lines and owned and leased compression facilities some of which interconnect with williston basin s system 
a one sixth interest in the assets of various offshore gathering pipelines and associated onshore pipeline and related processing facilities are also owned by wbi holdings 
in addition  wbi holdings provides installation sales and or leasing of alternate energy delivery systems  primarily propane air plants  as well as providing energy efficiency product sales and installation services to large end users 
wbi holdings  through its energy services businesses  provides natural gas purchase and sales services to local distribution companies  other marketers and a limited number of large end users  primarily using natural gas produced by the company s natural gas and oil production segment 
energy services transacts a significant portion of its business in the northern plains and rocky mountain regions of the united states 
in  the company sold the vast majority of its energy marketing operations 
energy services also owns a cable and pipeline magnetization and locating company as well as a manufacturer and reseller of on land  hand held locating equipment 
the cable and pipeline magnetization and locating company provides products and services which are an integral part of the ongoing reliability of the submerged cable and pipeline infrastructure 
the on land  hand held locating equipment company manufactures and resells equipment that is used for locating and identifying underground metal objects  utility systems and water distribution system leaks 
for additional information regarding these operations  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
under the natural gas act  as amended  williston basin is subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc regarding certificate  rate  service and accounting matters 
system demand and competition williston basin competes with several pipelines for its customers transportation business and at times may discount rates in an effort to retain market share 
however  the strategic location of williston basin s system near five natural gas producing basins and the availability of underground storage and gathering services provided by williston basin and affiliates along with interconnections with other pipelines serve to enhance williston basin s competitive position 
although a significant portion of williston basin s firm customers  which include montana dakota  have relatively secure residential and commercial end users  virtually all have some price sensitive end users that could switch to alternate fuels 
williston basin transports substantially all of montana dakota s natural gas utilizing firm transportation agreements  which at december   represented percent of williston basin s currently subscribed firm transportation capacity 
in october  montana dakota executed a firm transportation agreement with williston basin for a term of five years expiring in june in addition  in july  montana dakota entered into a year contract with williston basin to provide firm storage services to facilitate meeting montana dakota s winter peak requirements 
in november  williston basin filed for regulatory approval to build a mile  inch natural gas pipeline that would span sections of wyoming  montana  and north dakota 
the pipeline would transport natural gas from developing coalbed and conventional natural gas production in central wyoming and south central montana to interconnecting pipelines 
depending upon the timing of the receipt of the necessary regulatory approval  construction completion could occur in late system supply williston basin s underground storage facilities have a certificated storage capacity of approximately billion cubic feet bcf  including bcf of working gas capacity  bcf of cushion gas and bcf of native gas 
the native gas includes bcf of recoverable gas 
williston basin s storage facilities enable its customers to purchase natural gas at more uniform daily volumes throughout the year and  thus  facilitate meeting winter peak requirements 
natural gas supplies from traditional regional sources have declined during the past several years and such declines are anticipated to continue 
as a result  williston basin anticipates that a potentially significant amount of the future supply needed to meet its customers demands will come from non traditional  off system sources 
the company s coalbed natural gas assets in the powder river basin are expected to meet some of these supply needs 
for additional information regarding coalbed natural gas legal proceedings  see item legal proceedings and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
williston basin expects to facilitate the movement of these supplies by making available its transportation and storage services 
williston basin will continue to look for opportunities to increase transportation and storage services through system expansion or other pipeline interconnections or enhancements which could provide substantial future benefits 
regulatory matters and revenues subject to refund in december  williston basin filed a general natural gas rate change application with the ferc 
williston basin began collecting such rates effective june   subject to refund 
in may  the administrative law judge issued an initial decision on williston basin s natural gas rate change application 
this matter is currently pending before and subject to revision by the ferc 
reserves have been provided for a portion of the revenues that have been collected subject to refund with respect to williston basin s pending regulatory proceeding 
williston basin  in the fourth quarter of  determined that reserves it had previously established for certain regulatory proceedings  prior to the proceeding filed in  exceeded its expected refund obligation and  accordingly  reversed reserves and recognized in income million after tax 
williston basin believes that its remaining reserves are adequate based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the application filed in december environmental matters wbi holdings pipeline and energy services operations are generally subject to federal  state and local environmental  facility siting  zoning and planning laws and regulations

construction materials and mining construction materials general knife river operates construction materials and mining businesses in alaska  california  hawaii  minnesota  montana  oregon and wyoming 
these operations mine  process and sell construction aggregates crushed stone  sand and gravel and supply ready mixed concrete for use in most types of construction  including homes  schools  shopping centers  office buildings and industrial parks as well as roads  freeways and bridges 
in addition  certain operations produce and sell asphalt for various commercial and roadway applications 
although not common to all locations  other products include the sale of cement  various finished concrete products and other building materials and related construction services 
during  the company acquired several construction materials and mining businesses with operations in minnesota and montana 
none of these acquisitions was individually material to the company 
knife river s construction materials business has continued to grow since its first acquisition in knife river continues to investigate the acquisition of other construction materials properties  particularly those relating to sand and gravel aggregates and related products such as ready mixed concrete  asphalt and various finished aggregate products 
knife river s construction materials business is expected to continue to benefit from the transportation equity act for the st century tea 
tea represents an average increase in federal highway construction funding of approximately percent for the six fiscal years ending september  although it is difficult to predict the outcome of legislation regarding federal highway construction funding that is anticipated to replace tea upon its expiration  the company expects replacement funding to be comparable to tea the company believes actual passage of the reauthorization legislation may not occur until either the second or third quarter of the construction materials business had approximately million in backlog in mid february  compared to approximately million in mid february the company anticipates that a significant amount of the current backlog will be completed during the year ending december  competition knife river s construction materials products are marketed under highly competitive conditions 
since there are generally no measurable product differences in the market areas in which knife river conducts its construction materials businesses  price is the principal competitive force to which these products are subject  with service  delivery time and proximity to the customer also being significant factors 
the number and size of competitors varies in each of knife river s principal market areas and product lines 
the demand for construction materials products is significantly influenced by the cyclical nature of the construction industry in general 
in addition  construction materials activity in certain locations may be seasonal in nature due to the effects of weather 
the key economic factors affecting product demand are changes in the level of local  state and federal governmental spending  general economic conditions within the market area which influence both the commercial and private sectors  and prevailing interest rates 
knife river is not dependent on any single customer or group of customers for sales of its construction materials products  the loss of which would have a materially adverse affect on its construction materials businesses

consolidated construction materials and mining environmental matters knife river s construction materials and mining operations are subject to regulation customary for such operations  including federal  state and local environmental compliance and reclamation regulations 
except as what may be ultimately determined with regard to the issue described below  knife river believes it is in substantial compliance with those regulations 
governmental regulations establishing environmental protection standards are continuously evolving and  therefore  the character  scope  cost and availability of the measures that will permit compliance with these laws or regulations  cannot be accurately predicted 
knife river did not incur any material environmental expenditures in and except as what may be ultimately determined with regard to the issue described below  knife river does not expect to incur any material capital expenditures related to environmental compliance with current laws and regulations through in december  morse bros  inc mbi  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company  was named by the united states environmental protection agency epa as a potentially responsible party in connection with the cleanup of a commercial property site  now owned by mbi  and part of the portland  oregon  harbor superfund site 
sixty eight other parties were also named in this administrative action 
the epa wants responsible parties to share in the cleanup of sediment contamination in the williamette river 
based upon a review of the portland harbor sediment contamination evaluation by the oregon state department of environmental quality and other information available  mbi does not believe it is a responsible party 
in addition  mbi intends to seek indemnity for any and all liabilities incurred in relation to the above matters from georgia pacific west  inc  the seller of the commercial property site to mbi  pursuant to the terms of their sale agreement 
the company believes it is not probable that it will incur any material environmental remediation costs or damages in relation to the above administrative action

independent power production centennial resources and centennial international own electric generating facilities in the united states and in brazil  respectively 
electricity produced at these facilities is sold under long term contracts to nonaffiliated entities 
this segment also invests in potential new growth and synergistic opportunities that are not directly being pursued by the other business units 
substantially all of the operations of the independent power production began in domestic on november   centennial power  inc centennial power  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company  purchased megawatts of natural gas fired electric generating facilities brush plant near brush  colorado 
ninety five percent of the brush plant s output is sold to the public service of colorado  a wholly owned subsidiary of xcel energy  under two power purchase contracts that expire in october and september  respectively 
the brush plant is operated by colorado energy management under two operations and maintenance agreements that expire in october and april  respectively 
competition centennial power encounters competition in the development of new electric generating plants and the acquisition of existing generating facilities from other non utility generators  regulated utilities  nonregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities and other energy service companies as well as financial investors 
competition for power sales agreements may reduce prices in certain markets 
the movement towards deregulation in the us electric power industry has also lead to competition in the development and acquisition of domestic power producing facilities 
however  some states are reconsidering their approach to deregulation 
factors for competing in the power production industry include maintaining low production costs  having a balanced portfolio of generating assets  fuel types  customers and power sales agreements 
environmental matters the brush plant is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations providing for air  water and solid waste pollution control  state facility siting regulations  zoning and planning regulations of certain state and local authorities  federal health and safety regulations and state hazard communication standards 
centennial power believes it is in substantial compliance with those regulations 
governmental regulations establishing environmental protection standards are continuously evolving and  therefore  the character  scope  cost and availability of the measures that will permit compliance with these laws or regulations  cannot be accurately predicted 
centennial power did not incur any material environmental expenditures in and does not expect to incur any material capital expenditures related to environmental compliance with current laws and regulations through other on january   centennial power purchased a megawatt wind powered electric generation facility from san gorgonio power corporation  an affiliate of pg e national energy group  for million cash  subject to certain closing adjustments 
this facility is located in the san gorgonio pass  northwest of palm springs  california

electricity produced and sold million kwh reflects international operations for and domestic operations acquired in november the earnings from the company s equity method investment in brazil were included in other income net 
amounts presented in the preceding tables for operating revenues  purchased natural gas sold and operation and maintenance expense will not agree with the consolidated statements of income due to the elimination of intercompany transactions between the pipeline and energy services segment and the natural gas distribution  utility services  construction materials and mining  natural gas and oil production and independent power production segments 
the amounts relating to the elimination of intercompany transactions for operating revenues  purchased natural gas sold  and operation and maintenance expense are as follows million  million and million for  million  million and million for  and million  million and 
million for  respectively 
compared to electric electric earnings decreased as a result of lower average realized sales for resale prices  which were percent lower than last year  due to weaker demand in the sales for resale markets  the absence in of insurance recovery proceeds related to a outage at an electric generating station  and lower sales for resale volumes  which were percent lower than last year 
partially offsetting the earnings decline were increased retail sales volumes  which were percent higher than last year  primarily to residential  commercial and large industrial customers  decreased fuel and purchased power costs  largely lower demand charges resulting from the absence of a extended maintenance outage at an electric supplier s generating station  and increased retail sales prices  primarily demand revenue  which were partially offset by the north dakota retail rate reduction 
for further information on the north dakota retail rate reduction  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
natural gas distribution earnings at the natural gas distribution business increased as a result of higher retail sales volumes  which were percent higher than last year  largely the result of weather that was percent colder than the prior year  increased return on natural gas storage  demand and prepaid commodity balances  increased retail sales prices  largely the result of rate increases in minnesota  montana and north dakota  higher service and repair margins  and lower income taxes  largely the result of the reversal of certain tax contingency reserves 
a reserve adjustment of million after tax related to certain pipeline capacity charges partially offset the earnings increase 
the pass through of lower natural gas prices resulted in the decrease in sales revenues and purchased natural gas sold 
for further information on the retail rate increases  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
utility services utility services earnings decreased as a result of lower line construction margins in the rocky mountain region related primarily to decreased fiber optic construction work  lower construction margins in the central region due to decreased inside electrical work  the write off of certain receivables and restructuring of the engineering function of approximately million after tax  and decreased equipment sales and margins 
partially offsetting the earnings decline were increased workloads in the southwest and northwest regions  the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill in million after tax in  and decreased interest expense  primarily due to lower debt balances 
the increase in revenues and the related increase in operation and maintenance expense resulted largely from businesses acquired since the comparable period last year 
pipeline and energy services earnings at the pipeline and energy services business increased as a result of higher gathering revenues  largely increased gathering volumes  which were percent higher than last year  at higher average rates  and higher stand by fees  increased volumes transported on system and off system  at slightly higher average rates  and higher storage revenues 
also contributing to the earnings improvement were lower corporate development costs and the absence in of a write off of an investment in a software development company of  after tax 
partially offsetting the earnings increase were the net effects of the sale of certain smaller nonstrategic properties in along with higher operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  a result of the gathering system expansion to accommodate increasing natural gas volumes 
the million decrease in energy services revenue and the related decrease in purchased natural gas sold were due primarily to decreased energy marketing volumes resulting from the sale of the vast majority of the company s energy marketing operations in the third quarter of natural gas and oil production natural gas and oil production earnings decreased largely due to lower realized natural gas and oil prices  which were percent and percent lower than last year  respectively  along with lower oil production of percent  partially offset by higher natural gas production of percent  largely from operated properties in the rocky mountain area 
also adding to the earnings decline were increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense due to higher natural gas production volumes and higher rates  increased operation and maintenance expense  mainly higher lease operating expenses resulting from the expansion of coalbed natural gas production  and lower sales volumes of inventoried natural gas 
partially offsetting the earnings decline were the effects of the nonrecurring compromise agreement of million million after tax  included in operating revenues  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
hedging activities for natural gas and oil production for resulted in realized prices that were percent and percent  respectively  of what otherwise would have been received 
construction materials and mining earnings for the construction materials and mining business increased as a result of earnings from businesses acquired since the comparable period last year  higher aggregate  asphalt and cement sales volumes  increased construction revenues  largely the result of several large projects mainly in california and oregon  and lower asphalt costs 
partially offsetting the increase in earnings were the one time gain in from the sale of the company s coal operations of million million after tax  including final settlement cost adjustments  included in other income net  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  as well as earnings from four months of coal operations included in earnings 
higher selling  general and administrative costs  mainly due to higher computer support  insurance and payroll costs  and higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense due to higher sales volumes  partially offset by the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill in million after tax in  also added to the partial offset in earnings 
independent power production earnings at the independent power production segment totaled  the majority of these earnings came from the newly acquired megawatt natural gas fired electric generating facilities in colorado 
the brazilian operations also contributed to earnings 
the company s percent share of the gain of million after tax from an embedded derivative in the electric power contract and margins at the brazil facilities were largely offset by the company s percent share of the foreign currency losses of million after tax resulting from devaluation of the brazilian real and net interest expense of million after tax 
compared to electric electric earnings increased due to higher average realized sales for resale prices  decreased interest expense due to lower average borrowings  and insurance recovery proceeds related to a outage at an electric generating station 
higher operation and maintenance expense  primarily increased payroll expense and higher subcontractor costs  and increased fuel and purchased power costs  largely higher demand charge costs related to an extended maintenance outage at an electric power supplier s generating station  partially offset the earnings increase 
also partially offsetting the earnings increase were lower sales for resale volumes  and increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense resulting from higher property  plant and equipment balances 
natural gas distribution earnings at the natural gas distribution business decreased as a result of lower sales volumes  largely the result of weather in the fourth quarter which was percent warmer than a year ago  and higher operation and maintenance expenses  primarily increased payroll costs and higher bad debt expense 
lower average realized rates  return on natural gas storage  demand and prepaid commodity balances  and decreased service and repair margins also added to the earnings decline 
slightly offsetting the decline were decreased interest expense due to lower average borrowings  and earnings from a natural gas utility business acquired in july the pass through of higher natural gas prices resulted in the increase in sales revenue and purchased natural gas sold 
utility services utility services earnings increased as a result of earnings from businesses acquired since the comparable period last year  slightly higher operating margins from existing operations and decreased interest expense due to lower average interest rates 
the earnings improvement was partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative costs 
pipeline and energy services earnings at the pipeline and energy services business increased due to higher transportation and gathering volumes at higher average rates at the pipeline 
the absence in of an asset impairment recognized in in the amount of million after tax at one of the company s energy services companies and the net effect of the sale in of certain smaller nonstrategic properties at the pipeline also added to the earnings increase 
in addition  higher natural gas sales margins at energy services added to the earnings increase 
partially offsetting the earnings increase were the absence in of a million after tax reserve revenue adjustment and resulting increase to income relating to certain regulatory proceedings  prior to the proceeding filed in  and higher operation and maintenance expense 
the write off of an investment in a software development company of  after tax and expenses incurred for corporate development costs also partially offset the earnings increase 
the higher operation and maintenance expense was due primarily to increased compressor related expenses in connection with the expansion of the gathering systems 
the decrease in energy services revenue and the related decrease in purchased natural gas sold resulted from decreased energy marketing sales volumes at certain energy services operations that were sold in natural gas and oil production natural gas and oil production earnings increased largely due to higher natural gas and oil production of percent and percent since last year  respectively  combined with increased realized natural gas and oil prices  which were percent and percent higher than last year  respectively 
the higher production was largely the result of a natural gas property acquisition in april and the ongoing development of that property as well as existing properties 
also adding to the earnings increase was lower interest expense  a result of lower debt balances combined with lower average rates 
partially offsetting the earnings improvement were increased operation and maintenance expense  mainly higher lease operating expenses and higher general and administrative costs 
increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense due to higher production volumes and higher rates  and lower sales volumes of inventoried natural gas also partially offset the earnings increase 
hedging activities for natural gas and oil production for resulted in realized prices that were percent and percent  respectively  of what otherwise would have been received 
construction materials and mining earnings for the construction materials and mining business increased largely due to earnings from businesses acquired since the comparable period last year and increases at existing asphalt  aggregate  cement and ready mixed concrete construction materials operations 
also adding to the earnings increase was a one time gain from the sale of the coal operations of million million after tax  including final settlement cost adjustments  included in other income net  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  partially offset by lower coal sales volumes due primarily to four months of operations in compared to months in also partially offsetting the earnings increase were lower construction margins  largely resulting from increased competition and less available work  and the absence in of a gain of million after tax on the sale of a nonstrategic property 
increased interest expense due to higher acquisition related borrowings  higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense due to increased plant balances  and higher selling  general and administrative costs also partially offset the earnings improvement

new factors emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors  nor can it assess the effect of each such factor on the company s business or the extent to which any such factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
following are some specific factors that should be considered for a better understanding of the company s financial condition 
these factors and the other matters discussed herein are important factors that could cause actual results or outcomes for the company to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements included elsewhere in this document 
the recent events leading to the current adverse economic environment may have a general negative impact on the company s future revenues 
in response to the occurrence of several recent events  including the september   terrorist attack on the united states  the ongoing war against terrorism by the united states and the bankruptcy of several large energy and telecommunications companies  the financial markets have been disrupted 
an adverse economy could negatively affect the level of governmental expenditures on public projects and the timing of these projects that  in turn  would negatively affect the demand for the company s products and services 
innovatum  inc innovatum  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company specializing in cable and pipeline magnetization and locating  is subject to the economic conditions within the telecommunications and energy industries 
innovatum could face a future goodwill impairment if there is a continued downturn in these sectors 
at december   the goodwill amount at innovatum was approximately million 
the determination of whether an impairment will occur is dependent on a number of factors  including the level of spending in the telecommunications and energy industries  the rapid changes in technology  competitors and potential new customers 
the company s natural gas and oil production business is dependent on factors including commodity prices that cannot be predicted or controlled 
these factors include price fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices  availability of economic supplies of natural gas  drilling successes in natural gas and oil operations  the ability to contract for or to secure necessary drilling rig contracts and to retain employees to drill for and develop reserves  the ability to acquire natural gas and oil properties  and other risks incidental to the operations of natural gas and oil wells 
the company s operations are weather sensitive 
the company s results of operations can be affected by changes in the weather 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas  affect the price of energy commodities and affect the ability to perform services at the utility services and construction materials and mining businesses 
the company cannot predict future weather conditions and as a result  adverse weather conditions could negatively affect the company s operations and financial conditions 
the company is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may increase its costs of operations  impact or limit business plans  or expose the company to environmental liabilities 
the company is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations including air quality  water quality  waste management and other environmental considerations 
these laws and regulations can result in increased capital  operating  and other costs  as a result of compliance  remediation  containment and monitoring obligations  particularly with regard to laws relating to power plant emissions and coalbed natural gas development 
these laws and regulations generally require the company to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses  permits  inspections and other approvals 
both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations 
the company cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 
there are no assurances that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to the company 
revised or additional regulations  which result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions  particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from customers  could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
fidelity has been named as a defendant in several lawsuits filed in connection with its coalbed natural gas development in the powder river basin in montana and wyoming 
fidelity believes the ultimate outcome of these actions would not have a material effect on its existing coalbed natural gas operations

the company is subject to extensive government regulations that may have a negative impact on its business and its results of operations 
the company is subject to regulation by federal  state and local regulatory agencies with respect to  among other things  allowed rates of return  financings  industry rate structures  recovery of purchased power and purchased gas costs 
these governmental regulations significantly influence the company s operating environment and may affect its ability to recover costs from its customers 
the company is required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from the agencies that regulate its business 
the company believes the necessary permits  approvals and certificates have been obtained for existing operations and that the company s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws  however  the company is unable to predict the impact on operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of these agencies 
changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets 
inability to access capital may limit its ability to execute business plans  pursue improvements or make acquisitions that it may otherwise rely on for future growth 
the company relies on access to both short term borrowings  including the issuance of commercial paper  and long term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations 
if the company is not able to access capital at competitive rates  the ability to implement its business plans may be adversely affected 
market disruptions or a downgrade of its credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets 
such disruptions could include a severe economic downturn the bankruptcy of unrelated companies in the same line of business capital market conditions generally commodity prices terrorist attacks global events there are risks involved with the growth strategies of the company s independent power production business 
the operation of power generation facilities involves many risks  including start up risks  breakdown or failure of equipment  competition  inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals and inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition  construction  fuel supply or other material agreements  as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
the company s plans to construct a megawatt coal fired electric generation station in montana are pending 
the company purchased plant equipment and obtained all permits necessary to begin construction

the company s percent equity method investment in a megawatt natural gas fired electric generation project in brazil includes a power purchase agreement that contains an embedded derivative 
this embedded derivative derives its value from an annual adjustment factor that largely indexes the contract capacity payments to the us dollar 
in addition  from time to time  other derivative instruments may be utilized 
the valuation of these financial instruments  including the embedded derivative  can involve judgments  uncertainties and the use of estimates 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions could affect the reported fair value of these instruments 
these instruments could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the underlying fair values  or if a counterparty fails to perform 
competition is increasing in all of the company s businesses 
all of the company s business segments are subject to increased competition 
the independent power industry includes numerous strong and capable competitors  many of which have extensive experience in the operation  acquisition and development of power generation facilities 
utility services competition is based primarily on price and reputation for quality  safety and reliability 
the construction materials products are marketed under highly competitive conditions and are subject to such competitive forces as price  service  delivery time and proximity to the customer

critical accounting policies the company has prepared its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and these statements necessarily include some amounts that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties which affect the application of such policies 
as discussed below the company s financial position or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the company s critical accounting policies include impairment of long lived assets and intangibles the company reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable and annually for goodwill as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of the company s assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
impairment testing of natural gas and oil properties the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its natural gas and oil production activities as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the full cost method of accounting requires judgments and assumptions to be made when estimating and valuing reserves using specific point in time natural gas and oil prices 
sustained downward movements in natural gas and oil prices and changes in estimates of reserve quantities could result in a future write down of the company s natural gas and oil properties 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement between the customer and the company  when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  when the fee is fixed or determinable and when collection is probable 
the company s revenue recognition policy is discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the recognition of revenue in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue 
estimates related to the recognition of revenue include the accumulated provision for revenues subject to refund  natural gas and oil revenues and costs on construction contracts under the percentage of completion method 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
consequently  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates 
derivatives certain subsidiaries of the company have cash flow hedging instruments comprised of natural gas price swap and natural gas and oil collar agreements and a foreign currency collar agreement that has not been designated as a hedge 
the fair values of the natural gas price swap and natural gas and oil collar agreements and the foreign currency collar agreement have been recorded on the company s balance sheet 
the objective for holding the natural gas price swap and natural gas and oil collar agreements is to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and oil on the company s forecasted sale of natural gas and oil production 
the objective for holding the foreign currency collar agreement is to manage a portion of the company s foreign currency risk 
for more information on the company s derivative instruments  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
material changes to the company s results of operations could occur if the hedging instrument is not highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk or due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of the derivative instruments is based on valuations determined by the counterparties 
changes in counterparty valuation assumptions and estimates could cause a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
purchase accounting the company accounts for its acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the acquired assets and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values 
the recorded values of assets and liabilities are based on third party estimates and valuations when available 
the remaining values are based on management s judgments and estimates  and accordingly  the company s financial position or results of operations may be affected by changes in estimates and judgments 
accounting for the effects of regulation substantially all of the company s regulatory assets  other than certain deferred income taxes  are being reflected in rates charged to customers in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of regulation sfas no 

if  for any reason  the company s regulated businesses cease to meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
for all or part of their operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities relating to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be removed from the balance sheet and included in the statement of income as an extraordinary item in the period in which the discontinuance of sfas no 
occurs 
consequently  the discontinuance of sfas no 
could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates are used for items such as impairment testing of long lived assets  goodwill and natural gas and oil properties  fair values of acquired assets and liabilities under the purchase method of accounting  natural gas and oil reserves  property depreciable lives  tax provisions  uncollectible accounts  environmental and other loss contingencies  accumulated provision for revenues subject to refund  costs on construction contracts  unbilled revenues  actuarially determined benefit costs  the valuation of stock based compensation  and the fair value of an embedded derivative in a power purchase agreement related to an equity method investment in brazil as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
consequently  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates

net capital expenditures exclude the following noncash transactions related to acquisitions issuance of the company s equity securities in and and the conversion of a note receivable to purchase consideration in financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities in increased million compared to  primarily the result of the decrease of the repayment of long term debt of million and the net increase of short term borrowings of million  partially offset by the decrease in proceeds from issuance of common stock of million 
in  financing activities resulted in a decrease in cash flows of million compared to this decrease was largely due to the increase of the repayment of long term debt of million  and the decrease of the issuance of long term debt of million 
partially offsetting the decrease was an increase in proceeds from issuance of common stock of million 
defined benefit pension plans the company has qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans pension plans 
various actuarial assumptions are used in calculating the benefit expense income and liability asset related to the pension plans 
actuarial assumptions include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company within certain guidelines 
during the year ended december   the market value of plan assets was negatively affected by persistent declines in the equity markets 
at december   certain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans accumulated benefit obligations exceeded these plans assets by approximately million 
pretax pension income reflected in the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the change in pension income for the year ended december   is not expected to significantly affect earnings as a result of the impact of recent declines in the market value of pension plan assets

capital expenditures the company s capital expenditures in millions for through and as anticipated for through are summarized in the following table  which also includes the company s capital needs for the retirement of maturing long term debt and preferred stock 
actual estimated capital expenditures electric natural gas distribution utility services pipeline and energy services natural gas and oil production construction materials and mining independent power production net proceeds from sale or disposition of property 
net capital expenditures retirement of long term debt and preferred stock the estimated through capital expenditures reflected in the above table exclude potential future acquisitions other than the previously disclosed purchase of a megawatt wind powered electric generation facility 
the company continues to evaluate potential future acquisitions  however  these acquisitions are dependent upon the availability of economic opportunities and  as a result  capital expenditures may vary significantly from the above estimates 
capital expenditures for  and  related to acquisitions  in the preceding table include the following noncash transactions issuance of the company s equity securities of million in  issuance of the company s equity securities of million in  and issuance of the company s equity securities and the conversion of a note receivable to purchase consideration of million in in  the company acquired a number of businesses  none of which was individually material  including utility services companies in california and ohio  construction materials and mining businesses in minnesota and montana  an energy development company in montana and natural gas fired electric generation facilities in colorado 
the total purchase consideration for these businesses  consisting of the company s common stock and cash  was million 
the capital expenditures  including those for the previously mentioned acquisitions  and retirements of long term debt and preferred stock  were met from internal sources  the issuance of long term debt and the company s equity securities 
capital expenditures for the years through include those for system upgrades  including a megawatt natural gas fired peaking unit  as previously discussed  routine replacements  service extensions  routine equipment maintenance and replacements  land and building improvements  pipeline and gathering expansion projects  including a mile pipeline  as previously discussed  the further enhancement of natural gas and oil production and reserve growth  power generation opportunities  including the acquisition of a megawatt wind powered electric generation facility and construction of a megawatt coal fired electric generation station  both as previously discussed  and for other growth opportunities 
the company continues to evaluate potential future acquisitions and other growth opportunities  however  they are dependent upon the availability of economic opportunities and  as a result  capital expenditures may vary significantly from the estimates in the preceding table 
it is anticipated that all of the funds required for capital expenditures and retirements of long term debt and preferred stock for the years through will be met from various sources 
these sources include internally generated funds  commercial paper credit facilities at centennial and mdu resources group  inc  as described below  and through the issuance of long term debt and the company s equity securities 
capital resources certain debt instruments of the company and its subsidiaries  including those discussed below  contain restrictive covenants  all of which the company and its subsidiaries were in compliance with at december  mdu resources group  inc the company has unsecured short term bank lines of credit from several banks totaling million and a revolving credit agreement with various banks totaling million at december  the bank lines of credit provide for commitment fees at varying rates and there were no amounts outstanding under the bank lines of credit or the credit agreement at december  the bank lines of credit and the credit agreement support the company s million commercial paper program

the company intends to renew or replace the existing credit agreement  which expires december  the company s goal is to maintain acceptable credit ratings in order to access the capital markets through the issuance of commercial paper 
if the company were to experience a minor downgrade of its credit rating  it would not anticipate any change in its ability to access the capital markets 
however  in such event  the company would expect a nominal basis point increase in overall interest rates with respect to its cost of borrowings 
if the company were to experience a significant downgrade of its credit ratings  which it does not currently anticipate  it may need to borrow under its credit agreement and or bank lines of credit 
to the extent the company needs to borrow under its credit agreement and or its bank lines of credit  it would be expected to incur increased annualized interest expense on its variable rate debt of approximately  after tax based on december   variable rate borrowings

on an annual basis  the company negotiates the placement of its credit agreement and bank lines of credit that provide credit support to access the capital markets 
in the event the company was unable to successfully negotiate the credit agreement and or the bank lines of credit  or in the event the fees on such facilities became too expensive  which it does not currently anticipate  the company would seek alternative funding 
one source of alternative funding might involve the securitization of certain company assets 
in order to borrow under the company s credit agreement  the company must be in compliance with the applicable covenants and certain other conditions 
the significant covenants include maximum leverage ratios  minimum interest coverage ratio  limitation on sale of assets and limitation on investments
