outlook management believes that the near term growth in the company s macro business  especially in north america  will be under continued pressure given the current market environment for investment in capital goods 
in the company s marking and micro business management sees some positive developments from the semiconductor and electronics market 
our high power diode pumped solid state laser products  which are sold primarily in our macro business  have experienced quality issues in the past that have affected the performance of certain units in the field 
for this reason  based on available information and the company s estimation of what would be required to resolve the quality issues in the affected diode laser products  the company established a reserve of million 
in fiscal and  the company added million to this reserve  of which million was in total utilized 
in fiscal  the company utilized million of this reserve and added million to increase the reserve to million 
the company believes this reserve is adequate to address the associated costs including an estimate of the related material  labor and transportation costs estimated to be incurred related to these products that have been sold prior to september  the company also believes that future profitability will not be materially affected by this issue due to the low business volume of total sales attributable to these products in fiscal see warranty reserves 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for uncollectible customer accounts receivable based on historical experience 
additionally  an allowance is made based on an assessment of specific customers financial condition and liquidity 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
no individual customer represents more than of total accounts receivable 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  after provisions for excess and obsolete inventory salable at prices below cost 
the valuation of slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on current assessments about historical experience and future product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
these factors are impacted by market conditions  technology changes  and changes in strategic direction that are uncertain  and require estimates and management judgment 
although we strive to achieve a balance between market demands and risk of inventory excess or obsolescence  it is possible that  should conditions change  additional adjustments to inventory valuation may be needed 
warranty reserves the company provides reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties when revenue is recognized 
the company relies upon historical experience  expectation of future conditions  and its service data to estimate its warranty reserve 
the company continuously monitors these data to ensure that the reserve is sufficient 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims such costs may include material  labor and travel costs  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
while such expenses have historically been within its expectations  the company cannot guarantee this will continue in the future 
pension the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
assumptions are made about interest rates  expected investment return on plan assets  total turnover rates  and rates of future compensation increases 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates to develop our valuations 
the company generally reviews these assumptions at the beginning of each fiscal year 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions that the company may use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension benefits expense the company has recorded or may record 
the discount rate enables the company to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the company has little latitude in selecting this rate  and it must represent the market rate of high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the company considers the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets

as an effect of currency translation  net income decreased by million  or  of fiscal net income 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity at september  were cash and cash equivalents of million  an annually renewable million line of credit with deutsche bank ag and several other lines of credit to support foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies in an aggregate amount of million translated at the applicable exchange rate at september  
as of september   million was outstanding under the deutsche bank facility and million under other lines of credit 
therefore  million is unused and available under rofin s lines of credit 
there are no financial covenants which would restrict the company from drawing money under these lines of credit 
additionally  the company has outstanding short term and long term debt with a german bank  which was used to finance part of the acquisition  and to refinance the existing debt  of baasel lasertech 
at september   million was outstanding under this credit agreement 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million during fiscal approximately million in cash and cash equivalents were provided by operating activities  primarily as the result of net income and other non cash items  principally depreciation and amortization 
additionally  operating cash flows were impacted due to an increase in accrued liabilities resulting from a million down payment for a technical license agreement  offset by a decrease in accounts payable resulting from the payment made to purchase the remaining shares of cbl 
uses of cash from investing activities totaled million for the year ended september  and related primarily to various additions to property and equipment in connection with the expansion of the company s operations million partially offset by the cash of proceeds from sale of fixed assets million 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million and was primarily related to current period repayments of bank debt of million and offset by an increase in stockholders equity of million related to the issuance of additional common stock through the exercise of stock options 
management believes that the cash flow from operations  along with existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under our credit facilities and lines of credit  will provide adequate resources to meet both its capital requirements and operational needs on both a current and a long term basis in fiscal the following table illustrates the company s short and long term contractual obligations 
payments due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations   capital lease obligations operating lease obligations      purchase obligations   other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total      currency exchange rate fluctuations although the company reports its consolidated financial statements in us dollars  approximately of its sales are denominated in other currencies  primarily euro  british pound  singapore dollar  taiwanese dollar  korean won and japanese yen 
net sales and costs and related assets and liabilities are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the operations  thereby serving to reduce the company s exposure to exchange gains and losses 
exchange differences upon translation from each operation s functional currency to united states dollars are accumulated as a separate component of equity 
the currency translation adjustment component of shareholders equity had the effect of increasing total equity by million at september  and decreasing total equity by million at september  the fluctuation of the euro and the other relevant functional currencies against the us dollar has had the effect of increasing or decreasing as applicable reported net sales  as well as cost of goods sold and gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses  denominated in such foreign currencies when translated into us dollars as compared to prior periods 
the following table illustrates the effect of the changes in exchange rates on the company s fiscal  and net sales  gross profit and income from operations 
fiscal fiscal fiscal at at at exchange exchange exchange actual rates actual rates actual rates in millions net sales gross profit income from operation between fiscal and  the euro yearly average strengthened against the us dollar by approximately 
the impact of this strengthening was to increase net sales and gross profit by million and million  respectively  because approximately of sales are denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro 
however  because more than of operating expenses are also denominated in these other currencies  this same strengthening of the euro had the effect of increasing operating expenses  thereby having no impact on income from operations 
between fiscal and  the euro yearly average strengthened against the us dollar by approximately 
the impact of this strengthening was to increase net sales and gross profit by million and million  respectively  because approximately of sales are denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro 
however  because more than of operating expenses are also denominated in these other currencies  this same strengthening of the euro had the effect of increasing operating expenses and thereby decreasing income from operations by million
