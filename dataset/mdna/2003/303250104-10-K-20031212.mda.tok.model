see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of our operating segments and geographic information 
technology we specialize in analytics  software and data management technologies that analyze data and drive business processes and decision strategies 
we maintain active research in a number of fields for the purposes of deriving greater insight and predictive value from data  making various forms of data more usable and valuable to the model building process  and automating and applying analytics to the various processes involved in making high volume decisions in real time 
because of our pioneering work in credit scoring and fraud detection  we are widely recognized as the leader in predictive technology 
in all our work  we believe that our tools and processes are among the very best commercially available  and that we are uniquely able to integrate advanced analytic  software and data technologies into mission critical business solutions that offer superior returns on investment 
principal areas of expertise predictive modeling 
predictive modeling identifies and mathematically represents underlying relationships in historical data in order to explain the data and make predictions or classifications about future events 
our models summarize large quantities of data to amplify its value 
predictive models typically analyze current and historical data on individuals to produce easily understood metrics such as scores 
these scores rank order individuals by likely future performance  eg  their likelihood of making credit payments on time  or of responding to a particular offer for services 
we also include in this category models that detect the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent 
our predictive models are frequently operationalized in mission critical transactional systems and drive decisions and actions in near real time 
a number of analytic methodologies underlie our products in this area 
these include proprietary applications of both linear and non linear mathematical programming algorithms  in which one objective is optimized within a set of constraints  and advanced neural systems  which learn complex patterns from large data sets to predict the probability that a new individual will exhibit certain behaviors of business interest 
decision analysis and optimization 
decision analysis refers to the broad quantitative field that deals with modeling  analyzing and optimizing decisions made by individuals  groups and organizations 
whereas predictive models analyze multiple aspects of individual behavior to forecast future behavior  decision analysis analyzes multiple aspects of a given decision to identify the most effective action to take to reach a desired result 
we have developed an integrated approach to decision analysis that incorporates the development of a decision model that mathematically maps the entire decision structure  proprietary optimization technology that identifies the most effective strategies  given both the performance objective and constraints  the development of designed testing required for active  continuous learning  and the robust extrapolation of an optimized strategy to a wider set of scenarios than historically encountered 
this technology is behind our strategy science solutions 
transaction profiling 
transaction profiling is a patent protected technique used to extract meaningful information and reduce the complexity of transaction data used in modeling 
many of our products operate using transactional data  such as credit card purchase transactions  or other types of data that change over time 
in its raw form  this data is very difficult to use in predictive models for several reasons first  an isolated transaction contains very little information about the behavior of the individual that generated the transaction 
in addition  transaction patterns change rapidly over time 
finally  this type of data can often be highly complex 
to overcome these issues  we have developed a set of proprietary techniques that transform raw transactional data into a mathematical representation that reveals latent information  and which make the data more usable by predictive models 
this profiling technology accumulates data across multiple transactions of many types to create and update profiles of transaction patterns 
these profiles enable our neural network models to efficiently and effectively make accurate assessments of  for example  fraud risk and credit risk within real time transaction streams 

table of contents customer data integration 
decisions made on customers or prospects can benefit from data stored in multiple sources  both inside and outside the enterprise 
we have focused on developing data integration processes that are able to assemble and integrate those disparate data sources into a unified view of the customer or household  through the application of persistent keying technology 
decision management software 
in order to make a decision strategy operational  the various steps and rules need to be programmed or exported into the business software infrastructure  where it can communicate with front end  customer facing systems and back end systems such as billing systems 
we have developed software systems  sometimes known as decision engines and rules management systems  that perform the necessary functions to execute a decision strategy 
our software includes very efficient programs for these functions  facilitating  for example  user definition of extremely complex decision strategies using gui interfaces  simultaneous testing of hundreds of decision strategies in test control mode  high volume processing and analysis of transactions in real time  and integration of multiple data sources and predictive metrics for improved behavior forecasts and finer segmentation 
research and development activities our research and development expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we believe that our future success depends on our ability to continually maintain and improve our core technologies  enhance our existing products  and develop new products and technologies that meet an expanding range of markets and customer requirements 
in the development of new products and enhancements to existing products  we use our own development tools extensively 
we have traditionally relied primarily on the internal development of our products 
based on timing and cost considerations  however  we have acquired  and in the future may consider acquiring  technology or products from third parties 
in some cases  external funding eg  government grants is used to develop initial concepts 
for example  we work with the defense advanced research projects agency  or darpa  to develop advanced computational intelligence algorithms to detect patterns in genomic and medical literature data 
another long term research project is aimed at developing computer models of brain functions in order to develop more intelligent  interactive computing systems and new types of analytic algorithms 
product protection and trademarks we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our proprietary rights 
we retain the title to and protect the suite of models and software used to develop scoring models as a trade secret 
we also restrict access to our source code and limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
we have generally relied upon the laws protecting trade secrets and upon contractual non disclosure safeguards and restrictions on transferability to protect our software and proprietary interests in our product and service methodology and know how 
our confidentiality procedures include invention assignment and proprietary information agreements with our employees and independent contractors  and nondisclosure agreements with our distributors  strategic partners and customers 
we also claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation 
we have patents on many of our technologies and have patent applications pending on other technologies 
the patents we hold may not be upheld as valid and may not prevent the development of competitive products 
in addition  patents may never be issued on our pending patent applications or on any future applications that we may submit 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for competitors or users to copy or reproduce aspects of our software or to obtain information that we regard as trade secrets 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
patents and other protections for our intellectual property are important  but we believe our success and growth will depend principally on such factors as the knowledge  ability  experience and creative skills of our personnel  new products  frequent product enhancements  and name recognition 

table of contents we have developed technologies for research projects conducted under agreements with various united states government agencies or their subcontractors 
although we have acquired commercial rights to these technologies  the united states government typically retains ownership of intellectual property rights and licenses in the technologies that we develop under these contracts 
in some cases  the united states government can terminate our rights to these technologies if we fail to commercialize them on a timely basis 
in addition  under united states government contracts  the government may make the results of our research public  which could limit our competitive advantage with respect to future products based on funded research

effective october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and accordingly  ceased the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
amortization expense in fiscal totaled million as compared to amortization expense of million in fiscal the increase is attributable primarily to the incremental amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with the hnc acquisition in august  and to a lesser degree the full year of amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of assets from nykamp in december  the nine months of amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of assets from spectrum in december  the two months of amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of assets from narex in july  and the partial month of amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of assets from diversified healthcare services in september amortization expense in fiscal totaled million as compared to amortization expense of million in fiscal the increase in fiscal is attributable primarily to the incremental amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with the hnc acquisition on august   and to a lesser degree the amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of assets from nykamp in december our definite lived intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method or based on forecasted cash flows associated with the assets over periods ranging from two to fifteen years 

table of contents in process research and development during fiscal  we recorded in process research and development ipr d expense of million in connection with our acquisition of hnc 
no ipr d was recorded in connection with our fiscal acquisitions as we did not acquire any in process technology 
ipr d represents the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by purchased technologies that  as of the acquisition dates  had not yet reached technological feasibility 
the classification of the technology as complete or under development was made in accordance with the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 applicability of sfas no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
in addition  the fair value  as defined below  of the ipr d projects was determined in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we used an independent appraisal firm to assist us with our valuation of the fair value of the assets purchased from hnc 
fair value is defined as the price at which property would expect to be exchanged between a willing buyer and a willing seller  neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell  and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts 
hnc s ipr d projects consisted of projects within hnc s three legacy suites of software  consisting of the efficiency  risk and opportunity suites  as well as its development of a new software platform technology 
the current efficiency suite products under development as of the acquisition date were roamex  which replaces of the existing roamex code and adds additional capabilities  and blaze advisor  a business rules product that adds additional rules management features to this product line 
the current risk suite products under development were falcon  which will be the first project in a series to replace the legacy falcon product code base with new java and platform technology  and payment optimizer  a payment optimizer tool that incorporates new platform modeling and profiling components 
the current opportunity suite product under development was opportunity suite development osd 
osd was the core engine for this suite  and was a build out of the optimization and simulation environment ose application version unix based running on a web browser 
at the time of acquisition  hnc was also in the process of developing a new software platform technology that enables efficient deployment and installation of multiple products while significantly reducing implementation and development costs 
the ipr d projects were valued through the application of discounted cash flow analyses  taking into account many key characteristics of hnc as well as its future prospects  the rate of technological change in the industry  product life cycles  risks specific to each project  and various projects stage of completion 
stage of completion was estimated by considering the time  cost  and complexity of tasks completed prior to the acquisition  verses the project s overall expected cost  effort and risks required for achieving technological feasibility 
in the application of the discounted cash flow analyses  hnc s management provided distinct revenue forecasts for each ipr d project 
the projections were based on the expected date of market introduction  an assessment of customer needs  the expected pricing and cost structure of the related product s  product life cycles  and the importance of the existing technology relative to the in process technology 
in addition  the costs expected to complete each project were added to the operating expenses to calculate the operating income for each ipr d project 
as certain other assets contribute to the cash flow attributable to the assets being valued  returns to these other assets were calculated and deducted from the pre tax operating income to isolate the economic benefit solely attributable to each of the in process technologies 
the present value of ipr d was calculated based on discount rates recommended by the american institute of certified public accountants ipr d practice aid  which depend on the stage of completion and the additional risk associated with the completion of each of the ipr d projects 
as a recommended basis for the valuation of technology under development  we considered venture capital rates of return as an appropriate measure of the discount rates associated with each ipr d project 
as a result  the earnings associated with the incomplete technology were discounted at a rate ranging from to

interest expense on august   we issued million of senior convertible notes the senior notes that mature in august interest expense on the senior notes recorded by us  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million during fiscal as a result of the hnc acquisition and subsequent merger of the hnc entity into fair isaac  we became the issuer of million in convertible subordinated notes the subordinated notes due in september the subordinated notes were recorded at their fair value of million on the acquisition date  as determined based on their quoted market price  which resulted in our recognition of a million note discount

the increase in analytic software tools segment operating income was due primarily to an increase in higher margin blaze decision system and blaze advisor revenues in fiscal  the latter of which resulted from the hnc acquisition 
the decrease in the professional services segment operating income resulted primarily from the acquisitions of nykamp and hnc  which contributed to lower professional services margins in fiscal  offset by the increase in professional service revenue contributions from these acquisitions 
stock based compensation we have stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we measure compensation expense for our employee 
table of contents stock based compensation awards using the intrinsic value method and provide pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if a fair value method had been applied 
therefore  compensation cost for employee stock awards is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of our common stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock and is amortized over the related service periods using the straight line method 
compensation expense previously recorded for unvested employee stock based compensation awards that are forfeited upon employee termination is reversed in the period of forfeiture 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
this expense is recorded in cost of revenues  research and development  and selling  general and administrative expense

the senior notes become convertible into shares of fair isaac common stock  subject to the conditions described below  at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustments for certain events 
the initial conversion price is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately shares of fair isaac common stock per  principal amount of the senior notes 
holders may surrender their senior notes for conversion  if any of the following conditions is satisfied i prior to august   during any fiscal quarter  if the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is more than of the conversion price per share of our common stock on the corresponding trading day  ii at any time after the closing sale price of our common stock on any date after august  is more than of the then current conversion price  iii during the consecutive business day period following any consecutive trading day period in which the average trading price of a senior note was less than of the average sale price of our common stock during such trading day period multiplied by the applicable conversion rate  subject to certain limitations  iv if we have called the senior notes for redemption  or v if we make certain distributions to holders of our common stock or we enter into specified corporate transactions 

table of contents the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of fair isaac and rank equal in right of payment with all of our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the senior notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness and existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the senior notes bear regular interest at an annual rate of  payable on august and february of each year  beginning february  through august  beginning august   regular interest will accrue at the rate of  and be due and payable upon the earlier to occur of redemption  repurchase  or final maturity 
in addition  the senior notes bear contingent interest during any six month period from august to february and from february to august  commencing with the six month period beginning august   if the average trading price of the senior notes for the five trading day period immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals or more of the sum of the principal amount of  plus accrued and unpaid regular interest on  the senior notes 
the amount of contingent interest payable on the senior notes in respect of any six month period will equal per annum of the average trading price of the senior notes for the five trading day period immediately preceding such six month period 
we may redeem for cash all or part of the senior notes on and after august   at a price equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their senior notes on august   august   august  and august   or upon a change in control  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes being repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we are the issuer of million of the subordinated notes 
the subordinated notes are convertible into shares of fair isaac common stock at a conversion rate of approximately shares of fair isaac common stock per  principal amount of the subordinated notes  subject to anti dilution adjustment 
the subordinated notes are general unsecured obligations of fair isaac and are subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of fair isaac 
interest on the subordinated notes is payable on march and september of each year until maturity 
we may redeem the subordinated notes on or after september   or earlier if the price of fair isaac common stock reaches certain levels 
if we redeem the subordinated notes prior to september   we will also be required to pay a redemption premium as prescribed by the indenture 
we are party to a credit agreement with a financial institution that provides for a million revolving line of credit through february under the agreement we are required to comply with various financial covenants  which include but are not limited to  minimum levels of domestic liquidity  parameters for treasury stock repurchases  dividend payments  and merger and acquisition requirements 
at our option  borrowings under this agreement bear interest at the rate of libor plus or at the financial institution s prime rate  payable monthly 
the agreement also includes a letter of credit subfeature that allows us to issue commercial and standby letters of credit up to a maximum amount of million and a foreign exchange facility that allows us to enter contracts with the financial institution to purchase and sell certain currencies  subject to a maximum aggregate amount of million and other specified limits 
as of september   no borrowings were outstanding under this agreement and we were in compliance with all related covenants 
as of september   this credit facility also served to collateralize certain letters of credit aggregating million  issued by us in the normal course of business 
as of september   this credit facility also served to collateralize contracts to sell certain currencies aggregating million  entered into by us pursuant to our hedging program to manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk on existing foreign currency receivable and bank balances 
available borrowings under this credit agreement are reduced by the principal amount of letters of credit and by of the aggregate amount of contracts to purchase and sell certain foreign currencies outstanding under the facility 
as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable security investments 
we believe that these balances  including interest to be earned thereon  and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working and other capital requirements over the course of the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
in the normal course of business  we evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses  or establishing strategic relationships with or investing in these businesses 
we may elect to use available cash and cash equivalents and marketable security 
table of contents investments to fund such activities in the future 
in the event additional needs for cash arise  we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all  particularly in light of the current decline in the capital markets 
if adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or respond to competitive pressures could be limited 
we are a limited partner in azure venture partners i  lp azure  a venture capital investment management fund  and are committed to invest an additional million into this fund 
the ultimate timing of this additional investment will be dependent on when the fund managers make additional capital calls 
the most recent capital call required us to invest an additional million into this fund in may it is possible that additional capital calls may require us to invest some or all of our remaining commitment during fiscal the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of september  thereafter total in thousands senior notes subordinated notes operating lease obligations mainframe service agreement azure cost method investment capital call total commitments million represents the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes

million represents the aggregate principal amount of the subordinated notes 
refer to note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding the subordinated notes 
we are committed to invest an additional million into the azure fund 
the ultimate timing of this additional investment will be dependent on when the fund managers make additional capital calls 
it is possible that additional capital calls may require us to invest some or all of our remaining commitment during fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources that are material to investors 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require management to make certain judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions  capitalized software development costs  internal use software  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form 
table of contents the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition software license fee revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred at our customer s location  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the normal pricing practices for those products and services when sold separately by us and customer renewal rates for post contract customer support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
when software licenses are sold together with implementation or consulting services  license fees are recognized upon delivery provided that the above criteria are met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the services do not provide significant customization or modification of the software products and are not essential to the functionality of the software that was delivered 
for arrangements with services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and related service revenues are recognized using contract accounting as described below 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes due 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not probable  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
if an arrangement provides allows for customer acceptance  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
revenues from post contract customer support services  such as software maintenance  are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the support period 
the majority of our software maintenance agreements provide technical support as well as unspecified software product upgrades and releases when and if made available by us during the term of the support period 
revenues recognized from our credit scoring  data processing  data management and internet delivery services are recognized as these services are performed  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
transactional based license fees under software license arrangements  network service and internally hosted software agreements are recognized as revenue based on system usage or when fees based on system usage exceed monthly minimum license fees  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we provide consulting  training  model development and software integration services under both hourly based time and materials and fixed priced contracts 
revenues from these services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
for fixed price service contracts  we apply the percentage of completion method of contract accounting to determine progress towards completion 
in such instances  management is required to estimate the input measures  generally based on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours of the project  with consideration also given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
adjustments to estimates are made in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known and  accordingly  recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
estimated losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss 
if substantive uncertainty related to customer acceptance of services 
table of contents exists  we apply the completed contract method of accounting and defer the associated revenue until the contract is completed 
revenue determined by the percentage of completion method in excess of contract billings is recorded as an unbilled receivable 
such amounts are generally billable upon reaching certain performance milestones as defined by individual contracts 
billings collected in advance of performance and recognition of revenue under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue 
in certain of our non software arrangements  we enter into contracts that include the delivery of a combination of two or more of our service offerings 
typically  such multiple element arrangements incorporate the design and development of data management tools or systems and an ongoing obligation to manage  host or otherwise run solutions for our customer 
such arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting provided that the delivered item has stand alone value and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the total arrangement fee is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their fair values and to the initial delivered elements using the residual method 
revenue is recognized separately  and in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  for each element 
we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we closely analyze specific accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment cycles 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
business acquisitions  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  and in certain cases one time charges associated with the write off of in process research and development  which affect the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expense 
the determination of the value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires management to make various estimates and assumptions 
estimates using different  but each reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results 
we continually review the events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment for factors that would provide evidence of the impairment of goodwill 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on october   and as a result have ceased amortization of goodwill 
as required by sfas no 
 we have determined that our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments 
in addition  we were required to assess whether goodwill within our reporting units was impaired at the date of the adoption of this statement using a two step transitional impairment test 
we completed the first step during fiscal  and determined that goodwill was not impaired on october  accordingly  we were not required to complete the second step of the impairment test 
we selected the fourth quarter to perform our annual goodwill impairment test  and determined that goodwill was not impaired as of july  there are various assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss  and estimates using different  but each reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results 
therefore  the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future  if any  may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized were appropriate based on the information available to management 

table of contents capitalized software development costs we capitalize certain software development costs after establishment of a product s technological feasibility 
such costs are then amortized over the estimated life of the related product 
periodically  we compare a product s unamortized capitalized cost to the product s estimated net realizable value 
to the extent unamortized capitalized costs exceed net realizable value based on the product s estimated future gross revenues  reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of the product  the excess is written off 
this analysis requires us to estimate future gross revenues associated with certain products  and the future costs of completing and disposing of certain products 
if these estimates change  write offs of capitalized software costs could result 
internal use software costs incurred to develop internal use software during the application development stage are capitalized and reported at the lower of cost or fair value 
application development stage costs generally include costs associated with internal use software configuration  coding  installation and testing 
costs of significant upgrades and enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized whereas costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades and enhancements are expensed as incurred 
we assess potential impairment of capitalized internal use software whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net cash flows that are expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
this methodology recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we determine during any period that we could realize a larger net deferred tax asset than the recorded amount  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to increase income for the period 
conversely  if we determine that we would be unable to realize a portion of our recorded deferred tax asset  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to record a charge to income for the period 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to various proceedings  lawsuits and claims relating to product  technology  labor  shareholder and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
the amount of loss accrual  if any  is determined after analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted by new developments or revised strategies 
risk factors risks related to our business we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of products and services  and our revenue will decline if the market does not continue to accept these products and services 
we expect that revenues from some or all of our falcon fraud manager  decision manager for medical bill review  outsourced bill review and account management products and services  and our agreements with transunion  equifax and experian  will account for a substantial portion of our total revenues for the 
table of contents foreseeable future 
our revenues will decline if the market does not continue to accept these products and services 
factors that might affect the market acceptance of these products and services include the following changes in the business analytics industry  technological change  our inability to obtain or use state fee schedule or claims data in our insurance products  saturation of market demand  loss of key customers  industry consolidation  inability to successfully sell our products in new vertical markets  and events that reduce the effectiveness of or need for fraud detection capabilities 
we rely on relatively few customers  as well as our contracts with the three major credit reporting agencies  for a significant portion of our business  and our future revenues and operating income could decline if the terms of these relationships change 
most of our customers are relatively large enterprises  such as banks  insurance companies  healthcare firms  retailers and telecommunications carriers 
as a result  many of our customers and potential customers are significantly larger than we are and may have sufficient bargaining power to demand reduced prices and favorable nonstandard terms 
we also derive a substantial portion of our revenues and operating income from contracts with the three major credit reporting agencies  transunion  equifax and experian 
these contracts accounted for of our revenues in fiscal the loss of any major customer  the loss of a relationship with one of the major credit reporting agencies or the delay of significant revenue from these customers or credit reporting agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
defects  failures and delays associated with our introduction of new products could seriously harm our business 
significant undetected errors or delays in new products or new versions of products may affect market acceptance of our products and could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in the past  we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new products and product enhancements  primarily due to difficulties developing models  acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments 
we have also experienced errors or bugs in our software products  despite testing prior to release of the products 
software errors in our products could affect the ability of our products to work with other hardware or software products  could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
errors or defects in our products that are significant  or are perceived to be significant  could result in the rejection of our products  damage to our reputation  lost revenues  diverted development resources  potential product liability claims and increased service and support costs and warranty claims 
our future revenues may be uncertain because of reliance on third parties for marketing and distribution 
our scoring solutions segment and strategy machine solutions segment rely on distributors  including with respect to our scoring solutions segment  transunion  equifax and experian  and we intend to continue to market and distribute our products through existing and future distributor relationships 
failure by our existing and future distributors to generate significant revenues or our failure to establish additional distribution or sales and marketing alliances could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  distributors may become our competitors with respect to the products they distribute either by developing a competitive product themselves or by distributing a competitive 
table of contents offering 
for example  credit reporting agencies may evaluate and seek to distribute or acquire alternative vendors prepaid products that compete with our products 
competition from existing and future distributors or other sales and marketing partners could significantly harm sales of our products 
our share price will fluctuate as a result of several factors  including changes in our revenues and operating results 
the market price of our common shares may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations due to a number of factors  including variations in our revenues and operating results 
with respect to our revenues and operating results  we believe that you should not rely on period to period comparisons of financial results as an indication of future performance 
most of our operating expenses will not be affected by short term fluctuations in revenues  thus  short term fluctuations in revenues may significantly impact operating results 
additional factors that will cause our share price to fluctuate include the following variability in demand from our existing customers  failure to meet the expectations of market analysts  changes in recommendations by market analysts  the lengthy and variable sales cycle of many products  combined with the relatively large size of orders for our products  increase the likelihood of short term fluctuation in revenues  consumer dissatisfaction with  or problems caused by  the performance of our products  the timing of new product announcements and introductions in comparison with our competitors  the level of our operating expenses  changes in competitive conditions in the consumer credit  financial services and insurance industries  fluctuations in domestic and international economic conditions  our ability to complete large installations on schedule and within budget  acquisition related expenses and charges  and timing of orders for and deliveries of software systems 
in addition  the financial markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies  and these fluctuations sometimes have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market fluctuations  as well as industry specific and general economic conditions may adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
we may not be able to forecast our revenues accurately because our products have a long and variable sales cycle 
we cannot forecast our revenues accurately because the length of our sales cycles makes it difficult for us to predict the quarter in which sales to expected customers will occur 
the long sales cycle for our products may cause license revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
the sales cycle to license our products can typically range from days to months 
customers are often cautious in making decisions to acquire our products  because purchasing our products typically involves a significant commitment of capital  and may involve shifts by the customer to a new software and or hardware platform or changes in the customer s operational procedures 
delays in completing sales can arise while customers complete their internal procedures to approve large capital expenditures and test and accept our applications 
consequently  we face difficulty predicting the quarter in which sales to expected customers will occur 
this has contributed  and we expect it to continue to contribute  to fluctuations in our operating results 

table of contents we typically have back ended quarters 
significant portions of our quarterly software licensing agreements are concluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter  generally with a concentration of such revenues earned in the final week of that month 
prior to the very end of any quarter  we must rely on our forecasts of revenue for planning  modeling and other purposes 
however  forecasts are only estimates and may not correlate to revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
consequently  a significant discrepancy between actual results and sales forecasts could cause us to improperly plan or budget and thereby adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
any publicly stated revenue or earnings projections by us are especially subject to this risk 
any failure to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel could hinder our ability to successfully manage our business 
our future success will likely depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain experienced sales  research and development  marketing  technical support and management personnel 
the complexity of our products requires highly trained customer service and technical support personnel to assist customers with product installation and deployment 
the labor market for these persons is very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding 
we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel  especially technical and sales personnel  and we may need additional staff to support new customers and or increased customer needs 
we may also recruit and employ skilled technical professionals from other countries to work in the united states 
limitations imposed by federal immigration laws and the availability of visas could hinder our ability to attract necessary qualified personnel and harm our business and future operating results 
there is a risk that even if we invest significant resources in attempting to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  we will not succeed in our efforts  and our business could be harmed 
failure or inability to obtain data from our customers or others could harm our business 
we must develop or obtain a reliable source of sufficient amounts of current and statistically relevant data to analyze transactions and update our products  including our consumer credit  financial services  predictive modeling  decision analysis  intelligence management  credit card fraud control and profitability management  loan underwriting and insurance products 
in most cases  these data must be periodically updated and refreshed to enable our products to continue to work effectively in a changing environment 
we do not own or control much of the data that we require  most of which is collected privately and maintained in proprietary databases 
customers and key business alliances agree to provide us the data we require to analyze transactions  report results and build new models 
if we fail to maintain good relationships with our customers and business alliances  or if they decline to provide such data due to legal privacy concerns  competition concerns  prohibitions or a lack of permission from their customers  we could lose access to required data and our products might become less effective 
in addition  our decision manager for medical bill review products uses data from state workers compensation fee schedules adopted by state regulatory agencies 
third parties have previously asserted copyright interests in these data  and these assertions  if successful  could prevent us from using these data 
any interruption of our supply of data could seriously harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may incur risks related to acquisitions or significant investment in businesses 
we have made in the past  and may make in the future  acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies 
any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses  which include the possibility that we will pay more than the acquired companies or assets are worth  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  the potential product liability associated with the sale of the acquired companies products  
table of contents the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the potential dilution of our existing stockholders and earnings per share  unanticipated liabilities  legal risks and costs  the distraction of management from our ongoing business  and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel 
these factors could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations  particularly in the event of a significant acquisition 
we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights  and if we are unable to protect them  our business could be harmed 
our success will depend  in part  upon our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights 
to date  we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright  patent  trade secret  and trademark laws  and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology 
this protection of our proprietary technology is limited  and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent 
in addition  patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications  and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products 
any disclosure  loss  invalidity of  or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position  and ultimately  our business 
we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate or that others  including our competitors  will not use our proprietary technology without our consent 
furthermore  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  some of our technologies were developed under research projects conducted under agreements with various united states government agencies or subcontractors 
although we have commercial rights to these technologies  the united states government typically retains ownership of intellectual property rights and licenses in the technologies developed by us under these contracts  and in some cases can terminate our rights in these technologies if we fail to commercialize them on a timely basis 
under these contracts with the united states government  the results of research may be made public by the government  limiting our competitive advantage with respect to future products based on our research 
we may be subject to possible infringement claims that could harm our business 
with recent developments in the law that permit patenting of business methods  we expect that products in the industry segments in which we compete  including software products  will increasingly be subject to claims of patent infringement as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products overlaps 
we may need to defend claims that our products infringe patent  copyright or other rights  and as a result may incur significant defense costs or substantial damages  be required to cease the use or sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop or license a substitute non infringing technology  discontinue the use of some technology  or be required to obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement  which license may not be available or might require substantial royalties or license fees that would reduce our margins 

table of contents security is important to our business  and breaches of security  or the perception that e commerce is not secure  could harm our business 
our business requires the appropriate and secure utilization of consumer and other sensitive information 
internet based  electronic commerce requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks and several of our products are accessed through the internet  including our consumer services accessible through the www 
myfico 
com website 
security breaches in connection with the delivery of our products and services  including products and services utilizing the internet  or well publicized security breaches affecting the internet in general  could significantly harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we cannot be certain that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our netsourced products  consumer services and proprietary database information 
protection from system interruptions is important to our business  and a sustained interruption of our telecommunication systems could harm our business 
system interruptions could delay and disrupt our products and services  cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers 
these interruptions include fires  floods  earthquakes  power losses  telecommunication failures and other events beyond our control 
it is particularly important for us to protect our data centers against damage from these events 
the on line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunication providers  and we believe we have taken reasonable precautions to protect our data centers or any failure of our telecommunications links from events that could interrupt our operations 
any sustained system interruption could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our customers requirements  which could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to our industry our ability to increase our revenues will depend to some extent upon introducing new products and services  and if the marketplace does not accept these new products and services  our revenues may decline 
we have a significant share of the available market in our scoring segment and for certain services in our strategy machine solutions segment specifically  the markets for account management services at credit card processors and credit card fraud detection software 
to increase our revenues  we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we believe much of our future growth prospects will rest on our ability to continue to expand into newer markets for our products and services  such as direct marketing  insurance  small business lending  retail  telecommunications  personal credit management  the design of business strategies using strategy science technology and internet services 
these areas are relatively new to our product development and sales and marketing personnel 
products that we plan to market in the future are in various stages of development 
we cannot assure you that the marketplace will accept these products 
if our current or potential customers are not willing to switch to or adopt our new products and services  our revenues will decrease 
if we fail to keep up with rapidly changing technologies  our products could become less competitive or obsolete 
in our markets  technology changes rapidly  and there are continuous improvements in computer hardware  network operating systems  programming tools  programming languages  operating systems  database technology and the use of the internet 
if we fail to enhance our current products and develop new products in response to changes in technology or industry standards  our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete 
for example  the rapid growth of the internet environment creates new opportunities  risks and uncertainties for businesses  such as ours  which develop software that must also be designed to 
table of contents operate in internet  intranet and other online environments 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to internally develop new and competitive technologies  use leading third party technologies effectively  continue to develop our technical expertise  anticipate and effectively respond to changing customer needs  initiate new product introductions in a way that minimizes the impact of customers delaying purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product releases  and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
new product introductions and pricing strategies by our competitors could decrease our product sales and market share  or could pressure us to reduce our product prices in a manner that reduces our margins 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors  and this inability could impair our capacity to sell our products 
the market for business analytics is new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and we expect competition in this market to persist and intensify 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope of the products and services they offer  and include in house analytics departments  credit reporting agencies  computer service providers  regional risk management  marketing  systems integration and data warehousing competitors  application software companies  including enterprise software vendors  management information system departments of our customers and potential customers  including financial institutions  insurance companies and telecommunications carriers  third party professional services and consulting organizations  internet companies  hardware suppliers that bundle or develop complementary software  network and telecommunications switch manufacturers  and service providers that seek to enhance their value added services  neural network tool suppliers  and managed care organizations 
we expect to experience additional competition from other established and emerging companies  as well as from other technologies 
for example  our falcon fraud manager and falcon fraud manager for merchants products compete against other methods of preventing credit card fraud  such as credit cards that contain the cardholder s photograph  smart cards  cardholder verification and authentication solutions and other card authorization techniques 
many of our anticipated competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing  professional services and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources than we can to develop  promote and sell their products 
many of these companies have extensive customer relationships  including relationships with many of our current and potential customers 
furthermore  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
if we are unable to respond as quickly or effectively to changes in customer requirements as our competition  our ability to expand our business and sell our products will be negatively affected 

table of contents our competitors may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices individually or as part of integrated suites of several related products 
this ability may cause our customers to purchase products of our competitors that directly compete with our products 
price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our margins  and could also harm our ability to obtain new long term contracts and renewals of existing long term contracts on favorable terms 
government regulations that apply to us or to our customers may expose us to liability  or render our products obsolete 
legislation and governmental regulation affects how our business is conducted and  in some cases  subject us to the possibility of future lawsuits arising from our products and services 
legislation and governmental regulation also influence our current and prospective customers activities  as well as their expectations and needs in relation to our products and services 
both our core businesses and our newer consumer initiatives are affected by regulation  including the following significant regulatory areas federal and state regulation of consumer report data and consumer reporting agencies  such as the fair credit reporting act  or fcra  regulation designed to insure that lending practices are fair and non discriminatory  such as the equal credit opportunity act  or ecoa  privacy law  including but not limited to the provisions of the financial services modernization act of  or fsma  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  regulations governing the extension of credit to consumers and by regulation e under the electronic fund transfers act  as well as non governmental visa and mastercard electronic payment standards  fannie mae and freddie mac regulations  among others  for our mortgage services products  insurance regulations related to our insurance products  consumer protection laws  such as federal and state statutes governing the use of the internet and telemarketing  and regulations of foreign jurisdictions on our international operations  including the european union s privacy directive 
in making credit evaluations of consumers  performing fraud screening or user authentication  our customers are subject to requirements of federal law  including the fcra and the ecoa  and regulations thereunder  as well as state laws which impose a variety of additional requirements 
privacy legislation such as the fsma may also affect the nature and extent of the products or services that we can provide to customers as well as our ability to collect  monitor and disseminate information subject to privacy protection 
in addition to existing regulation  changes in legislative  judicial  regulatory or consumer environments could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
for example  the national uniformity provisions of the fcra are set to expire in which could lead to greater state regulation and additional costs to our business 
state regulation could cause financial institutions to pursue new strategies  reducing the demand for our products 
in addition  legislative reforms of workers compensation laws that aim to simplify this area of regulation and curb abuses could diminish the need for  and the benefits provided by  our decision manager for medical bill review products and outsourced bill review services 
since our revenues depend  to a great extent  upon conditions in the consumer credit  financial services and insurance industries  an industry specific downturn may harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
during fiscal  of our revenues were derived from sales of products and services to the consumer credit  financial services and insurance industries 
a downturn in the consumer credit  the financial services or the insurance industry  including a downturn caused by increases in interest rates or a tightening of credit  
table of contents among other factors  could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
since  while the rate of account growth in the us bankcard industry has been slowing and many of our large institutional customers have merged and consolidated  we have generated most of our revenue growth from our bankcard related scoring and account management businesses by selling and cross selling our products and services to large banks and other credit issuers 
as this industry continues to consolidate  we may have fewer opportunities for revenue growth due to changing demand for our products and services that support customer acquisition programs of our customers 
in addition  industry consolidation could affect the base of recurring revenues derived from contracts in which we are paid on a per transaction basis if consolidated customers combine their operations under one contract 
we cannot assure you that we will be able effectively to promote future revenue growth in our businesses 
risk related to external conditions general economic conditions and world events could continue to result in a reduced demand for our products and services 
due to the economic slowdown in the united states and in europe in recent years  companies in many industries are delaying or reducing technology purchases 
this softening of demand for our decisioning solutions or other products and services results in reductions in capital expenditures by our customers  longer sales cycles  deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our products and increased price competition 
as a result  if the current economic conditions in the us and europe continue or worsen  if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs  or if there is an escalation in regional or continued global conflicts  we may fall short of our revenue expectations for the first quarter of fiscal or for the entire year 
our operations outside the united states subject us to unique risks that may harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a growing portion of our revenues is derived from international sales 
during fiscal  of our revenues were derived from business outside the united states 
as part of our growth strategy  we plan to continue to pursue opportunities outside the united states 
accordingly  our future operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors arising out of international commerce  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the general economic and political conditions in countries where we sell our products and services  difficulty in staffing our operations in various countries  the effects of a variety of foreign laws and regulations  including restrictions on access to personal information  import and export licensing requirements  longer payment cycles  potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights  currency fluctuations  changes in tariffs and other trade barriers  and difficulties and delays in translating products and related documentation into foreign languages 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address each of these challenges in the near term 
additionally  some of our business will be conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are not currently material to our cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
however  an increase in our foreign revenues could subject us to increased foreign currency transaction risks in the future 

table of contents we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of fair isaac or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 
certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  could make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us difficult  even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders 
these provisions include adoption of a rights agreement  commonly known as a poison pill  and giving our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these factors and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock 
if requirements relating to accounting treatment for employee stock options are changed  we may be forced to change our business practices 
we have not decided to expense stock options despite the recent debate regarding the accounting treatment of stock options 
if we elected or were required to record an expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation instead of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  we could have significant accounting charges 
if future laws or regulations require us to treat all stock based compensation as an expense using the fair value method  we may avoid any accounting charges by reducing the number of stock options granted to employees or by granting options to fewer employees 
this could affect our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates  and increase the cash compensation we would have to pay to them 
alternatively  if we continue to issue stock options at the same level  operating expenses could rise  negatively affecting our results of operations 
changes in tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that our equity risks are not material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of income securities with an average maturity of three years or less 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if

we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio

to the extent that general market interest rates fluctuate  the fair value of the notes may increase or decrease 
forward foreign currency contracts we maintain a hedging program to manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk on existing foreign currency receivable and bank balances by entering into forward contracts to sell or buy foreign currency 
at period end  foreign denominated receivables and cash balances held by our us reporting entities are remeasured into the us dollar functional currency at current market rates 
the change in value from this remeasurement is then reported as a foreign exchange gain or loss for that period in our accompanying consolidated statements of income and the resulting gain or loss on the forward contract mitigates the exchange rate risk of the associated assets 
all of our forward foreign currency contracts have maturity periods of less than three months 
such derivative financial instruments are subject to market risk
