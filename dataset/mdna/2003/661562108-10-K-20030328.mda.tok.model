these forward looking statements represent our present expectations or beliefs concerning future events 
we caution that such statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
thus  results actually achieved may differ materially from expected results included in these statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  included in this annual report 
results of operations vs 
net earnings for were  or 
per share  compared to net earnings of  or 
per share  for these fluctuations were attributable to the following factors operating revenues total operating revenues increased  or  during this increase was primarily the result of increases in local network services revenues of   long distance and access services revenues of  and other operating revenues of   offset partially by a decrease in directory advertising  billing and other services revenues of and a minimal decrease in telecommunication equipment sales of 
increases in local network services revenues of  or  were attributable to several factors  one of which was north pittsburgh s chapter filing with the pa puc  which became effective in december of as a result of this revenue neutral filing  north pittsburgh increased local rates  with the corresponding offset occurring through a decrease in intrastate access rates 
the revenue shift from long distance and access services revenues to local network services revenues was approximately  for penn telecom s local dial tone and vertical features revenues also increased by  due to continued successful penetration south of north pittsburgh s territory in the city of pittsburgh and surrounding areas as well as north of north pittsburgh s territory in the city of butler and its surrounding areas 
penn telecom s access lines installed increased from  as of december  to  as of december  in addition  revenues at penn telecom for pri circuits grew approximately as circuits increased from as of december  to as of december  the increase in long distance and access services revenues of  or  was attributable to an increase in high capacity circuits sold special access revenues  offset partially by a decrease in access revenues and a decrease in toll revenues 
special access revenues increased at north pittsburgh and  at penn telecom  mostly as a result of large increases in the number of ds and ds circuits sold 
at penn telecom  the number of ds s  ds s and oc s installed have increased from  and  respectively  as of december   to  and  respectively  as of december  access revenues decreased approximately  mostly as a result of the north pittsburgh chapter filing which  as previously described  shifted approximately  from intrastate access revenues to local network services revenues 
in addition  at north pittsburgh  intrastate access minutes of use mous have been declining  mostly as a result of wireless substitution 
these decreases at north pittsburgh were partially offset by the growth in access revenues at penn telecom as the number of penn telecom lines in service nearly doubled 
overall toll 
table of contents revenues decreased due to a decrease in intralata toll revenues at north pittsburgh  partially offset by a growth in both intralata and interlata toll revenues at penn telecom 
the decrease in intralata toll revenues at north pittsburgh was mostly a result of a decrease in market share and loss of mous to such competition as wireless and alternative communication technologies such as e mail 
in addition  the average billed rate for existing customers declined due to increased subscriptions to lower cost calling plans  which were developed over the past several years to meet the competitive environment 
this decrease at north pittsburgh was partially offset by an increase in both intralata and interlata toll revenues at penn telecom due to the successful bundling of toll with local calling packages 
as of december   of penn telecom s clec customers subscribed to one of its toll packages 
the increase in other operating revenues of  or  was primarily due to the growth in dsl revenues of approximately  as combined dsl lines both wholesale and retail increased from  as of december  to  as of december  this increase was partially offset by higher write offs associated with carrier bankruptcies  most notably worldcom and global crossings 
the decrease in directory advertising  billing and other services revenues of  or  was mostly due to a decrease of in directory advertising revenue and a decrease of in carrier billing and collection revenues 
directory advertising revenues decreased from  in to  in north pittsburgh s five year agreement with its former directory partner expired with the directory 
as the terms proposed by the former directory partner for the next contract greatly decreased north pittsburgh s share of the income generated by the directory  north pittsburgh negotiated a five year contract with a new partner  at terms more advantageous to north pittsburgh 
however  as the former partner continued to publish its directory  the competitive environment increased  resulting in lower revenues generated by north pittsburgh s directory 
we believe that directory advertising revenues will also decrease  but at a much reduced rate of between to  with revenue levels moderating thereafter 
with respect to carrier billing and collection revenues  north pittsburgh has contracts with several ixcs and other telecommunications companies under which it earns fees for performing billing and collection services on behalf of these companies 
north pittsburgh has seen the volume of services and calls billed on behalf of these companies steadily decrease over the past several years 
this decrease is a result of more companies bringing these functions in house as well as a decrease in overall message volume for those carriers remaining with north pittsburgh  due to such factors as wireless substitution 
although we would expect carrier billing and collection revenues to continue to decrease in future years  the impact would not be material as the annual revenue recognized from such services for was only  or  of overall revenue 
operating expenses and net operating income total operating expenses increased  or  during the change was primarily the result of increases in network and other operating expenses of  state and local taxes of  depreciation and amortization expenses of and telecommunications equipment expenses of 
the increase in network and other operating expenses of  or  was due to an increase in operational expenses at penn telecom of  from the increase was mostly due to the underlying growth in penn telecom s clec variable costs associated with the overall growth in access line equivalents and revenue 
une costs in for non facilities based access lines  broadband circuit costs and dsl costs increased approximately  from to support the overall growth in the network  access lines  high capacity circuits and dsl lines in service 
as a result of the more rapid growth in lines than in the prior year as well as increases in the overall size of the network  installation and repair expenses increased in addition  personnel and sales expenses grew approximately in order to support the revenue and organizational growth 
these increases were partially offset by an approximate charge incurred in due to the expensing of 
table of contents operational support system evaluation charges in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
in addition  office and renovation expense decreased  as included a major renovation to a penn telecom facility  and had a increase in performance assurance payments received from verizon  which are recorded as a reduction in operating expenses 
at north pittsburgh  network and other operating expenses for decreased from due to several factors  one of which was a decrease in intralata toll terminating access charge expense 
a decline in mous generated by north pittsburgh toll customers and a decrease in terminating access rates charged by ilecs within the lata produced the decrease 
in addition  with the completion during of the five year modernization of north pittsburgh s network  maintenance expense has decreased from prior year levels as legacy equipment has been upgraded or replaced 
these costs savings were partially offset by an increase in pension expense  healthcare expense and corporate insurance premiums 
also  the prior year period included a charge of approximately to reduce inventory to the lower of cost or market 
at pinnatech  network and other operating expenses for decreased from the decrease was partially a result of approximately in nauticom sports network nsn charges incurred by pinnatech in although the nsn was closed in december of  several contracts were settled for higher amounts than originally accrued for in the restructuring reserve and other miscellaneous charges were incurred during in addition  pinnatech had a lower employee base during  which resulted in a reduction of in salary and related benefits expense 
the downsizing also reduced office and leasing expense by the increase in state and local taxes of  or  was mostly attributable to a increase in public utility realty tax assessment purta expense in at north pittsburgh as included a favorable settlement of previous years overpayments 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of  or  was the result of the increase in the depreciable asset base gross property  plant and equipment of over overall  the increase in total operating revenues of  coupled with the increase in total operating expenses of  resulted in a increase in net operating income in as compared to other items interest expense increased from the prior year by due to the accelerated amortization of of debt issuance costs related to the prepayment of rural telephone bank rtb notes in december of interest income decreased in primarily due to the liquidation of available for sale debt securities in april of and the general decrease in short term money market rates for temporary investments 
the change in sundry income  net was primarily due to a  increase in equity income from our investments in three wireless partnerships 
the growth in equity income was partially offset by an increase in costs expended by the company in exploring strategic alternatives and business arrangements 
associated costs totaled  during as compared to incurred in in addition  we recorded in an investment loss of associated with the other than temporary decline in value of several equity securities 
results of operations vs 
operating revenues total operating revenues increased  during this increase was primarily the result of increases in local network services of   long distance and access services of 
table of contents   telecommunications equipment sales of and other operating revenues of   offset partially by a decrease in directory advertising  billing and other services of 
increases in local network service revenues of  or  were attributable to several factors  one of which was a rate band reclass at north pittsburgh which received pa puc approval and became effective in december of as the density of customers in north pittsburgh s serving area and immediate surrounding territories covered by extended area service agreements increased during the late s and  several of the exchanges in north pittsburgh s territory grew into the next rate band and qualified for an increase in local rates  which contributed approximately  of the  increase in north pittsburgh s basic area revenues 
the remainder of the increase was due to a higher average number of lines in service than the prior year as well as north pittsburgh s revenue neutral chapter filing  which became effective in december of and added approximately  with a corresponding decrease in intrastate access rates 
in addition  vertical feature revenues at north pittsburgh increased in also  penn telecom s basic area and vertical features revenues increased  due to growth in its clec edge out markets 
penn telecom s access lines installed increased from  as of december   to  as of december  in addition  penn telecom s pri revenues increased as circuits grew from approximately circuits to circuits over the same period 
the increase in long distance and access service revenues of  or  was attributable to an increase in high capacity circuits sold special access revenues  offset partially by a decrease in access revenues and a decrease in toll revenues 
special access revenues increased  at north pittsburgh and  at penn telecom  mostly as a result of large increases in the number of ds and ds circuits sold 
access revenues decreased approximately  mostly as a result of a decrease in north pittsburgh s intralata access revenues 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in access revenues at penn telecom due to the large year over year growth in access lines 
toll revenues decreased due to a decrease in intralata toll revenues at north pittsburgh  partially offset by a growth in both intralata and interlata toll revenues at penn telecom 
the decrease in intralata toll revenues at north pittsburgh was mostly a result of a decrease in market share and loss of mous to such competition as wireless and alternative communication technologies such as e mail 
in addition  there was a decrease in the average billed rate due to the development of additional calling plans to meet the competitive environment 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in both intralata and interlata toll revenues at penn telecom due to the successful bundling of toll with local calling packages 
as of december   of penn telecom s clec customers subscribed to one of its toll packages 
telecommunications equipment sales increased  or  due to an increase in pbx and additional equipment sales 
the majority of the increase was due to partially depressed sales for the year ended december   as a result of accelerated purchases in and to address potential year concerns 
the increase in other operating revenues of  or  was primarily due to the growth in dsl revenues of  as combined dsl lines both wholesale and retail increased from  as of december   to  as of december  in addition  net uncollectible revenue charges decreased due to improved cash collection from both retail customers as well as carriers 
the decrease in directory advertising  billing and other services of  or  was mostly due to a decrease of in carrier billing and collection revenues 
operating expenses and net revenues total operating expenses for increased over the preceding year 
the change was primarily the result of increases in depreciation and amortization expenses of and 
table of contents telecommunications equipment expenses of  offset partially by decreases in network and other operating expenses of and state and local taxes of 
the growth in depreciation and amortization expenses of  or  was the direct result of the growth in fixed assets to serve current and future customer needs 
the increase in telecommunications equipment expenses of  or  was a direct result of the increase in telecommunications equipment sales of the decrease in network and other operating expenses of  or  was due to decreases in expenses at north pittsburgh and pinnatech  partially offset by increases in expenses at penn telecom 
at north pittsburgh  network and other operating expenses for decreased by approximately  from due to several factors  one of which was a cost reduction program instituted in the first quarter of the cost reduction program involved not only the elimination of direct external expenses such as a large reduction in the use of outside contractors  but also involved improving operating procedures 
internal processes and procedures were re engineered to maximize both labor and material usage as well as inventory levels 
in addition  with the completion of the five year modernization of north pittsburgh s network during  maintenance expense decreased from prior year levels as legacy equipment was upgraded or replaced 
another factor contributing to the decrease was a  reduction in intralata toll terminating access charge expense 
a decline in mous generated by north pittsburgh toll customers as well as a decrease in terminating access rates charged by ilecs within the lata produced the decrease 
at pinnatech  network and other operating expenses for decreased approximately  from prior year levels 
the decrease was a result of the cessation of costs related to the operating activities and eventual shut down of the nsn in december of the decreases in network and other operating expenses at north pittsburgh and pinnatech were mostly offset by increases in expenses at penn telecom 
clec variable costs  such as the leasing of unes for non facilities based access lines  increased with the overall growth in access lines and revenue 
collocation costs increased as penn telecom expanded into additional incumbent central offices during personnel and operating costs also increased in order to support the revenue growth and overall growth of the network 
in addition  penn telecom incurred an approximate charge associated with the expensing of operational support system evaluation charges in the decrease in state and local taxes of  or  was mostly attributable to a reduction in purta expense in from settlement of previous years overpayments as well as a decrease in pennsylvania capital stock tax due to a reduction in millage rates from the prior year 
overall  the increase in total operating revenues of  coupled with the increase in total operating expenses of  resulted in a increase in net operating revenues in as compared to other items interest expense increased in by due to increased debt borrowings 
interest income decreased in primarily due to the liquidation of available for sale debt securities and the general decrease in short term money market rates for temporary investments during the  change in sundry income  net was primarily due to a  decrease in realized gains on the sale of securities as the majority of our available for sale equity portfolio was liquidated in the prior year  a decrease in dividend income from not holding those equity securities in  in non operating expenses associated with tax adjustments to wireless parternships prior years returns and in costs expended by the company in exploring strategic alternatives and business 
table of contents arrangements 
these factors were partially offset by a increase in equity income from our investments in three wireless partnerships 
liquidity and capital resources december  december  cash and temporary investments working capital long term debt including current maturities cash and temporary investments were  at december  as compared to  at december  the decrease was a result of the retirement of the notes payable to the rtb after the expiration of the notes prepayment penalty periods 
we made  in scheduled principal payments and  in accelerated payments during for the rtb notes 
excluding the  in accelerated debt payments made in december of  we had an underlying  increase in cash during this increase was the result of  in cash generated from operating activities for exceeding all investing and financing activities 
we internally funded of the  in property and equipment additions and expended  for financing activities excluding the debt prepayment described above  including cash dividends and the scheduled repayments of debt and capital lease obligations  during temporary excess funds were invested in short term cash equivalents with maturity dates scheduled to coincide with tax payment due dates  debt principal payments  dividend payment dates and other predictable cash needs 
we expect to continue the investment of such excess funds throughout  which should enable us to satisfactorily meet all short term obligations 
working capital levels at december  decreased  from december   mostly due to the decrease in cash as a result of our prepayment of the rtb notes 
the decrease in long term debt was a result of the scheduled repayment of  of principal and accelerated prepayment of  of principal in as mentioned above  we funded of our expenditures for property and equipment from operations cash flows and cash reserves 
therefore  no additional advances were requested from our available debt facilities 
in  north pittsburgh was granted approval for a loan from the federal financing bank ffb guaranteed by the rus in the maximum principal amount of  the total amount outstanding at december  to the ffb under this loan was  with all advances having a maturity date of december  the unadvanced amount of this facility as of december  was  north pittsburgh can make draws against this facility through june  for qualified capital expenditure projects  as defined in the loan agreement  to furnish and improve telephone service in rural areas 
as of december   north pittsburgh had approximately  of qualified capital expenditures that were eligible to be drawn against this facility 
the notes payable to the ffb are secured by a supplemental mortgage agreement executed by north pittsburgh  which provides that substantially all of the assets of north pittsburgh  which approximate a net book value of  are subject to a lien or a security interest 
such agreement contains restrictions regarding dividends and other distributions by north pittsburgh 
under these restrictions  unless certain working capital levels  net worth levels  and interest expense ratios are maintained  north pittsburgh is not permitted to pay dividends on its capital stock other than in shares of capital stock  or to make any other distributions to its shareholder or purchase  redeem or retire any of its capital stock or make any investment in affiliated companies 
as a result of these restrictions   of north pittsburgh s retained earnings were available for dividends to the registrant as of december  taking into consideration the north pittsburgh restrictions  consolidated retained 
table of contents earnings of approximately  were available for dividends and other distributions to our shareholders as of december  north pittsburgh also has available through june of a  line of credit with the rural telephone finance cooperative at a rate of prime plus 
no borrowings have taken place against the line of credit 
a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  is as follows debt principal capital lease thereafter represents total minimum lease commitments interest and executory costs are included 
consolidated capital expenditure commitments for the purchase and installation of new equipment at december  amounted to approximately  with such amount being part of the construction program  which is projected to be in the range of  to  we expect cash flows provided by operating activities and cash reserves over the next twelve months to be sufficient to service long term debt and capital lease obligations  to pay dividends and to finance all non rus qualified projects 
we expect to continue to have the necessary cash flows from operations and cash reserves to internally finance of our projected capital expenditures 
however  due to the low cost financing available through the rus for qualified north pittsburgh capital expenditures  we may request advancements from the rus facility in the future 
critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most subjective or complex judgments 
these policies are as follows revenue recognition revenues are recognized when local network  long distance  and access services are provided 
local service and intrastate long distance and access service revenues are subject to the jurisdiction of the pa puc 
north pittsburgh participates in interstate pooling arrangements with other telephone companies 
such pools are funded by access service charges regulated by the fcc 
revenue earned through pooling is initially recorded based on estimates 
north pittsburgh has settled substantially all access service arrangements through revenues from equipment sales are recorded after equipment has been installed and accepted by the customer 
impairment of long lived assets based upon the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
a determination of impairment if any is made based on estimates of future undiscounted 
table of contents cash flows 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  prior to this standard  we reviewed our long lived assets according to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we have determined  based on our reviews under the aforementioned standards in the year s in which they were effective  that there had been no impairment to the carrying value of such assets in  or valuation of accounts receivable we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our accounts receivable aging schedules  history of write offs  relationships with our customers and the overall credit worthiness of our customers 
income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
pension and other postretirement benefits we calculate the costs of providing retiree benefits under the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
the key assumptions used in making these calculations are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligation  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
we select discount rates commensurate with current market interest rates on high quality  fixed rate debt securities 
the expected return on assets is based on our current view of the long term returns on assets held by the plan  which is influenced by historical averages 
the medical cost trend rate is based on our actual medical claims and future projections of medical cost trends 
the judgments used in applying the above policies are based on our evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
worldcom bankruptcy on july   worldcom petitioned the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the pre petition amounts which were due to us from worldcom can be broken down into three sub classes as follows outstanding in total to penn telecom  in intrastate revenues outstanding to north pittsburgh  and in interstate revenues outstanding to north pittsburgh 
in the interstate jurisdiction  north pittsburgh participates in a revenue pooling process administered by the national exchange carrier association neca 
uncollectible pre petition interstate amounts  which totaled for north pittsburgh  were submitted to neca for reimbursement via the pooling mechanism 
north pittsburgh was able to recover the majority of the receivables submitted from the pool 
however  as noted in our discussion in our quarterly report on form q for the period ended september  the q  there exists the possibility that north pittsburgh may not be able to retain of the uncollectibles submitted and recovered 
as also described in the q  due to the neca pooling mechanisms  there exists a remote possibility that north pittsburgh may ultimately be liable to reimburse the neca pool in the future for an amount greater than its own receivables submitted and recovered from the pool 
the remaining amounts not subject to the interstate pooling recovery mechanisms penn telecom s receivables of and north pittsburgh s intrastate receivables of were charged as a reduction in revenues in as of the date of this filing  we do not believe that north pittsburgh s exposure to the neca pooling process will have a material effect on our results of operations for as pool earnings for exceeded the authorized rate of  north pittsburgh had recorded as of december  an accrual of for the potential liability associated with the overearnings 
any future material claims by other neca members against the neca pool for worldcom write offs  which would lower 
table of contents north pittsburgh s overall settlement for the period submitted  would also lower the earnings of the pool 
as such  north pittsburgh s liability for any overearnings would also be reduced  although the amount may not be dollar for dollar 
in addition  the initial projected impact on the neca pool may not be as great as originally assessed due to favorable developments in the credit markets  with many offers for assignment of worldcom receivables above cents on the dollar 
neca  acting as an agent for many of its participants  negotiated a claim sale agreement on march  with deutsche bank for cents on the dollar 
north pittsburgh  acting as an early participant  achieved a recovery of of the total amount recovered  the which represented a recovery of interstate receivables will be remitted back to the neca pool as north pittsburgh had already collected its entire write off from the pool in august of and the which represented a recovery of intrastate receivables will be recognized in the first quarter of we are still in the process of reviewing offers for penn telecom s worldcom receivables 
nsn restructuring in the fourth quarter of  we shutdown the nsn 
the sports network division of pinnatech had been providing broadcasts of high school and small college sporting events as well as other sports programming 
during  the nsn had expanded its coverage from western pennsylvania into several other states 
although the growth in the popularity of the site and concept met management s expectations  the revenue generating model  based mostly on advertising revenues  failed to support the projected level of continued capital investment and operating expenses 
a pretax charge of was recorded during in network and other operating expenses to cover the restructuring costs associated with the shutdown of the nsn 
the total charges reduced net income by the business restructuring charge of included restructuring liabilities of and asset impairments of the restructuring liabilities consisted of for employee severance payments and related taxes for people who were involuntarily terminated  for future operating lease expense associated with a leased facility under contract which will no longer be used and for other charges associated with the restructuring 
as of december   all employees had been terminated and all severance payments and related taxes had been paid 
during  total net cash expenditures related to nsn were an additional net was recorded as expense in  due primarily to the settlement of a contract for satellite equipment and airtime above our original estimate and the inability to generate the expected sub lease contracts for the facility under lease  offset partially by the sale of nsn fixed assets with a net book value of for a gain 
during  total nsn related cash expenditures were  and a reduction in expense was recorded due to the reversal of miscellaneous accruals 
as of december   the remaining restructuring accrual liability  relating solely to future operating lease payments  was regulatory matters both north pittsburgh and penn telecom are subject to regulatory oversight by the pa puc for intrastate services and the fcc for interstate services 
the pa puc and the fcc have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities with respect to service and facilities  rates and charges  securities  the encumbering or disposition of public utility properties  accounting and various other matters 

table of contents in  congress passed the act  which has the goal of opening the telecommunications industry to further competition for all services 
the act prohibits state legislative or regulatory restrictions or barriers to entry regarding the provision of local telephone service 
it also requires most ilecs to interconnect with the networks of other telecommunications carriers  unbundle their services into network elements  offer their telecommunications services at wholesale rates to allow the resale of such services and allow other telecommunications carriers to locate equipment on their premises 
local exchange telephone carriers are also required to compensate each other for the transport and termination of calls 
the fcc has issued a number of rulemakings that continue to implement the requirements of the act 
the clear intent of the act was to open up the local exchange market to competition 
the act appears to mandate  among other items  that north pittsburgh  at some point in time  permit the resale of its services at wholesale rates  provide number portability  provide dialing parity  provide interconnection to any requesting carrier for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access and provide access to network elements 
north pittsburgh s wireline operations are considered rural under the act and are exempt from certain of the foregoing obligations unless  in response to a bona fide request for interconnection  the pa puc removes that exemption 
north pittsburgh  along with a number of other rural companies in pennsylvania  was granted a temporary suspension until july  of certain interconnection requirements in the act applicable to ilecs as they relate to non facilities based competition 
in that proceeding  however  facilities based competition was permitted in the north pittsburgh service area 
north pittsburgh  along with a number of other rural companies in pennsylvania  filed a petition with the pa puc on june  requesting an additional three year extension of the suspension to july  on january   the pa puc denied the request for the extension of the suspension 
in response to the pa puc denial  north pittsburgh on january  filed a petition for clarification and modification of the denial order 
the petition asked for clarification and modification of portions of the order in regard to the potential future issues dealing with burden of proof when reviewing whether to remove a rural exemption 
in addition  on february   north pittsburgh and other rural companies also filed a petition for review in the commonwealth court of pennsylvania which requests that the court reverse the pa puc decision as the order was not supported by the evidence  was contrary to law and was arbitrary and capricious 
the pa puc acted on the petition for clarification and modification on march  granting it in part and confirming that the burden of proof in a proceeding challenging a rural exemption rests with the competitor 
the pa puc also clarified that total economic burden in a section proceeding includes consideration of the economic burden typically associated with competitive entry 
if the pa puc s march  order is not appealed  consideration will be given to withdrawing the petition for review of the january  order which was filed with the commonwealth court 
the provision of interstate toll and access services by north pittsburgh and penn telecom is subject to the regulatory scrutiny of the fcc 
terms  conditions and rates for interstate toll and access services are filed in interstate tariffs for review and approval by the fcc 
however  beginning august   the fcc has no longer required non dominant interstate toll providers  including penn telecom  to file tariffs for their interstate toll services 
penn telecom now informs its toll customers of the rates  terms and conditions through written notice 
in october of  the fcc adopted an order referred to as the multi association group  or mag order  that modified the interstate access charge rules and universal service support system for rate of return ror ilecs 
north pittsburgh is subject to this order 
according to the fcc  the new rules  which went into effect january   are intended to accomplish the following three goals align the interstate access rate structure more closely with the manner in which costs for access are incurred  replace implicit support for universal service with explicit support that is portable to all eligible telecommunications carriers on a competitively neutral basis  and provide certainty and stability for small and mid sized local telephone companies serving rural and high cost areas by permitting these carriers to continue to set interstate access rates based on a ror of  thereby encouraging investment in rural america 

table of contents the mag order had the following effects increased flat rate charges referred to as subscriber line charges slcs that are billed to residential and business customers  and decreased per minute of use switched access charges billed to interexchange toll providers that originate and terminate traffic on a ilec s network 
the mag order also created a new universal service support mechanism  interstate common line support icls 
the icls replaces the carrier common line ccl charge  which was previously billed to interexchange toll providers 
the icls was phased in beginning july of and the ccl will be eliminated as of july of the initial effect of the implementation of the mag order on north pittsburgh is expected to be revenue neutral 
at the same time the mag order was adopted  the fcc also issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on an incentive regulation plan for ilecs which are now under ror regulation in the interstate jurisdiction 
because the outcome of this proceeding is not yet known  we are not able to predict the effect that it may have on our operations and revenues 
in february of  the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nprm regarding the possible classification of wireline broadband internet access as an information service rather than a telecommunications service 
should the fcc adopt this proposed ruling  it may remove network based broadband offerings such as dsl services from regulation under the fcc 
however  in the nprm  the fcc also asked whether it should extend universal service fund usf requirements to not only facilities based wireline broadband internet service providers bisps but also wireless  cable tv and satellite bisps 
should the fcc extend a usf contribution requirement to all bisps  north pittsburgh  penn telecom and pinnatech would be affected 
because the outcome of this proceeding is unknown at this time  we are unable to determine the effect such action may have on our operations and revenues 
in february of  the fcc also issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the possible reformation of the system for assessing and recovering usf funds 
in that proceeding  the fcc has asked for comment on whether it should assess carrier contributions based on the number and capacity of connections that contributing carriers provide to customers  rather than on the current method  which is based on the interstate revenues they earn 
should the fcc reform the current system for assessing and recovering usf funds  north pittsburgh  penn telecom and pinnatech would be affected by the change 
because the outcome of this proceeding is unknown at this time  we are unable to determine the effect such action may have on our operations and revenues 
on february   the fcc released its decision regarding the triennial review of the act 
the decision dealt with several issues that may affect north pittsburgh and penn telecom 
generally  it appears that the decision eliminates unbundling requirements for ilecs in regard to broadband services provided over fiber facilities but continues unbundled access to mass market narrowband loops 
in addition  ilecs are not required to unbundle packet switching services 
also  the fcc found that the high frequency portion of the loop  also referred to as line sharing  is no longer required to be provided as an une and will therefore be phased out over three years 
the fcc also found that ilecs will no longer have to offer the local switching une for business customers served by high capacity loops 
the states have days to rebut this finding 
for mass market customers served by narrowband loops  the fcc set out specific criteria that states shall apply to determine if switching should no longer be available as an une 
upon a state ruling eliminating switching as an une for mass market customers  the fcc set forth a three year period for carriers to transition off unbundled network element platform une p  which is a service that bundles une switching with other unes such as une loop to provide the entire local service platform 
the actual fcc order explaining the decision in detail has not yet been released 
without knowing the actual final details of the order  we 
table of contents are unable to gauge the eventual effect that the decision will have on north pittsburgh and penn telecom 
in that north pittsburgh is not yet required to offer unes to competitors  there should be no immediate effect on north pittsburgh due to the decision 
in regard to penn telecom  because it does not currently utilize either line sharing or une p  it is believed that the decision will initially have little effect on penn telecom s operations or revenues 
effective january   north pittsburgh moved from ror regulation in the intrastate jurisdiction to an alternative form of regulation  which is a price cap plan 
under north pittsburgh s price cap plan  rates for non competitive intrastate services are allowed to increase based on an index that measures economy wide price increases less a productivity offset 
there is no limitation on earnings under this plan 
the terms of the plan also allow north pittsburgh to rebalance rates once each year to allow north pittsburgh to gradually realign its intrastate rate structure on a more rational cost and market basis in order to meet future competition 
in addition  as competition develops in the future  north pittsburgh may file with the pa puc to declare certain services competitive and thereby be freed from all rate regulation for those services

on september   the pa puc issued an order dealing with a variety of issues impacting lecs in pennsylvania 
referred to as the global order  it dealt with certain issues that affected north pittsburgh 
specifically  the order allowed north pittsburgh to rebalance and lower access charges in order to prepare north pittsburgh to meet competition in its serving area 
the reduction in access charges was offset in part by reimbursements from an interim pa universal service fund pa usf that is funded by all telecommunications providers excluding wireless in the state 
because the rebalancing and reduction of access charges were offset by reimbursement from the fund  north pittsburgh has not experienced any significant impact on operations or revenues as a result of the global order 
the pa puc  in the global order  indicated that it would commence another proceeding on or after january  to examine further changes to the pa usf and possible additional access charge reform 
by secretarial letter dated february   the pa puc granted a coalition of rural telephone companies  including north pittsburgh  a ninety day extension until april  in which to submit a proposal to the pa puc outlining proposed changes in access charges and the fund along with a timeline for these changes 
the rural coalition submitted its proposal on april  other parties also submitted proposals  including sprint 
upon review of the initial proposals filed in the access charge reform proceeding  the rural coalition and sprint  through negotiation  combined and then filed a joint access proposal in response to the access charge investigation on december  the joint access proposal was supported in filed statements by the pa office of consumer advocate  the pa office of small business advocate and the pa puc office of trial staff 
under the joint access proposal  the pa usf would generally continue through with only minor changes 
the proposed plan allows for all the local exchange companies in pennsylvania  with the exception of verizon and verizon north  to continue gradual revenue neutral rate rebalancings 
as proposed  companies would be allowed to reduce access charges and offset the reductions through increases in local rates or by increased disbursements from the pa usf 
action by the pa puc on the joint access proposal is expected before the end of because the outcome of the proceeding is unknown  we are unable to determine the effect on our operations and revenues
