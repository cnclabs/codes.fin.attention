item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements  including the related notes  presented in this annual report on form k 
subsequent events since the end of our fiscal year  we have announced the following events in january  we announced that we had entered into a five year agreement with mds proteomics inc mdsp  a subsidiary of mds inc  to utilize mdsp s technologies with the objective of accelerating the clinical development of and broadening the market opportunities for our pipeline of small chemical compounds 
mdsp will receive payments upon the successful achievement of specified milestones and will receive royalties on sales of products resulting from the collaboration 
as part of the agreement  we purchased from mdsp a million convertible note due the note is convertible into mdsp s common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment if mdsp sells shares of its common stock at a lower price 
on february   we announced that the fda had accepted an anda for a generic form of modafinil  the active ingredient found in provigil 
on march   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in us district court in new jersey against teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc  mylan pharmaceuticals inc  ranbaxy pharmaceuticals inc  and barr laboratories  inc based upon the andas filed by each of these companies seeking fda approval for a generic equivalent of modafinil 
the lawsuit claims infringement of our us patent no 
re  which covers the pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment with the form of modafinil contained in provigil 
we intend to vigorously defend the validity  and prevent infringement  of this patent 
on march   our wholly owned subsidiary  cephalon australia pty 
limited  formally commenced a takeover bid for sirtex medical limited asx srx 
sirtex markets sir spheres  a product approved in the united states  europe  australia and portions of asia for the treatment of liver cancer 
under its bid  cephalon australia intends to offer a cash for each sirtex ordinary share including any sirtex shares that are issued on the exercise of sirtex options 
cephalon australia also has obtained an option to acquire shares from sirtex s largest shareholder representing up to percent of the total issued share capital of sirtex at a price of a per sirtex share 
the total bid value is approximately us million 
if successful  we intend to fund the bid price using a portion of our existing cash balance 
we believe there are a number of risks inherent in sirtex s business  post acquisition 
specifically  we believe that we will need to significantly increase manufacturing capacity to meet projected demand in the us and european markets over the next few years 
increasing capacity in the pharmaceutical industry is expensive  time consuming and requires approval of appropriate regulatory authorities 
until such expansions are complete  there can be no assurance that product will be available to satisfy anticipated demand for sir spheres 
we also believe that substantial investment will be necessary in many other aspects of sirtex s business  including sales  marketing and distribution  for us to realize the full potential of its technologies 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are developed  and challenged periodically  by management based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of their judgment 
management considers the following policies to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties associated with the complex judgments made by us that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
revenue recognition product sales are recognized upon the transfer of ownership and risk of loss for the product to the customer and are recorded net of estimated reserves for contractual allowances  discounts and returns 
contractual allowances result from sales under contracts with managed care organizations and government agencies 
we determine the reserve for contractual allowances by estimating prescriptions to be filled for individuals covered by government agencies and managed care organizations with which we have contracts 
we permit product returns with respect to unused pharmaceuticals based on expiration dating of our product 
we determine the reserve for product returns by reviewing the history of each product s returns and by estimating the amount of expected future product returns relating to current product sales 
we utilize reports from wholesalers and other external  independent sources that produce prescription data 
we review this data to monitor product movement through the supply chain to identify remaining inventory in the supply chain that may result in reserves for contractual allowances or returns 
to date  product returns have not been material 
we review our reserves for contractual allowances  discounts and returns at each reporting period and adjust these reserves as necessary to reflect data available at that time 
to the extent we adjust the reserves  the amount of net product sales revenue recognized will fluctuate 
other revenue  which includes revenues from collaborative agreements  consists primarily of up front fees  ongoing research and development funding  milestone payments and certain payments under co promotional or managed services agreements 
non refundable up front fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement  but  in practice  our actual performance may vary from our estimate 
we adjust the performance periods  if appropriate  based upon available facts and circumstances  though our assessment of such facts and circumstances requires us to use our judgment and experience 
we recognize periodic payments for research and development activities over the period that we perform the related activities under the terms of the agreements 
revenue resulting from the achievement of milestone events stipulated in the agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved 
milestones are based upon the occurrence of a substantive element specified in the contract or as a measure of substantive progress towards completion under the contract 
payments under co promotional or managed services agreements are recognized over the period when the products are sold or the promotional activities are performed 
the portion of the payments that represent reimbursement of our expenses are recognized as an offset to those expenses in our statement of income 
inventories our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  and include the cost of raw materials  labor  overhead and shipping and handling costs 
inventories are valued at standard cost  with variances between standard and actual costs recorded as an adjustment to cost of product sales or  if material  apportioned to inventory and cost of product sales 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in our opinion  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  we establish a reserve against the inventories carrying value 
our determination that a valuation reserve might be required  in addition to the quantification of such reserve  requires us to utilize significant judgment 
we base our analysis  in part  on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements over the next months and the expiration dates of raw materials and finished goods 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated decreases in demand could have a material impact on the carrying value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
to date  inventory adjustments have not been material 
valuation of property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets our property and equipment has been recorded at cost and is being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of those assets 
our intangible assets which consist primarily of developed technology  trademarks  and product and marketing rights  are amortized over estimated useful lives which are intended to approximate the estimated pattern of economic benefits generated by the asset 
determining the estimated pattern of economic benefit for an intangible asset is a highly subjective and difficult assessment 
to the extent that the pattern cannot be reliably determined  a straight line amortization method may be used 
in conjunction with acquisitions of businesses or product rights  we allocate the purchase price based upon the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in certain circumstances  fair value may be assigned to purchased in process technology and expensed immediately 
we regularly assess whether intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill have been impaired and adjust the carrying values of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that some or all of the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operating performances of our businesses and products 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the carrying values of our property and equipment  intangible assets or goodwill are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
no impairment losses have been recorded to date 
we evaluate the recoverability and measure the possible impairment of our goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment test is a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step screens for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
our estimate of fair value considers publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of our company  as well as i publicly available information regarding comparable publicly traded companies in the pharmaceutical industry  ii the financial projections and future prospects of our business  including our growth opportunities and likely operational improvements  and iii comparable sales prices  if available 
as part of the first step to assess potential impairment  we compare our estimate of fair value for the company to the book value of our consolidated net assets 
if the book value of our consolidated net assets were greater than our estimate of fair value  we would then proceed to the second step to measure the impairment  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination  and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is greater than its implied fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess 
we performed our annual test of impairment of goodwill as of july  we have only one reporting unit  a pharmaceutical unit  that constitutes our entire business 
we compared the fair value of this reporting unit with its carrying value 
our quoted market value at july  was used as the fair value of the reporting unit 
since the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at july   no adjustment to our goodwill for impairment is necessary 
on a quarterly basis  we perform a review of our business to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of our company and its goodwill 
if we determine that such events or changes in circumstances have occurred  we would consult with one or more valuation specialists in estimating the impact of these on our estimate of fair value 
we believe the estimation methods are reasonable and reflective of common valuation practices 
income taxes we have provided for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
prior to  we had a history of losses from our operations  which generated significant international  federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will not be recovered 
based on our profitability for the year ended december  and projected future results  in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  and therefore  we reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance 
as a result  beginning in  we will begin to provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our estimated combined federal and state effective rates 
subsequent adjustments to our estimates of our ability to recover the deferred tax assets could cause our provision for income taxes to vary from period to period 
recent accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no longer requires the amortization of goodwill  rather  goodwill will be subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
in addition  an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
such acquired intangible assets will be amortized over the period in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up 
the new criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill did not require us to reclassify any of our intangible assets 
we have only recorded goodwill related to our acquisition of group lafon 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires recognition of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets when a legal obligation to incur such costs arises as a result of the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense over the asset s useful life 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this new standard will not have any impact on our current financial statements 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of and also broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
the adoption of this new standard has not had a material impact on our current financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement amends or rescinds certain existing authoritative pronouncements including sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses on extinguishment of debt  such that the provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions must now be followed to determine if the early extinguishment of debt should be classified as an extraordinary item 
in addition  any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods that does not meet the criteria in apb must be reclassified 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  we adopted this new standard effective december  and reclassified all gains and losses on early extinguishment of debt as other income and expense  rather than extraordinary items  in our current financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance in emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the statement requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recorded at their fair values when a liability has been incurred 
sfas is effective for disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of this new standard will not have any impact on our current financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the alternative methods of transition and additional disclosure requirements of sfas are effective january  in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees 
this interpretation requires that upon the issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
fin is effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of this new statement will not have any impact on our current financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation addresses consolidation of variable interest entities where an enterprise does not have voting control over the entity but has a controlling financial interest in the entity 
fin is effective for all financial statements issued after september  as a result of the adoption of this standard  cephalon clinical partners  lp will be consolidated in our financial statements 
this consolidation will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
results of operations for the year ended december  revenues consisted of the following in thousands product sales provigil    actiq    gabitril    group lafon products  total product sales    other revenues h 
lundbeck a s    novartis pharma ag   sanofi synth labo   other    total other revenues    total revenues    year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total product sales in increased over the increase is attributable to a number of factors including sales of provigil increased by compared to last year 
this increase was the net result of strong underlying demand for provigil in the us as evidenced by a increase in prescriptions filled over last year and a price increase effective june  these increases were partially offset by the reduction during of higher than normal inventory levels which existed at certain wholesalers at the end of due to significant speculative buying 
sales of actiq increased compared to last year 
domestic sales increased driven by a increase in us prescriptions filled 
after our merger with anesta corp 
in october  we established a dedicated sales force for actiq and have made ongoing changes to our marketing approach including hiring additional sales representatives and targeting our marketing efforts to pain specialists  all of which have contributed to sales growth 
a domestic price increase of effective march  also contributed to higher revenues 
sales of gabitril increased compared to last year as a result of a increase in us market demand driven by an expansion of our sales force and marketing efforts during  a average us price increase effective march   and the initiation of our european sales efforts  following the december acquisition of european rights to gabitril  which yielded million in sales 
product sales generated by group lafon  which we acquired on december   were million during the most significant product sales during the year were million of spasfon  used for biliary urinary tract spasm and irritable bowel syndrome 
sales of modiodal  the trade name for modafinil in france  were million for amounts recorded as other revenues consist primarily of amortization of up front fees  ongoing research and development funding  milestone payments and certain payments under co promotional or managed services agreements 
total other revenues increased from year to year 
the increase is predominantly a result of the recognition of a full year of revenue recorded under our collaboration agreement with sanofi synthelabo which became effective in the fourth quarter of cost of product sales the cost of product sales in decreased to of product sales from in principally due to the improvement in provigil margins as a result of our acquisition of group lafon 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million for from million for million of the increase is the result of research and development expenses incurred at group lafon during for which there are no comparable amounts in approximately million of this increase is due to higher expenditures on our clinical trials  including phase clinical studies for cep  studies related to our efforts to expand the label for provigil and to explore the utility of gabitril beyond their respective indications  and increased infrastructure costs to support the growing number of ongoing clinical trials 
approximately million of the increase is attributable to expenditures on development costs for compounds that have progressed into later stages of development 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for primarily as a result of million of group lafon expenses for which there are no comparable amounts in and million associated with the expansion of both our us field sales force and promotional expenses for our products 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million during from million during  of which million is attributable to amortization of intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of group lafon and million is attributable to depreciation for property and equipment acquired from group lafon and depreciation from capitalized building improvements at our west chester and salt lake city locations 
the remainder of the increase is due to amortization expense associated with the capitalization of various payments in for additional product rights 
acquired in process research and development in connection with our acquisition of group lafon in december  we acquired the rights to certain early stage technologies 
based on an independent appraisal of the assets acquired from group lafon  the fair value of these technologies of million was recorded as acquired in process research and development expense in because  at the date of the acquisition  the technologies acquired had not progressed to a stage where they met technological feasibility and there existed a significant amount of uncertainty as to our ability to complete the development of the technologies and achieve market acceptance within a reasonable timeframe 
in addition  the acquired in process technologies did not have an alternative future use to us that had reached technological feasibility 
interest income interest income increased by million from due to higher average investment balances partially offset by lower average rates of return in interest expense interest expense increased by million from due primarily to a full year of interest recorded on the convertible subordinated notes issued in may and december of debt exchange expense in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
induced conversions of convertible debt  we recorded a non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter of associated with the exchange of million of our convertible notes for our common stock 
gain charge on early extinguishment of debt in december  we formed a joint venture with an unaffiliated third party investor to fund additional commercial activities in support of provigil and gabitril in the united states 
in exchange for our transfer to the joint venture of certain intellectual property and other rights related to these two products  we received a class b interest  representing a interest in the joint venture 
in exchange for its contribution of million in cash to the joint venture  the investor received class a interests  also representing a interest in the joint venture 
we accounted for this transaction by recording the investor s class a interest of million as long term debt on our balance sheet at december  on march   we acquired the investor s class a interests and ended the joint venture by the issuance and sale in a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due march the purchase of the unaffiliated third party investor s class a interests in connection with the termination of the joint venture resulted in the recognition of an extinguishment of debt charge of million during the first quarter of in may  we paid million to novartis pharma ag for deferred obligations due to them under our november collaboration agreement 
in connection with this payment  we recorded a gain on the early extinguishment of debt during the second quarter of of million 
other expense other expense primarily represents the effect of changes in the currency exchange value of the pound sterling gbp and the euro relative to the settlement of transactions in other currencies  and to an increase in the currency exchange value of the gbp relative to our other foreign operations currencies that are remeasured into the gbp for financial reporting purposes 
income tax benefit  net we recorded a net income tax benefit of million in in light of our expectations for continued profitability  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize a portion of the benefit of the accumulated international  federal and state net operating losses  and federal research and development credits 
we reduced the valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets accordingly 
the recognition of these deferred tax assets had no impact on our cash flows 
this income tax benefit was partially offset by current year income tax expense primarily associated with our group lafon operations 
cumulative effect of changing inventory costing method from fifo to lifo effective january   we changed our method of valuing domestic inventories from the first in  first out  or fifo method  to the last in  first out  or lifo method 
we recognized a charge of million in the first quarter of as the cumulative effect of adopting the lifo inventory costing method 
the acquisition of group lafon s manufacturing operations and the planned expansion of our internal manufacturing capacity for actiq has reduced and is expected to further reduce our reliance on third party manufacturers 
the expansion of our internal manufacturing capabilities should allow us to benefit from efficiencies of scale and lead to lower per unit inventory cost 
the lifo method will reflect these expected changes to manufacturing costs on the statement of operations on a timelier basis  resulting in a better matching of current costs of products sold with product revenues 
cost of product sales under the lifo inventory costing method was million lower in than it would have been under the fifo method 
dividends on convertible exchangeable preferred stock as of december   there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding and  therefore  no dividends were recorded in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues product sales in increased over the increase is attributable to a number of factors including sales of provigil increased from million in to million in the sales increase was due to higher sales resulting from increased market acceptance  as well as a domestic price increase that took effect in the second quarter of sales of actiq increased from million in to million in after our merger with anesta in october  we established a dedicated sales force for actiq and significantly changed the marketing approach 
an average domestic price increase in the second quarter of also contributed to higher recorded sales 
sales of gabitril increased from million in to million in we acquired all us rights to gabitril from abbott laboratories during late and began selling gabitril effective january  prior to  our gabitril revenues represented compensation from abbott under a collaborative agreement where we received a percentage of gabitril sales in excess of a base amount 
additionally  an average increase in domestic prices of in the second quarter of also contributed to the sales increase 
other revenues increased by million  or 
this increase was due primarily to revenues recognized under our uk joint marketing agreement with novartis pharma ag  which we entered into in november  and revenues recognized under our licensing  development and marketing collaboration with sanofi synth labo  which became effective in the fourth quarter of cost of product sales cost of product sales rose in to million from million in primarily as a result of the increase in product sales volumes 
aggregate cost of product sales for all three products remained at of product sales for both and due to decreased costs for us production of actiq offset by gabitril revenues of million in that did not have corresponding cost of product sales since it was being sold under a collaborative agreement with abbott 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased in to million from million in the increase is attributable to higher expenditures on clinical trials including infrastructure costs to support the growing number of ongoing clinical trials including phase clinical studies for cep and studies of provigil related to our efforts to expand the label for provigil beyond its current indication 
in addition  research and development expenses also increased because of regulatory and intellectual property fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased in to million from million in the increase is primarily due to increases in expenditures of million associated with the growth of our internal sales force to promote and support provigil  actiq  and gabitril in the united states 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in from million in primarily due to a full year of amortization expense in on intangible assets acquired during late relating to both our acquisition of gabitril product rights in the united states and our uk joint marketing agreement with novartis 
certain charges in we recorded million representing the final royalty payment associated with the revenue sharing notes and million in merger and integration costs as a result of the merger with anesta 
acquired in process research and development in connection with our acquisition of group lafon in december  we acquired the rights to certain early stage technologies 
based on an independent appraisal of the assets acquired from group lafon  the fair value of these technologies of million was recorded as acquired in process research and development expense in because  at the date of the acquisition  the technologies acquired had not progressed to a stage where they met technological feasibility and there existed a significant amount of uncertainty as to our ability to complete the development of the technologies and achieve market acceptance within a reasonable timeframe 
in addition  the acquired in process technologies did not have an alternative future use to us that had reached technological feasibility 
during  we acquired us marketing rights to gabitril in a transaction that resulted in us recording million as acquired in process research and development expense 
at the acquisition date  we were committed to completing advanced clinical studies for gabitril and developing additional uses for the drug 
ongoing and proposed projects included plans to develop gabitril for additional indications including the treatment of general anxiety disorder  post traumatic stress disorder  insomnia and other conditions 
at the acquisition date  approximately million had been incurred toward completion of the in process research and development projects  and we expected to spend an additional million to complete clinical testing and maintain the product 
multiple projects will be initiated in to support the development of gabitril in additional indications 
however  development will continue in these areas for a period of two to three years 
interest income interest income decreased to million in from million in primarily due to million of interest income recorded in associated with the waiver of an interest rate penalty by the commonwealth of pennsylvania on a loan used to finance the purchase of our west chester facilities 
the remaining decrease in interest income is due to lower average interest rates in as compared to  offset in part by higher average investment balances 
interest expense interest expense increased in to million from million in due to interest on our convertible subordinated notes issued in may and december of  a million fee associated with establishing a line of credit for the group lafon acquisition and interest recognized on our obligations to abbott and novartis 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to the retirement of revenue sharing notes in the first quarter of debt exchange expense in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
induced conversions of convertible debt  we recorded a non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter of associated with the exchange of million of our convertible notes for our common stock 
gain on early extinguishment of debt in may  we paid million to novartis pharma ag for deferred obligations due to them under our continuing november collaboration agreement 
in connection with this payment  we recorded a gain on the early extinguishment of debt of million 
other expense other expense represents an increase in currency exchange value of the pound sterling gbp relative to both the us dollar and to our other foreign operations currencies that are remeasured into the gbp for financial reporting purposes 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle we adopted the us securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab on revenue recognition and  as a result  we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of to defer upfront license fees associated with our collaborative alliances that were previously recognized in revenues 
these payments will be recognized over the performance periods of the alliances 
dividends on convertible exchangeable preferred stock preferred dividends in were less than in due to the conversion during the second and third quarters of of all outstanding shares of preferred stock into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
as of december   there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
joint venture in december  we formed a joint venture with unaffiliated third party investors to fund additional commercial activities in support of provigil and gabitril in the united states 
in exchange for our transfer to the joint venture of certain intellectual property and other rights related to these two products  we received a class b interest  representing a interest in the joint venture 
in exchange for its contribution of million in cash to the joint venture  the investors received class a interests  also representing a interest in the joint venture 
at december   the million investors class a interest was recorded on our balance sheet as debt  and the joint venture s cash balance of million was included in our balance of cash and cash equivalents 
on march   we acquired the investors class a interests and ended the joint venture by issuing to the investors  through a private placement  million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due march the notes are convertible into our common stock  at the option of the holder  at a price of per share 
the purchase of the investor s class a interests in the joint venture resulted in the recognition of a charge of million on the early extinguishment of debt during the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  were million  representing of total assets 
working capital was million at december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily the result of higher net income in net cash used for provided by investing activities net cash used for investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million in net cash used for investing activities was higher in primarily as a result of the acquisition of group lafon  net of cash acquired  for million  offset by additional acquisitions of intangible assets during specific intangible asset investments included a payment of million for the october acquisition of actiq marketing rights in certain countries from elan and a payment of million to abbott pursuant to the extension of the gabitril composition of matter patent 
higher property and equipment purchases in related to the expansion of our manufacturing capacity at our facilities in salt lake city  utah  and france also contributed to the difference 
net cash provided by used for financing activities net cash used for financing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in the period to period change is primarily the result of net proceeds received from the may and december issuances of convertible subordinated notes 
during  we also made dividend payments of million on the previously outstanding shares of convertible  exchangeable preferred stock 
all outstanding preferred shares were converted during the second and third quarters of into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
commitments and contingencies legal proceedings on march   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in us district court in new jersey against teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc  mylan pharmaceuticals inc  ranbaxy pharmaceuticals inc  and barr laboratories  inc based upon the andas filed by each of these companies seeking fda approval for a generic equivalent of modafinil 
the lawsuit claims infringement of our us patent no 
re  which covers the pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment with the form of modafinil contained in provigil 
we intend to vigorously defend the validity  and prevent infringement  of this patent 
we are a party to certain other litigation in the ordinary course of our business  including  among others  us patent interference proceedings  european patent oppositions  and matters alleging employment discrimination  product liability and breach of commercial contract 
we are vigorously defending ourselves in all of the actions against us and do not believe these matters  even if adversely adjudicated or settled  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
standby letters of credit as of december   we had a million standby letter of credit outstanding 
other commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes our obligations to make future payments under current contracts in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt      capital lease obligations   operating leases      convertible notes   other long term liabilities on balance sheet    total contractual cash obligations    in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of our in licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  we have not recorded a liability on our balance sheet for any such contingencies 
cephalon clinical partners  lp in august  we exclusively licensed our rights to myotrophin for human therapeutic use within the united states  canada and europe to cephalon clinical partners  lp ccp 
a subsidiary of cephalon is the sole general partner of ccp 
we developed myotrophin on behalf of ccp under a research and development agreement 
under this agreement  ccp granted an exclusive license to manufacture and market myotrophin for human therapeutic use within the united states  canada and europe  and we agreed to make royalty payments equal to a percentage of product sales and a milestone payment of approximately million upon regulatory approval 
we have a contractual option  but not an obligation  to purchase all of the limited partnership interests of ccp  which is exercisable upon the occurrence of certain events following the first commercial sale of myotrophin 
if  and only if  we decide to exercise this purchase option  we would make an advance payment of approximately million in cash or  at our election  approximately million in shares of common stock or a combination thereof 
if we discontinue development of myotrophin  or if we do not exercise this purchase option  our license will terminate and all rights to manufacture or market myotrophin in the united states  canada and europe will revert to ccp  which may then commercialize myotrophin itself or license or assign its rights to a third party 
in that event  we would not receive any benefits from such commercialization  license or assignment of rights 
outlook cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  were million 
we expect to use these funds for working capital and general corporate purposes  including the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights  or technologies  the payment of contractual obligations  including scheduled interest payments on our convertible notes  and or the purchased  redemption or retirement of our convertible notes 
prior to  we had negative cash flows from operations and used the proceeds of public and private placements of our equity and debt securities to fund operations 
we expect that projected increases in sales of our three primary marketed products  provigil  actiq and gabitril  in combination with other revenues  will allow us to continue to generate profits and significant positive cash flows from operations in at this time  however  we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on future product sales such as the degree of market acceptance and exclusivity of our products  competition  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our efforts to demonstrate the utility of our products in indications beyond those already included in the fda approved labels 
analysis of prescription data for provigil in the united states indicates physicians have elected to prescribe the product to treat indications outside of its currently labeled indication of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy 
our strategy for provigil is to broaden the range of clinical uses that are approved by the fda and european regulatory agencies to include many of its currently prescribed uses 
to that end  we have filed an snda with the fda requesting marketing approval of provigil in the united states for the treatment of excessive sleepiness associated with disorders of sleep and wakefulness in adults 
if the fda does not approve the snda  it is not clear what impact  if any  this may have in and beyond on physicians who currently prescribe provigil for indications other than narcolepsy 
however  without this expanded label  our sales of provigil in and beyond may not continue to grow at their current rate 
continued sales growth of provigil beyond the december expiration of orphan drug exclusivity depends  in part  on our maintaining protection on the modafinil particle size patent 
the fda also could grant us a six month extension of this exclusivity if we perform an additional clinical study of provigil in pediatric patients 
our sales of actiq also depend on our existing patent protection  which will begin to expire in the us in may in february  we announced that the fda has accepted an anda for a generic form of modafinil 
on march   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in us district court in new jersey against teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc  mylan pharmaceuticals inc  ranbaxy pharmaceuticals inc  and barr laboratories  inc 
based upon the andas filed by each of these companies seeking fda approval for a generic equivalent of modafinil 
the lawsuit claims infringement of our us patent no 
re  which covers the pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment with the form of modafinil contained in provigil 
we intend to vigorously defend the validity  and prevent infringement  of this patent 
however  these efforts will be expensive and ultimately may be unsuccessful 
see certain risks related to our business 
we expect to continue to incur significant expenditures associated with manufacturing  selling and marketing our products and conducting additional clinical studies to explore the utility of these products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their respective labels 
with respect to provigil  we plan to conduct pivotal clinical trials in adhd in with respect to gabitril  we expect to perform larger studies in at least one clinical area in we also expect to continue to incur significant expenditures to fund research and development activities  including clinical trials  for our other product candidates and for improved formulations for our existing products 
in the future  we may desire to mitigate the risk in our research and development programs by seeking sources of funding for a portion of these expenses through collaborative arrangements with third parties 
however  we intend to retain a portion of the commercial rights to these programs and  as a result  we still expect to spend significant funds on our share of the cost of these programs  including the costs of research  preclinical development  clinical research and manufacturing 
we may have significant fluctuations in quarterly results based primarily on the level and timing of product sales and cost of product sales  inventory stocking or destocking practices of our large customers  achievement and timing of research and development milestones  collaboration revenues  cost and timing of clinical trials  marketing and other expenses  and manufacturing or supply disruptions 
we recently expanded our internal manufacturing capacity for actiq at our salt lake city facility and plan to move production of actiq for the us market to our salt lake city facility beginning in the second quarter of in february  the fda approved our snda requesting this change 
manufacturing actiq for the us market at our salt lake city facility should allow us to benefit from efficiencies of scale and lead to lower cost of product sales for actiq in and beyond 
in  we completed private placements of million of convertible subordinated notes due may and million of convertible subordinated notes due december in march  we completed a private placement of million of convertible notes due march to acquire all of the joint venture interests of an unaffiliated third party investor 
the notes  notes and notes are convertible at the option of the holders into our common stock at per share conversion prices of  and  respectively 
the notes and notes also are redeemable by us at certain redemption prices beginning in may and december  respectively 
the holders of the notes  on march   can elect to require us to redeem all or part of the notes at a redemption price of of such principal amount redeemed 
in the future  we may agree to exchanges of the notes for shares of our common stock or may determine to use a portion of our existing cash on hand to purchase  redeem or retire all or a portion of the outstanding convertible notes 
as of december   there are million of convertible notes outstanding 
the annual interest payments on the outstanding balance of convertible notes are million payable at various dates throughout the year 
in early  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution in the aggregate notional amount of million 
under the swap  we agreed to pay a variable interest rate on million notional amount equal to libor bba 
currently in exchange for the financial institution s agreement to pay a fixed rate of 
as part of our business strategy  we plan to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies 
our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate these acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to raise substantial additional funds in the future to complete these transactions 
in addition  these acquisitions may result in significant charges to earnings for acquisition and related expenses that may include merger related costs or acquired in process research and development charges  among others 
on march   our wholly owned subsidiary formally commenced a cash takeover bid of a for each outstanding share of sirtex medical limited 
if our bid is successful  the total consideration for the outstanding sirtex shares will be approximately million  which will be funded using our existing cash balances 
to protect against fluctuations in the a us exchange rate during the bid period  in  we entered into a foreign currency exchange rate hedge that locked in the us dollar value of the bid 
if our bid is successful  we would expect to make a substantial investment in many aspects of sirtex s business  particularly in the areas of manufacturing  sales  marketing  and distribution 
based on our current level of operations and projected sales of our products combined with other revenues and interest income  we believe that we will be able to service our existing debt and meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the next several years 
however  we cannot be sure that our anticipated revenue growth will be realized or that we will continue to generate significant positive cash flow from operations 
we may need to obtain additional funding for our operational needs  to repay our outstanding indebtedness or for future significant strategic transactions  and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
certain risks related to our business you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report  before making an investment decision 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from us sales of our three largest products  and our future success will depend on the continued acceptance and growth of these products 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total worldwide net product sales were derived from sales of actiq  gabitril and provigil 
we cannot be certain that these products will continue to be accepted in their markets 
specifically  the following factors  among others  could affect the level of market acceptance of actiq  gabitril and provigil  including the perception of the healthcare community of their safety and efficacy  both in an absolute sense and relative to that of competing products  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts  unfavorable publicity regarding these products or similar products  product price relative to other competing drugs or treatments  changes in government and other third party payer reimbursement policies and practices  and regulatory developments affecting the manufacture  marketing or use of these products 
any material adverse developments with respect to the sale or use of actiq  gabitril and provigil could significantly reduce our product revenues and have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate net income and positive net cash flow from operations 
we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to expand the number and scope of authorized uses of provigil or gabitril  which would significantly hamper sales and earnings growth 
the market for the approved indications of two of our three largest products is relatively small 
analysis of prescription data indicates that a significant portion of our product sales is derived from the use of these products outside of their labeled indications 
as such  our future success depends on the expansion of the approved indications for provigil and gabitril 
we recently completed clinical studies with provigil and  in the fourth quarter of  submitted to the fda a snda for an expanded label 
while the clinical studies met their primary endpoints  we cannot be sure that we will succeed in obtaining fda approval to market provigil for a broader indication than that approved in its current label 
if the fda does not approve the snda it is not clear what impact this may have on physicians who currently prescribe provigil 
however  the absence of an expanded label will make it significantly more difficult to maintain or accelerate current rates of growth for provigil 
we also have initiated pilot studies to examine whether or not gabitril is effective and safe when used to treat disorders outside its currently approved use 
while the data received from the two pilot studies to date have generally been positive  we will need to conduct additional studies before we can apply to regulatory authorities to expand the authorized uses of this product 
we do not know whether these additional studies will demonstrate safety and efficacy  or if they do  whether we will succeed in receiving regulatory approval to market gabitril for additional disorders 
if the results of some of these additional studies are negative  this could undermine physician and patient comfort with the product  limit its commercial success  and diminish its acceptance 
even if the results of these studies are positive  the impact on sales of gabitril may be minimal unless we are able to obtain fda and foreign medical authority approval to expand the authorized uses of this product 
fda regulations limit our ability to communicate the results of additional clinical studies to patients and physicians without first obtaining regulatory approval for any expanded uses 
we may not be able to maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property or market exclusivity for certain of our products and therefore competitors may develop competing products  which could result in a decrease in sales and market share  cause us to reduce prices to compete successfully and limit our commercial success 
we place considerable importance on obtaining patent protection for new technologies  products and processes 
to that end  we file applications for patents covering the compositions or uses of our drug candidates or our proprietary processes 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
to date  there has emerged no consistent policy regarding breadth of claims in such companies patents 
accordingly  the patents and patent applications relating to our products  product candidates and technologies may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by third parties and might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technology 
patent disputes in our industry are frequent and can preclude commercialization of products 
if we ultimately engage in and lose any such disputes  we could be subject to competition or significant liabilities  we could be required to enter into third party licenses or we could be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute 
in addition  even if such licenses are available  the terms of any license requested by a third party could be unacceptable to us 
the us composition of matter patent for modafinil expired in we own us and foreign patent rights that expire between and covering pharmaceutical compositions of modafinil and  more specifically  covering certain particle sizes contained in this pharmaceutical composition 
ultimately  these patents might be found invalid if challenged by a third party  or a potential competitor could develop a competing product or product formulation that avoids infringement of these patents 
on february   we announced that the fda had accepted an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  for a pharmaceutical product containing modafinil 
any anda for modafinil filed with the fda prior to december must contain a paragraph iv certification in which the anda applicant certifies that the us particle size modafinil patent covering provigil either is invalid or will not be infringed by the anda product 
on march   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in us district court in new jersey against teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc  mylan pharmaceuticals inc  ranbaxy pharmaceuticals inc  and barr laboratories  inc 
based upon the andas filed by each of these companies with the fda 
the lawsuit claims infringement of our us patent no 
re while we intend to vigorously defend the validity of this patent and prevent infringement  these efforts will be both expensive and time consuming and  ultimately  may not be successful 
if an anda is approved ultimately  a competitor could begin selling a modafinil based product upon the expiration of our fda orphan drug exclusivity  currently in december  which would significantly and negatively impact revenues from provigil 
if we perform an additional clinical study of provigil in pediatric patients  the fda could grant us a six month extension of our orphan drug exclusivity to june and particle size patent 
however  we cannot be sure that the fda will grant such extension 
with respect to actiq  we hold an exclusive license to a us patent covering the currently approved pharmaceutical composition and methods for administering fentanyl via this composition that is set to expire in may we also hold patents to an fda approved compressed powder formulation that we expect to begin selling in the united states in the second quarter of these patents expire in september  though the fda could grant us a six month extension of these patents if we perform a clinical study in pediatric patients 
corresponding patents in foreign countries are set to expire between and the loss of patent protection on actiq  beginning in may in the united states  could significantly and negatively impact our revenues from the sale of actiq 
we also rely on trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advancements to support our competitive position 
although we have entered into confidentiality and invention rights agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators  these parties could fail to honor such agreements or we could be unable to effectively protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets and know how 
moreover  others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
in addition  many of our scientific and management personnel have been recruited from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies where they were conducting research in areas similar to those that we now pursue 
as a result  we could be subject to allegations of trade secret violations and other claims 
manufacturing  supply and distribution problems may create supply disruptions that could result in a reduction of product sales revenue  and damage commercial prospects for our products 
at our two manufacturing facilities in france  we produce the active drug substance modafinil and certain other commercial products 
at our us facility in salt lake city  utah  we manufacture actiq for international markets and  beginning in the second quarter of  for the united states 
for the remainder of our products  we solely rely on third parties for product manufacturing 
in all cases  we must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements of the fda and foreign authorities  including current good manufacturing practice regulations 
in addition  we must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements of the drug enforcement administration  and analogous foreign authorities for certain products 
the facilities used by us and third parties to manufacture  store and distribute our products are subject to inspection by regulatory authorities at any time to determine compliance with regulations 
these regulations are complex  and any failure to comply with them could lead to remedial action  civil and criminal penalties and delays in production or distribution of material 
we rely on third parties to distribute our products  perform customer service activities and accept and process product returns 
we also depend upon sole suppliers for active drug substances contained in our products  including our own french plant that manufactures modafinil  abbott laboratories to manufacture finished commercial supplies of gabitril for the us market and sanofi synthelabo to manufacture gabitril for us markets 
in the second quarter of  we expect to complete the transfer of all manufacturing of actiq for the us market from abbott to our salt lake city facility 
we have two qualified manufacturers  watson pharmaceuticals  in copiague  new york and dsm pharmaceuticals  in greenville  north carolina  for finished commercial supplies of provigil 
the process of changing or adding a manufacturer or changing a formulation requires prior fda and or european medical authority approval and is very time consuming 
if we are unable to manage this process effectively or if an unforeseen event occurs at any facility  we could face supply disruptions that would result in significant costs and delays  undermine goodwill established with physicians and patients  damage commercial prospects for our products and adversely affect operating results 
as our products are used commercially  unintended side effects  adverse reactions or incidents of misuse may occur that could result in additional regulatory controls and reduced sales of our products 
during research and development  the use of biopharmaceutical products  such as our products  is limited principally to clinical trial patients under controlled conditions and under the care of expert physicians 
the widespread commercial use of our products could produce undesirable or unintended side effects that have not been evident in our clinical trials or the relatively limited commercial use to date of our products 
in addition  in patients who take multiple medications  drug interactions could occur that can be difficult to predict 
additionally  incidents of product misuse may occur 
these events  among others  could result in additional regulatory controls that could limit the circumstances under which the product is prescribed or even lead to the withdrawal of the product from the market 
more specifically  actiq has been approved under regulations concerning drugs with certain safety profiles  under which the fda has established special restrictions to ensure safe use 
any violation of these special restrictions could lead to the imposition of further restrictions or withdrawal of the product from the market 
we face significant product liability risks  which may have a negative effect on our financial performance 
the administration of drugs to humans  whether in clinical trials or commercially  can result in product liability claims whether or not the drugs are actually at fault for causing an injury 
furthermore  our products may cause  or may appear to have caused  adverse side effects including death or potentially dangerous drug interactions that we may not learn about or understand fully until the drug has been administered to patients for some time 
as our products are used more widely and in patients with varying medical conditions  the likelihood of an adverse drug reaction  unintended side effect or incidence of misuse may increase 
product liability claims can be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments or settlements against us  which could have a negative effect on our financial performance 
the costs of product liability insurance have increased dramatically in recent years  and the availability of coverage has decreased 
nevertheless  we maintain product liability insurance in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable 
any claims could easily exceed our coverage limits 
even if a product liability claim is not successful  the adverse publicity and time and expense of defending such a claim may interfere with our business 
our activities and products are subject to significant government regulations and approvals  which are often costly and could result in adverse consequences to our business if we fail to comply 
we currently have a number of products that have been approved for sale in the united states  foreign countries or both 
all of our approved products are subject to extensive continuing regulations relating to  among other things  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling  and promotion 
the failure to comply with any rules and regulations of the fda or any foreign medical authority  or the post approval discovery of previously unknown problems relating to our products  could result in  among others fines  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspension of product sales  non approval of product license applications  restrictions on our ability to enter into strategic relationships  and criminal prosecution 
it is both costly and time consuming for us to comply with these regulations 
additionally  incidents of adverse drug reactions  unintended side effects or misuse relating to our products could result in additional regulatory controls or restrictions  or even lead to withdrawal of the product from the market 
with respect to our product candidates and for new therapeutic indications for our existing products  we conduct research  preclinical testing and clinical trials 
we cannot market these product candidates or these new indications in the united states or other countries without receiving approval from the fda or the appropriate foreign medical authority 
the approval process is highly uncertain and requires substantial time  effort and financial resources 
ultimately  we may never obtain approval in a timely manner  or at all 
without these required approvals  our ability to substantially grow revenues in the future could be adversely affected 
in addition  because provigil and actiq contain active ingredients that are controlled substances  we are subject to regulation by the dea and analogous foreign organizations relating to the manufacture  shipment  sale and use of the applicable products 
these regulations also are imposed on prescribing physicians and other third parties  making the storage  transport and use of such products relatively complicated and expensive 
with the increased concern for safety by the fda and the dea with respect to products containing controlled substances  it is possible that these regulatory agencies could impose additional restrictions on marketing or even withdrawal of regulatory approval for such products 
in addition  adverse publicity may bring about rejection of the product by the medical community 
if the dea  fda or a foreign medical authority withdrew the approval of  or placed additional significant restrictions on the marketing of any of our products  our product sales and ability to promote our products could be substantially affected 
our product sales and related financial results will fluctuate and these fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall  especially if investors do not anticipate them 
a number of analysts and investors who follow our stock have developed models to attempt to forecast future product sales and expenses and have established earnings expectations based upon those models 
these models  in turn  are based in part on estimates of projected revenue and earnings that we disclose publicly 
forecasting future revenues is difficult  especially when there is little commercial history and when the level of market acceptance of our products is uncertain 
forecasting is further complicated by the difficulties in estimating stocking levels at pharmaceutical wholesalers and at retail pharmacies  the timing of purchases by wholesalers and retailers to replenish stock and the frequency and amount of potential product returns 
as a result  it is likely that there will be significant fluctuations in revenues  which may not meet with market expectations and which also may adversely affect our stock price 
there are a number of other factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate unexpectedly  including the cost of product sales  achievement and timing of research and development milestones  collaboration revenues  cost and timing of clinical trials  marketing and other expenses  and manufacturing or supply disruptions 
we may be unable to service or repay our substantial indebtedness or other contingencies 
as of december   we had million of indebtedness outstanding  including million outstanding under convertible notes with a conversion price far in excess of our current stock price 
of the indebtedness outstanding  million matures in during we incurred interest expenses of million on our outstanding indebtedness 
these factors  among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on or refinance our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing in the future  or limit our future flexibility and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
unless we are able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  we will be required to raise additional funds 
because the financing markets may be unwilling to provide funding to us or may only be willing to provide funding on terms that we would consider unacceptable  we may not have cash available or be able to obtain funding to permit us to meet our debt service or repayment obligations  thus adversely affecting the market price for our securities 
the efforts of government entities and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care may adversely affect our sales and limit the commercial success of our products 
in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of pharmaceutical products is subject to various forms of direct and indirect governmental control  including the control over the amount of reimbursements provided to the patient who is prescribed specific pharmaceutical products 
for example  we are aware of government efforts in france to limit or eliminate reimbursement for certain of our products  which could impact revenues from our french operations 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  various proposals to implement similar controls 
the commercial success of our products could be limited if federal or state governments adopt any such proposals 
in addition  in the united states and elsewhere  sales of pharmaceutical products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payers  such as government and private insurance plans 
these third party payers increasingly challenge the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and seek to limit reimbursement levels offered to consumers for such products 
these third party payers could focus their cost control efforts on our products  especially with respect to prices of and reimbursement levels for products prescribed outside their labeled indications 
in these cases  their efforts could negatively impact our product sales and profitability 
we experience intense competition in our fields of interest  which may adversely affect our business 
large and small companies  academic institutions  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for product development in competition with us 
products developed by any of these entities may compete directly with those we develop or sell 
the conditions that our products treat  and some of the other disorders for which we are conducting additional studies  are currently treated with several drugs  many of which have been available for a number of years or are available in inexpensive generic forms 
with respect to provigil  there are several other products used for the treatment of narcolepsy in the united states  including methylphenidate products such as ritalin by novartis  and in our other territories  many of which have been available for a number of years and are available in inexpensive generic forms 
with respect to actiq  we face competition from inexpensive oral opioid tablets and more expensive but quick acting invasive ie  intravenous  intramuscular and subcutaneous opioid delivery systems 
other technologies for rapidly delivering opioids to treat breakthrough pain are being developed  at least one of which is in clinical trials 
with respect to gabitril  there are several products  including neurontin gabapentin by pfizer  used as adjunctive therapy for the partial seizure market 
some are well established therapies that have been on the market for several years while others have recently entered the partial seizure marketplace 
in addition  several treatments for partial seizures are available in inexpensive generic forms 
thus  we need to demonstrate to physicians  patients and third party payers that the cost of our products is reasonable and appropriate in the light of their safety and efficacy  the price of competing products and the related health care benefits to the patient 
in addition  many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we have  and substantially greater experience in conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
these entities represent significant competition for us 
in addition  competitors who are developing products for the treatment of neurological or oncological disorders might succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any that we develop or sell or that would render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive 
competition and innovation from these or other sources  including advances in current treatment methods  could potentially affect sales of our products negatively or make our products obsolete 
in addition  we may be at a competitive marketing disadvantage against companies that have broader product lines and whose sales personnel are able to offer more complementary products than we can 
any failure to maintain our competitive position could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we plan to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of technologies  products and businesses  which may subject us to a number of risks and or result in us experiencing significant charges to earnings that may adversely affect our stock price  operating results and financial condition 
we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses  products  product rights and technologies that are complementary to our business 
as part of that review  we conduct business  legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction 
despite our efforts  we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and  as a result  we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition 
we also must consolidate and integrate any acquired operations with our business 
these integration efforts often take a significant amount of time  place a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources and could prove to be more difficult and expensive than we predicted 
if we fail to realize the expected benefits from an acquisition  whether as a result of unidentified risks  integration difficulties or otherwise  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  as a result of acquiring businesses or entering into other significant transactions  we have experienced  and will likely continue to experience  significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses that may include transaction costs  closure costs or acquired in process research and development charges 
these costs may include substantial fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other advisers  as well as severance and other closure costs associated with the elimination of duplicate operations and facilities 
our incurrence of these charges could adversely affect our results of operations for particular quarterly or annual periods 
the results and timing of our research and development activities  including future clinical trials are difficult to predict  subject to potential future setbacks and  ultimately  may not result in viable pharmaceutical products  which may adversely affect our business 
in order to sustain our business  we focus substantial resources on the search for new pharmaceutical products 
these activities include engaging in discovery research and process development  conducting preclinical and clinical studies and seeking regulatory approval in the united states and abroad 
in all of these areas  we have relatively limited resources and compete against larger  multinational pharmaceutical companies 
moreover  even if we undertake these activities in an effective and efficient manner  regulatory approval for the sale of new pharmaceutical products remains highly uncertain because the majority of compounds discovered do not enter clinical studies and the majority of therapeutic candidates fail to show the human safety and efficacy necessary for regulatory approval and successful commercialization 
preclinical testing and clinical trials must demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and efficacious 
the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in subsequent clinical trials  and these clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy necessary to obtain regulatory approval for any product candidates 
a number of companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
for ethical reasons  certain clinical trials are conducted in patients having the most advanced stages of disease and who have failed treatment with alternative therapies 
during the course of treatment  these patients often die or suffer other adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agent being tested 
such events can have a negative impact on the statistical analysis of clinical trial results 
the completion of clinical trials of our product candidates may be delayed by many factors  including the rate of enrollment of patients 
neither we nor our collaborators can control the rate at which patients present themselves for enrollment  and the rate of patient enrollment may not be consistent with our expectations or sufficient to enable clinical trials of our product candidates to be completed in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  we may not be permitted by regulatory authorities to undertake additional clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates 
even if such trials are conducted  our product candidates may not prove to be safe and efficacious or receive regulatory approvals 
any significant delays in  or termination of  clinical trials of our product candidates could impact our ability to generate product sales from these product candidates in the future 
our research and development and marketing efforts are often dependent on corporate collaborators and other third parties who may not devote sufficient time  resources and attention to our programs  and which may limit our efforts to develop and market potential products 
because we have limited resources  we have entered into a number of collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical companies  including lundbeck with respect to our research efforts in parkinson s disease  and with a number of marketing partners for our products in certain countries outside the united states 
in some cases  our collaboration agreements call for our partners to control the supply of bulk or formulated drugs for use in clinical trials or for commercial use  the design and execution of clinical studies  the process of obtaining regulatory approval to market the product  and or marketing and selling of any approved product 
in each of these areas  our partners may not support fully our research and commercial interests because our program may compete for time  attention and resources with the internal programs of our corporate collaborators 
as such  our program may not move forward as effectively  or advance as rapidly  as it might if we had retained complete control of all research  development  regulatory and commercialization decisions 
we also rely on some of these collaborators and other third parties for the production of compounds and the manufacture and supply of pharmaceutical products 
additionally  we may find it necessary from time to time to seek new or additional partners to assist us in commercializing our products  though we might not be successful in establishing any such new or additional relationships 
the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile  and we expect it to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future 
for example  from january  through march   our common stock traded at a high price of and a low price of 
negative announcements  including  among others adverse regulatory decisions  disappointing clinical trial results  disputes and other developments concerning patent or other proprietary rights with respect to our products  or operating results that fall below the market s expectations could trigger significant declines in the price of our common stock 
in addition  external events  such as news concerning economic conditions  our competitors  changes in government regulations impacting the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries or the movement of capital into or out of our industry  also are likely to affect the price of our common stock 
a portion of our product sales and certain balance sheet items are subject to exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business that could adversely affect our reported results of operations 
historically  a portion of our product sales has been earned in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result of our acquisition of group lafon  the portion of our product sales denominated in the euro and other local currencies has and may continue to increase 
for the year ended december   approximately of our product sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we translate revenue earned from product sales into us dollars at the average exchange rate applicable during the relevant period 
a strengthening of the us dollar would  therefore  reduce our earnings 
consequently  fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the euro and other currencies may affect period to period comparisons of our operating results 
finally  the balance sheet of our foreign operations will be translated into us dollars at the period end exchange rate 
this latter exposure will result in changes to the translated value of assets and liabilities  with the impact of the translation included as a component of stockholders equity 
historically  we have not hedged our exposure to these fluctuations in exchange rates 
we are involved  or may become involved in the future  in legal proceedings that  if adversely adjudicated or settled  could materially impact our financial condition 
as a biopharmaceutical company  we are or may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business  including  among others  matters alleging employment discrimination  product liability  patent or other intellectual property rights infringement  patent invalidity or breach of commercial contract 
in general  litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact results of operations and financial condition 
we currently are vigorously defending ourselves against certain litigation matters 
while we currently do not believe that the settlement or adverse adjudication of these lawsuits would materially impact our results of operations or financial condition  the final resolution of these matters and the impact  if any  on our results of operations or financial condition could be material 
our customer base is highly concentrated 
our principal customers are wholesale drug distributors 
these customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the united states 
a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market 
for the year ended december   our three largest us wholesaler customers were cardinal health  inc  mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation 
these three distributors  in the aggregate  accounted for of our total gross product sales 
the loss or bankruptcy of any of these customers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our dependence on key executives and scientists could impact the development and management of our business 
we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development and management of our business 
although we do not believe the loss of one individual would materially harm our business  our research and development programs and our business might be harmed by the loss of the services of multiple existing personnel  as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific  technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner 
much of the know how we have developed resides in our scientific and technical personnel and is not readily transferable to other personnel 
while we have employment agreements with our key executives  we do not ordinarily enter into employment agreements with our other key scientific  technical and managerial employees 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations  and our related compliance may limit any future profitability 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous  infectious and radioactive materials that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment 
we store these materials  and various wastes resulting from their use  at our facilities pending ultimate use and disposal 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and wastes  and we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with related existing and future environmental laws and regulations 
while we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages  which could include fines and remedial costs 
these damages could require payment by us of significant amounts over a number of years  which would be reflected in our results of operations and financial condition 
anti takeover provisions may delay or prevent changes in control of our management or deter a third party from acquiring us  limiting our stockholders ability to profit from such a transaction 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  par value  of which  have been reserved for issuance in connection with our stockholder rights plan  and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
our stockholder rights plan could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person becomes an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the application of section could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of cephalon 
section  the rights plan  and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware corporate law  may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers  or delaying or preventing changes in control of our management  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk at december   we did not hold any derivative financial instruments and did not engage in any speculative or derivative trading activities 
therefore  our market risk exposure is limited to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio  since all of our outstanding debt is fixed rate 
our investments are classified as short term and as available for sale 
we do not believe that short term fluctuations in interest rates would materially affect the value of our securities 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our operations in european subsidiaries that have transactions  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting purposes 
historically  we have not hedged any of these foreign currency exchange risks 
for the year ended december   an average strengthening of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which our european subsidiaries operate would have resulted in a decrease in reported net sales of million and a decrease in reported net income of million for that period 
this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not assume any changes in the level of operations of our european subsidiaries
