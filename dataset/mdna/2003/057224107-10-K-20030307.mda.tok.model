baker hughes expectations regarding its business outlook  customer spending  oil and gas prices and the business environment for the company and the industry in general are only its forecasts regarding these matters 
these forecasts may be substantially different from actual results  which are affected by the following risk factors the level of petroleum industry exploration and production expenditures  drilling rig and oil and gas industry manpower and equipment availability  the company s ability to implement and effect price increases for its products and services  the company s ability to control its costs  the availability of sufficient manufacturing capacity and subcontracting capacity at forecasted costs to meet the company s revenue goals  the ability of the company to introduce new technology on its forecasted schedule and at its forecasted cost  the ability of the company s competitors to capture market share  the company s ability to retain or increase its market share  the company s completion of its proposed west africa disposition  world economic conditions  the price of  and the demand for  crude oil and natural gas  drilling activity  weather conditions that affect the demand for energy and severe weather conditions that affect exploration and production activities  the legislative and regulatory environment in the us and other countries in which the company operates  organization of petroleum exporting countries opec policy and the adherence by opec nations to their opec production quotas  war or extended period of international conflict involving the us  the middle east and other major petroleum producing or consuming regions  acts of war or terrorism  civil unrest or in country security concerns where the company operates  the development of technology by baker hughes or its competitors that lowers overall finding and development costs  new laws and regulations that could have a significant impact on the future operations and conduct of all businesses as a result of the financial deterioration and bankruptcies of large us entities  labor related actions  including strikes  slowdowns and facility occupations  the condition of the capital and equity markets in general  adverse foreign exchange fluctuations and adverse changes in the capital markets in international locations where the company operates  and the timing of any of the foregoing 
see business environment for a more detailed discussion of certain of these risk factors 
baker hughes expectations regarding its level of capital expenditures described in liquidity and capital resources below are only its forecasts regarding these matters 
in addition to the factors described in the previous paragraph and in business environment  these forecasts may be substantially different from actual results  which are affected by the following factors the accuracy of the company s estimates regarding its spending requirements  regulatory  legal and contractual impediments to spending reduction measures  the occurrence of any unanticipated acquisition or research and development opportunities  changes in the company s strategic direction  and the need to replace any unanticipated losses in capital assets 
business environment the company currently has seven operating divisions each with separate management teams that are engaged in the oilfield services and continuous process industries 
the divisions have been aggregated into two reportable segments oilfield and process 
the oilfield segment consists of six operating divisions baker atlas  baker oil tools  baker petrolite  centrilift  hughes christensen and inteq that manufacture and sell products and provide services used in the oil and gas exploration industry  including drilling  formation evaluation  completion and production of oil and gas wells 
the oilfield segment also includes the company s investment in the westerngeco venture 
for the year ended december   revenues from the oilfield segment accounted for of total revenues 
the process segment consists of one operating division  bird machine  and the company s investment in the petreco venture 
bird machine manufactures and sells a broad range of continuous and batch centrifuges and specialty filters for separating  dewatering or classifying process and waste streams 
the business environment for the company s oilfield segment and its corresponding operating results can be significantly affected by the level of energy industry capital expenditures for the exploration and production e p of oil and gas reserves 
these expenditures are influenced strongly by expectations about the supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas products and by the energy price environment 
the company does business in approximately countries 
according to transparency international s annual corruption perceptions index cpi survey  a high degree of corruption is perceived to exist in many of these countries 
for example  the company does business in about one half of the countries having the worst scores in transparency international s cpi survey for the company devotes significant resources to the development  maintenance and enforcement of its business code of conduct policy  its foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa policy  its internal control processes and procedures  as well as other compliance related policies 
notwithstanding the devotion of such resources  and in part as a consequence thereof  the company  from time to time  discovers or receives information alleging potential violations of the fcpa and the company s policies  processes and procedures 
the company conducts internal investigations of these potential violations 
the company anticipates that the devotion of significant resources to compliance related issues  including the necessity for such internal investigations  will continue to be an aspect of doing business in a number of the countries in which oil and gas exploration  development and production take place and the company is requested to conduct operations 
key risk factors currently influencing the worldwide crude oil and gas markets are production control the degree to which individual opec nations and other large oil and gas producing countries  including  but not limited to  mexico  norway and russia  are willing and able to control production and exports of crude oil to decrease or increase supply and support their targeted oil price while meeting their market share objectives 
key measures of production control include actual production levels compared with target or quota production levels  oil price compared with targeted oil price and changes in each country s market share 
global economic growth particularly the impact of the us and western european economies and the economic activity in japan  china  south korea and the developing areas of asia where the correlation between energy demand and economic growth is strong 
an important factor in the global economic growth in will be the strength and timing of a us economic recovery 
key measures include us and global economic activity  global energy demand and forecasts of future demand by governments and private organizations 
oil and gas storage inventory levels a measure of the balance between supply and demand 
a key measure of us natural gas inventories is the storage level reported weekly by the us department of energy compared with historic levels 
key measures for oil inventories include us inventory levels reported by the us department of energy and american petroleum institute and worldwide estimates reported by the international energy agency  again compared with historic levels 
ability to produce natural gas the amount of natural gas that can be produced is a function of the number of new wells drilled  completed and connected to pipelines as well as the rate of reservoir depletion and production from existing wells 
advanced technologies  such as horizontal drilling  result in improved total recovery  but also result in a more rapid production decline 
technological progress in the design and application of new products that allow oil and gas companies to drill fewer wells and to drill  complete and produce wells faster  recover more hydrocarbons and to do so at lower cost 
also key are the overall levels of research and engineering spending and the pace at which new technology is introduced commercially and accepted by customers 
maturity of the resource base of known hydrocarbon reserves in the north sea  us  canada and latin america 
pace of new investment access to capital and the reinvestment of available cash flow into existing and emerging markets 
key measures of access to capital include cash flow  interest rates  analysis of oil and gas company leverage and equity offering activity 
access to capital is particularly important for smaller independent oil and gas companies 
energy prices and price volatility the impact of widely fluctuating commodity prices on the stability of the market and subsequent impact on customer spending 
sustained higher energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth 
while current energy prices are important contributors to positive cash flow at e p companies  expectations for future prices are more important for determining future e p spending 
possible supply disruptions from key oil exporting countries  including but not limited to  iraq  saudi arabia and other middle eastern countries and venezuela  due to political instability or military activity 
in addition  adverse weather such as hurricanes could impact production facilities  causing supply disruptions 
weather the impact of variations in temperatures as compared with normal weather patterns and the related effect on demand for oil and natural gas 
a key measure of the impact of weather on energy demand is population weighted heating and cooling degree days as reported by the us department of energy and forecasts of warmer than normal or cooler than normal temperatures 
oil and gas prices generally  customers expectations about their prospects from oil and gas sales and customers expenditures to explore for or produce oil and gas rise or fall with corresponding changes in the prices of oil or gas 
accordingly  changes in these expenditures will normally result in increased or decreased demand for the company s products and services in its oilfield segment 
west texas intermediate wti crude oil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated 
wti crude oil bbl us spot natural gas mmbtu wti crude oil prices averaged bbl in  rising from a low of bbl in january to a high of bbl in december 
production cuts by both opec and non opec producers late in were carried into the beginning of and averted a substantial price decline driven by rising inventories early in the year 
over the course of the year  however  oil prices rose above what the historical relationship between prices and inventories would suggest was appropriate  driven primarily by concerns of a possible supply disruption resulting from a military campaign in iraq 
this war premium fluctuated in a range estimated to be between bbl to bbl for the first three quarters of in the fourth quarter  prices softened briefly on concerns the market would be oversupplied due to rising opec production rates before strengthening again in december on renewed supply concerns amidst a general strike in venezuela and ongoing uncertainty regarding the possibility of a military conflict in iraq 
during  natural gas prices averaged mmbtu 
while lower than the average of mmbtu  prices generally rose over the course of  similar to oil prices 
from a low of mmbtu in january  prices rose as high as mmbtu in december 
the rise in natural gas prices over the course of the year was driven primarily by tightening supply 
the year over year gas storage surplus continued its decline from a december peak 
the first week of november marked the start of the withdrawal season  some five weeks earlier than in  as well as the first time storage levels showed a year over year deficit since may this tightening of the gas market was driven primarily by accelerating declines in gas production as north american drilling activity in trended downward to be well below levels 
rig counts the company is engaged in the oilfield service industry providing products and services that are used in exploring for  developing and producing oil and gas reservoirs 
when drilling or workover rigs are active  they consume many of the products and services provided by the oilfield service industry 
the rig counts act as a leading indicator of consumption of products and services used in drilling  completing  producing and processing hydrocarbons 
rig count trends are governed by the exploration and development spending by oil and gas companies  which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas 
rig counts therefore generally reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices 
the company has been providing rig counts to the public since the company gathers all relevant data through its field service personnel worldwide who routinely visit the various rigs operating in their areas 
this data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on the company s website 
rig counts are compiled weekly for the us and canada and monthly for all international and workover rigs 
north american rigs are counted as active if the well being drilled has been started and drilling has not been completed on the day the count is taken 
for an international rig to be counted as active on a monthly basis  drilling operations must comprise at least days during the month 
published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in russia or china because this information is extremely difficult to obtain 
the company s rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated 
us land  us offshore canada north america    latin america north sea other europe africa middle east asia pacific outside north america worldwide    us workover rigs    industry outlook caution is advised that the factors described above in forward looking statements and business environment could negatively impact the company s expectations for oil and gas demand  oil and gas prices and drilling activity 
oil the balance between oil supply and oil demand is tight as begins 
the ongoing turmoil in venezuela has disrupted supplies and resulted in extremely low oil inventory levels in the us opec has decided to increase production to offset the loss of approximately million barrels per day of venezuelan production  however  crude oil from the middle east generally takes over one month to arrive in the us due to longer transit times 
complicating the situation is the uncertainty associated with the possibility and timing of military action in the middle east and any additional disruptions in supply 
as a result  oil prices are expected to average between bbl and bbl in the first quarter of in  prices could trade in a much broader range depending on the nature  duration and outcome of any potential military action in iraq  the duration and resolution of the strike in venezuela  the willingness and the ability of opec nations and other key nations to manage production levels to stabilize prices and the pace of worldwide economic activity 
north america natural gas in  prices are expected to trade between mmbtu and mmbtu 
natural gas could trade at the top of this range in if weather is colder than expected  if the us economy  particularly the industrial sector  exhibits growth and if continued levels of customer spending result in further natural gas production declines 
prices could move to the bottom of this range if the us economic recovery is delayed or weaker than expected or if weather is milder than expected 
customer spending based upon the company s discussions with its major customers  its review of published industry reports and the company s outlook for oil and gas prices described above  the anticipated customer spending trends are as follows north america spending in north america  primarily towards developing natural gas supplies  is expected to increase approximately to in compared with outside north america customer spending  primarily directed at developing oil supplies  is expected to be flat to up by in compared with total spending is expected to be up to in compared with drilling activity based upon the company s outlooks for oil and natural gas prices and customer spending described above  the company s outlook for drilling activity  as measured by the baker hughes rig count  is as follows the north american rig count is expected to increase approximately to in compared with the us rig count is expected to rise throughout the year and end the year at approximately to  rigs 
drilling activity outside of north america  excluding venezuela  is expected to remain steady in and is expected to increase as much as to compared with company outlook the company expects that will be stronger than  with revenues expected to increase by approximately to as compared with  with related improvements in operating results  primarily in the second half of the year 
activity is expected to improve in the second half of as a result of increased drilling activity in the us  primarily due to relatively higher commodity prices 
activity outside of the us is also expected to increase as a result of the relatively high crude oil prices 
the company expects the first quarter of activity to be down compared with the fourth quarter of due to the impact of reduced business activity levels in venezuela  reduced export sales and downward pricing pressures on the company s products and services 
on december   pdvsa  the national oil company of venezuela  initiated a strike intended to force venezuelan president hugo chavez to resign from office and call new elections 
the strike effectively shut down activity in the venezuelan energy industry and led to a general strike which had a severe impact on the venezuelan economy 
by the end of december  exploration and development activity was at less than of its pre strike levels 
the nature and timing of a resolution is uncertain 
even if there is a quick resolution to the crisis  it is expected to take several months for activity levels in venezuela to return to normal 
the company has implemented a cost reduction effort in venezuela and has reduced new investments of capital in the country 
the strike has significantly impacted the company s venezuelan operations and it is expected to have a lingering impact after it is resolved until activity returns to pre strike levels 
revenues for venezuela for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
at december  and  net property in venezuela totaled million and million  respectively 
in argentina  the weakening peso and related economic issues did not materially impact the company s business during this impact did  however  include devaluation losses  delays and losses associated with collecting outstanding accounts receivable and reduced demand for the company s products and services 
although the economic environment had stabilized by the end of  there could be additional losses if there were to be additional currency devaluations or if the company s customers encounter additional financial difficulty  thereby impacting their ability to pay amounts due to the company 
in addition  the economic environment in argentina will likely continue to negatively impact the exploration and production spending plans of the company s customers for the company has responded to this situation in a number of ways  including renegotiating with its customers for acceptable payment terms  increasing the use of us dollar based invoicing or us dollar equivalent pricing and invoicing  adjusting pricing and contracts to reflect the changes in argentina s currency and shipping products to argentina directly from outside the country with payment made offshore in us dollars or equivalent currency 
at december   net property in argentina totaled million 
revenues for argentina for the year ended december  totaled million 
aspects of the us iraqi conflict and the war on terrorism are likely to have an impact on results 
currently  expectations of military activity and potential supply disruptions have resulted in a war premium for crude oil and strong cash flows for our customers 
should military action take place and be resolved quickly  resulting in an increase in oil production from iraq  oil prices could fall significantly 
however  should military action not be resolved quickly  resulting in extended supply disruptions  oil prices could be sustained at higher prices 
the company cannot predict the extent of the impact that any such events may have on the company 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions and information that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty and accordingly  these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as the company s operating environment changes 
the company has defined a critical accounting policy as one that is both important to the understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires the management of the company to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting polices used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements as well as the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies 
revenue recognition inherent in the company s revenue recognition policy is the determination of the collectibility of amounts due from its customers  which requires the company to use estimates and exercise judgment 
the company routinely monitors its customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectibility is reasonably assured 
this requires the company to make frequent judgments and estimates in order to determine the appropriate period to recognize a sale to a customer and the amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts 
the company records provisions for doubtful accounts when it becomes evident that the customer will not be able to make the required payments either at contractual due dates or in the future 
changes in the financial condition of the company s customers  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required 
inventories the company s inventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records provisions for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on its estimated forecast of product demand  market conditions  production requirements and technological developments 
significant or unanticipated changes to the company s forecasts of these items  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory that may be required 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  goodwill  intangible assets and certain other assets  comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
income taxes the company uses the liability method for determining income taxes  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowances  changes in these estimates and assumptions could require the company to adjust the valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets 
the company operates in more than countries under many legal forms 
as a result  the company is subject to numerous domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions and tax agreements and treaties among the various taxing authorities 
the company s operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases income before taxes  deemed profits which is generally determined using a percentage of revenues rather than profits and withholding taxes based on revenue 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that the company provides during any given year 
the company s and its subsidiaries tax filings for various periods are subjected to audit by tax authorities in most jurisdictions where they conduct business 
these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts 
the company believes that these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of local tax law 
in these situations  the company provides only for the amounts the company believes will ultimately result from these proceedings 
westerngeco on november   the company and schlumberger and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of schlumberger created a venture by transferring the seismic fleets  data processing assets  exclusive and nonexclusive multiclient surveys and other assets of the company s western geophysical division and schlumberger s geco prakla business unit 
the venture operates under the name of westerngeco 
the company and schlumberger own and of the venture  respectively 
the company accounts for this investment using the equity method of accounting 
in conjunction with the transaction  the company received million in cash from schlumberger in exchange for the transfer of a portion of the company s ownership in westerngeco 
the company also contributed million in working capital to westerngeco 
the company did not recognize any gain or loss resulting from the initial formation of the venture due to the company s material continued involvement in the operations of westerngeco 
in addition  as soon as practicable after november   the company or schlumberger will make a cash true up payment to the other party based on a formula comparing the ratio of the net present value of sales revenue from each party s contributed multiclient seismic libraries during the four year period ending november  and the ratio of the net book value of those libraries as of november  the maximum payment that either party will be required to make as a result of this adjustment is million 
in the event that future sales from the contributed libraries continue in the same relative percentages incurred through december   any payment made by either party is not expected to be significant 
any payment to be received or paid by the company will be recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of its investment in westerngeco 
summarized financial information for western geophysical for the eleven months ended november   the effective date of the close  included in the company s consolidated financial statements is as follows for the year ended december in millions revenues income before income taxes expenditures for capital assets and multiclient seismic data includes restructuring charges and corporate allocations excluding interest 
discontinued operations in november  the company sold eimco process equipment eimco  a division of the process segment  and received total proceeds of million  of which million is held in escrow pending completion of final adjustments of the purchase price 
in december  the company entered into exclusive negotiations for the sale of the company s interest in its oil producing operations in west africa and received million as a deposit 
the sale is subject to the execution of a definitive sale agreement and is expected to close in the first quarter of in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company has reclassified the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods to present both of these operations as discontinued 
summarized financial information from discontinued operations is as follows for the years ended december in millions revenues eimco oil producing operations total income loss before income taxes eimco oil producing operations total income taxes eimco oil producing operations total income loss before loss on disposal eimco oil producing operations total loss on disposal of eimco loss on write down to fair value  net of tax of recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments in earnings income loss from discontinued operations results of operations the company is engaged primarily in the oilfield service industry  which accounted for  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
as a result  the discussion regarding the consolidated results of operations is primarily focused on the company s oilfield segment 
revenues revenues for were  million  a decrease of compared with oilfield revenues were  million  a decrease of compared with oilfield revenues in north america  which accounted for of total oilfield revenues  decreased compared with this decrease reflects lower activity in the us land and offshore operations and canada  as evidenced by a decrease in the north american rig count 
inclement weather in the gulf of mexico  including tropical storm isidore and hurricane lili  also contributed to the decline 
outside north america  oilfield revenues increased compared with this increase reflects the improvement in international drilling activity  particularly in the middle east and asia pacific  partially offset by weaker revenues in latin america due to the political and economic environments in argentina and venezuela and the impact of a labor strike in norway 
revenues for were  million  an increase of compared with oilfield revenues were  million  an increase of compared with oilfield revenues in north america  which accounted for of total oilfield revenues  increased compared with this increase reflects the increased drilling activity in this area  as evidenced by a increase in the north american rig count  and improved pricing for the company s products and services 
outside north america  oilfield revenues increased compared with this increase reflects the improvement in international drilling activity  particularly in the north sea  latin america and the middle east 
gross margin gross margin was  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin for compared with is the result of the company s current strategy not to significantly reduce its work force to match current activity levels  pricing pressures and a change in the geographic and product mix from the sale of the company s products and services

sg a expenses for were million  an increase of compared with sg a expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for and were and  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to increased costs to support the higher revenue level  increased employee incentive costs and decreased foreign exchange gains 
restructuring charges restructuring charges are comprised of the following for the years ended december in millions german operations of bird machine oil and gas exploration business westerngeco formation seismic operations and other restructuring charges german operations of bird machine in  the company initiated a restructuring of its german operations of bird machine  a division of the process segment 
the restructuring consisted of downsizing its german operations from a full manufacturing facility to an assembly and repair facility 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of million relating to severance for approximately employees 
the company terminated employees and paid million of accrued severance 
the remaining accrual of million was reversed during the second quarter of due to unanticipated voluntary terminations and more favorable separation payments than had been originally estimated 
oil and gas exploration business in october  the company s board of directors approved the company s plan to substantially exit the oil and gas exploration business 
the company s oil and gas exploration business included various small producing working interests and undeveloped properties around the world and a working interest in west africa that accounted for substantially all of the company s revenue from oil and gas operations  which interest is now reflected as a discontinued operation 
the company had determined that future capital requirements were more than the company was willing to commit and that this business was not consistent with its long term plans 
as a result  the company recorded restructuring charges of million  consisting of million of severance  million for costs to settle contractual obligations and a million loss for the write off of the company s undeveloped exploration properties in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the severance charges were for approximately employees  of which employees have been terminated as of december  the company has paid million of this accrued severance through based on current estimates  the company expects that the remainder of the accrued severance will be paid during or as the employees leave the company

this consisted of compensation cost of million for stock options retained by certain employees who became employees of westerngeco and million for vacation costs accrued as part of its agreement with the company s venture partner 
the compensation cost of the options was measured using the intrinsic value method 
seismic operations and other in october  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million related to the downsizing of its seismic operations 
during the ensuing six months  the seismic industry continued to deteriorate  resulting in further consolidations in the industry 
in may  the company announced the formation of westerngeco 
as a result of this venture formation  the original restructuring plan was modified  which resulted in a million reversal of the original charge 
such reversal included million from the retention by the venture of approximately employees that had been identified for termination and lower than expected moving and derigging costs of certain marine vessels 
the reversal also included million related to the company s successful negotiation of more favorable terms related to the final termination of marine vessel leases during may and june the reversals in also included million  which primarily related to a million recovery from a receivable written off as a restructuring charge in and million from favorable settlements related to litigation originally accrued for as restructuring charges in and gain loss on disposal of assets during  the company recognized a gain of million on the disposition of its interest in a joint venture within the oilfield segment and received net proceeds of million from this transaction

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in the company s financial instruments that arise in the normal course of business 
the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
long term debt the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed interest rate debt 
commercial paper borrowings  other short term borrowings and variable rate long term debt do not give rise to significant interest rate risk because these borrowings either have maturities of less than three months or have variable interest rates 
all other things being equal  the fair market value of the company s debt with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall and will decrease as interest rates rise 
this exposure to interest rate risk is managed by borrowing money that has a variable interest rate or using interest rate swaps to change fixed interest rate borrowings to variable interest rate borrowings 
at december   the company had fixed rate debt aggregating  million and variable rate debt aggregating million 
the following table sets forth  as of december  and  the company s principal cash flow requirements for its long term debt obligations  which bear a fixed rate of interest and are denominated in us dollars  and the related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates 
additionally  the table sets forth the notional amounts and weighted average effective interest rates of the company s interest rate swaps by expected maturity dollar amounts in millions 
thereafter total as of december  long term debt   weighted average effective interest rates as of december  long term debt   weighted average effective interest rates fixed to variable swaps notional amount pay rate receive rate fair market value of long term debt was  million at december  and  million at december  fair market value of the interest rate swaps was a million asset at december  three month libor plus 
average six month libor for the japanese yen  the euro and the swiss franc plus 
interest rate swap agreements the company had two interest rate swap agreements that had been designated and had qualified as fair value hedging instruments 
due to the company s outlook for interest rates  the company terminated the two agreements and received payments totaling million upon cancellation in the deferred gains of million and million on the agreements are being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining lives of the underlying debt securities  which mature in june and january  respectively 
crude oil contracts during the year ended december   the company entered into two crude oil contracts to mitigate price risk associated with production from the company s interest in an oil producing property in west africa

foreign currency and foreign currency forward contracts the company s operations are conducted around the world in a number of different currencies 
the majority of the company s significant foreign subsidiaries have designated the local currency as their functional currency 
as such  future earnings are subject to change due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than the company s functional currencies 
to minimize the need for foreign currency contracts  the company s objective is to manage its foreign currency exposure by maintaining a minimal consolidated net asset or net liability position in a currency other than the functional currency 
at december   the company had entered into a foreign currency hedge with a notional amount of million to hedge exposure to fluctuations in the british pound sterling 
the contract is a cash flow hedge 
based on year end quoted market prices for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates  no asset or liability was recorded as the forward price was substantially the same as the contract price 
at december   the company had entered into foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of million  million and million to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the canadian dollar  the indonesian rupiah and the euro  respectively 
these contracts were cash flow hedges 
based on year end quoted market prices for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates  no asset or liability was recorded as the forward prices were substantially the same as the contract prices 
the counterparties to the company s forward contracts are major financial institutions 
the credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis 
in the unlikely event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract  the company s exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential
