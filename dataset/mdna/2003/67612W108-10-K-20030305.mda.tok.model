on june   odysseyre sold  shares of its common stock in an initial public offering 
in connection with this offering  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of odyssey america from subsidiaries of fairfax  our ultimate majority shareholder  for an aggregate consideration of million  consisting of million in cash  a million term note and million shares of our common stock 
the acquisition has been accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to a pooling of interests 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements of odyssey america and its subsidiaries have become our historical financial information 
on september   we acquired of the common stock of first capital insurance ltd  a singapore insurance company  for consideration of million 
through our operating subsidiaries  principally odyssey america  we are a leading united states based underwriter of reinsurance  providing a full range of property and casualty products on a worldwide basis 
we offer a broad range of both treaty and facultative reinsurance to property and casualty insurers and reinsurers 
treaty reinsurance involves the reinsurance of a specific line or class of business for an insurance company pursuant to an agreement or treaty 
facultative reinsurance involves the reinsurance of a specific policy as opposed to a line or class of business 
we also write specialty and non traditional lines of reinsurance  including professional liability  marine and aerospace 
throughout  we experienced growth opportunities in a number of areas  evidenced by our increase in gross premiums written of million  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  as a result of improved market conditions  including improved pricing and industry consolidation  and a series of catastrophic events  both in the united states and globally  conditions for us have been improving and we have opportunistically expanded in certain classes of business and in each of our geographic business segments 
our non united states operations  including newline  accounted for of our premium volume for due to the improved pricing environment and our continued focus on underwriting discipline  our underwriting results have significantly improved 
our combined ratio was for the year ended december   a decrease of percentage points from the combined ratio for the year ended december   which includes the effects of the terrorist attack of september th event of september th and the bankruptcy filing of enron corporation enron 
excluding these events  our combined ratio for the year ended december  improved by percentage points to from the reported for the year ended december  this improvement is a direct result of our underwriting actions  including improvements in pricing as well as terms and conditions  and our opportunistic expansion into better performing lines of business 
through a review of our reinsurance contracts  we have evaluated and estimated our exposure arising from the event of september th 
our estimate is based on the most recent information available 
our initial estimate  established in  appears to be appropriate  accordingly  such estimate has not been revised during the year ended december  as additional information becomes available  such estimate could be revised 
included in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december   is a net pre tax loss of million 
the after tax loss  assuming a tax rate  is million 
considerable time may elapse before the adequacy of our estimates can be determined 
with respect to the ceded underwriting loss  the reinsurance recoverable is with highly rated reinsurers and we do not foresee any potential credit risks 
we operate our business through three divisions  the americas  london market and euroasia  which are based principally on geographic regions 
the americas is our largest division  accounting for billion  or  of our gross premiums written for the year ended december   as compared to million  or  of our gross premiums written for the year ended december  the americas division writes treaty  both casualty and 
table of contents property  and facultative casualty reinsurance in the united states and canada  and treaty and facultative reinsurance in central and south america  as well as primary business in the united states through hudson  our insurance subsidiary 
the americas division is comprised of three units  the united states  canada  and latin america  with seven offices  located in stamford  two offices in new york city  mexico city  miami  santiago and toronto 
gross premiums written by the united states unit for the year ended december  were billion  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  gross premiums written by the latin american unit for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the canadian unit had gross premiums written of million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increases are due mainly to increased pricing both at the insurance and reinsurance levels 
the london branch unit business underwritten prior to had gross premiums written of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to million for the year ended december  business previously written by the london branch unit is being written through the london market division 
the london market division is comprised of our lloyd s of london business  in which we participate through our ownership of newline which in turn owns and manages syndicate  and our london branch office 
our lloyd s membership provides strong brand recognition  extensive broker and direct distribution channels and worldwide licensing  including the ability to write primary business on an excess and surplus basis in the united states 
the london market writes reinsurance and insurance business worldwide through brokers  generating million  or  of our gross premiums written for the year ended december  as compared to million  or  of our gross premiums written for the year ended december  the increase in gross premiums written of million  or  was mainly in financial lines  marine and aerospace and international casualty business 
the euroasia division was formed in as part of the realignment of our business across geographic regions 
euroasia operates out of four offices  with principal offices in paris and singapore 
for the year ended december   the euroasia division had gross premiums written of million  or of our gross premiums written  compared to million  or  of our gross premiums written for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  our paris office had gross premiums written of million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  our singapore office had gross premiums written of million and million  respectively 
during the last quarter of  first capital had million of direct premiums written 
the euroasia division premiums are geographically dispersed  mainly throughout the european union  followed by japan  eastern europe  the pacific rim  and the middle east 
the euroasia division has been successful in taking advantage of the rate increases throughout its international scope of operations and in creating new market opportunities by leveraging its long term ceding company and broker relationships 
the property and casualty reinsurance and insurance industries use the combined ratio as a measure of underwriting profitability 
the gaap combined ratio is the sum of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of net premiums earned plus underwriting expenses  which include acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses  as a percentage of net premiums earned 
the combined ratio reflects only underwriting results  and does not include income from investments 
underwriting profitability is subject to significant fluctuations due to competition  catastrophic events  economic and social conditions  foreign currency fluctuations and other factors 
our combined ratio for the year ended december   was  a decrease of percentage points from for the year ended december   which excludes the effects of the event of september th and enron 
the combined ratio for the year ended december   including the effects of the event of september th and enron was 
for the years ended december  and  our gross premiums written were billion and billion  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  our net premiums written were billion and million  respectively  and our net income was million  which included a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million and a net loss of million which included a net after tax loss of million related to the effects of the event of september th and enron  
table of contents respectively 
as of december   we had total assets of billion and total stockholders equity of billion 
revenues we derive our revenues from two principal sources premiums from reinsurance assumed and insurance  net of premiums ceded net premiums written  and income from investments 
net premiums written are earned net premiums earned as they are credited to revenue over the terms of the underlying contracts or certificates inforce 
the relationship between net premiums written and net premiums earned will  therefore  vary depending generally on the volume and inception dates of the business assumed and ceded and the mix of such business between proportional and excess of loss reinsurance 
consistent with our significant accounting policies  we utilize estimates in establishing premiums written  the corresponding acquisition expenses and unearned premium reserves 
these estimates are required to reflect differences in the timing of the receipt of accounts from the ceding company and the actual due dates of the accounts at the close of each accounting period 
premium estimates  the corresponding acquisition expenses and unearned premium reserves are established on a contract level for any significant accounts due but not rendered by the ceding company at the end of each accounting period 
the estimated ultimate premium for the contract  actual accounts rendered by the ceding company  and our own experience on the contract are considered in establishing the estimate at the end of each accounting period 
the change in these estimates is reflected in the revenue account at the end of each accounting period 
expenses we determine our reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses based on reports and individual case estimates received from ceding companies 
we use generally accepted actuarial methodologies to determine a reserve for losses incurred but not reported ibnr on the basis of our historical experience and other estimates 
we review the reserves continually and changes in estimates are reflected in the operating results of the period in which they become known 
accordingly  losses and loss adjustment expenses are charged to income in the calendar year they are incurred 
our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimates of amounts required to pay reported and unreported claims and related loss adjustment expenses 
we believe the estimate of these reserves is a critical accounting estimate because changes in these reserves can materially affect net income 
the estimates are based on assumptions related to the ultimate cost to settle these claims 
our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are determined in accordance with sound actuarial practices 
however  the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for reinsurers than for primary insurers  due to the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance contracts and the necessary reliance on ceding companies for information regarding reported claims 
as a result  we cannot be sure that our ultimate liability will not exceed amounts we have reserved 
as of december   our estimate of these liabilities net of reinsurance recoverables was  million  and as of december  was  million 
acquisition costs consist principally of commissions and brokerage expenses incurred on business written under reinsurance contracts or certificates and insurance policies 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
commission adjustments are accrued based on the underwriting profitability of the business produced 
deferred acquisition costs are limited to their estimated realizable value  which considers anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses and estimated remaining costs of servicing the contracts or certificates  all based on our historical experience 
other underwriting expenses consist of cost of operations associated with our underwriting activities 
these expenses include compensation  rent  and all other general expenses allocated to our underwriting activity and exclude any investment or claims related expenses

market sensitive instruments the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we believe that we are principally exposed to four types of market risk related to our investment operations 
these risks are interest rate risk  credit risk  equity price risk and foreign currency risk 

table of contents all market sensitive instruments discussed here relate to our investment assets which are classified as available for sale 
as of december   our billion investment portfolio is comprised of billion of fixed income securities that are subject primarily to interest rate risk and credit risk 
interest rate risk our fixed income securities portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  market values of fixed income securities portfolios fall and vice versa 
the table below displays the potential impact of market value fluctuations on the fixed income securities portfolio as of december  and december   based on parallel basis point shifts in interest rates up and down in basis point increments 
this analysis was performed on each security individually 
as of december  as of december  fair value of fair value of fixed income hypothetical hypothetical fixed income hypothetical hypothetical percent change in interest rates portfolio change change portfolio change change dollars in millions basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline the preceding table indicates an asymmetric market value response to equivalent basis point shifts  up and down in interest rates 
this reflects significant exposure to fixed income securities containing a put feature 
in total these securities represent approximately and of the fair market value of the total fixed income portfolio as of december  and december   respectively 
the asymmetric market value response reflects our ability to put these bonds back to the issuer for early maturity in a rising interest rate environment thereby limiting market value loss but to hold these bonds to their much longer full maturity dates in a falling interest rate environment thereby maximizing the full benefit of higher market values in that environment 
we have gross unrealized appreciation of million  which is offset by gross unrealized depreciation of million  resulting principally from the current interest rate environment 
during the year ended december   we recognized a realized loss of million related to the other than temporary write down of certain fixed income and equity securities 
disclosure about limitations of interest rate sensitivity analysis computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of fixed income security assets  and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of the fair value of fixed rate instruments 
actual values may differ from those projections presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of individual securities  including non parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates and a change in individual issuer credit spreads 
credit risk we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
we control this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities we purchase 
as of december  and december   and  respectively  of our fixed income securities portfolio consisted of securities rated investment grade  with and  respectively  rated below investment grade 

table of contents we believe that this concentration in investment grade securities reduces our exposure to credit risk on these fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
equity price risk as of december  and december   and  respectively  of our investment portfolio  including cash and cash equivalents  was in common stocks unaffiliated and affiliated 
marketable equity securities  which represented approximately and on december  and  respectively of our investment portfolio  including cash and cash equivalents  are exposed to equity price risk  defined as the potential for loss in market value owing to a decline in equity prices 
a decline in the price of each of these marketable equity securities would result in a decline of million and million as of december  and  respectively in the fair value of the total investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk through investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies  we are exposed to foreign non us currency risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the potential for loss in market value owing to a decline in the us dollar value of these investments due to a decline in the exchange rate of the foreign currency in which these assets are denominated 
as of december  and december   our total exposure to foreign denominated securities in us dollar terms was approximately million and million  respectively  or and  respectively  of our investment portfolio  including cash and cash equivalents 
the primary foreign currency exposure was in canadian dollar denominated securities  which represented and as of december  and december   respectively  of our investment portfolio  including cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   the potential impact of a decline in each of the foreign exchange rates on the valuation of investment assets denominated in those respective foreign currencies would result in a total million dollar decline in the fair value of the total investment portfolio 
included above in securities denominated in foreign currencies are japanese yen denominated securities  which as of december  had a us dollar equivalent market value of million
