item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition voluntary reorganization under chapter on june  the petition date  the parent company the parent company of the corporation and the united states subsidiaries listed below collectively  the debtors filed voluntary petitions for reorganization the filing under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the bankruptcy court 
the chapter cases of the debtors collectively  the chapter cases have been consolidated for purposes of joint administration as in re usg corporation et al 
case no 

the chapter cases do not include any of the corporation s non us subsidiaries 
the following subsidiaries filed chapter petitions united states gypsum company  usg interiors  inc  usg interiors international  inc  l w supply corporation  beadex manufacturing  llc  b r pipeline company  la mirada products co  inc  stocking specialists  inc  usg industries  inc  and usg pipeline company 
this action was taken to resolve asbestos related claims in a fair and equitable manner  to protect the long term value of the debtors businesses and to maintain the debtors leadership positions in their markets 
background of the filing us gypsum is a defendant in asbestos lawsuits alleging both property damage and personal injury 
chapter filings during and early by other companies subject to asbestos litigation dramatically increased us gypsum s asbestos costs beyond its legitimate liability 
the corporation has been and continues to be committed to finding a legislative solution to the increase in asbestos costs 
however  in it became apparent that a timely resolution to the problem through legislation was not feasible 
the corporation determined that voluntary protection under chapter would be the best alternative for obtaining a fair and final resolution of us gypsum s asbestos liability and the best way to preserve value for stakeholders 
see part ii  item note litigation for additional information on asbestos litigation 
usg was the eighth major company with a large number of asbestos claims that filed a chapter petition in the months prior to the petition date 
since  us gypsum has been named in more than  asbestos related personal injury claims and made cash payments of approximately million before insurance recoveries to manage and resolve asbestos related litigation 
based on an independent study conducted in and on us gypsum s historical experience of litigating asbestos claims in the tort system  the corporation estimated that us gypsum s probable liability for costs associated with asbestos cases pending as of december   and expected to be filed through to be between million and  million  including defense costs 
in the fourth quarter of  us gypsum recorded a noncash  pretax provision of million  increasing its total accrued reserve for asbestos claims to  million as of december  substantially all of this reserve related to personal injury claims and reflected management s expectation that us gypsum s average cost per case would increase  at least in the short term  due to distortions in the tort system resulting from the bankruptcies of other defendants that led to increased settlement demands from asbestos plaintiffs 
less than of the reserve related to defense and administrative costs 
between january   and the petition date  according to the center for claims resolution the center  us gypsum was served with more than  new claims 
on a cash basis  us gypsum s asbestos related personal injury costs before insurance rose from million in to million in and  absent the filing  were expected to exceed million in because of the filing  there is greater uncertainty concerning the liability associated with asbestos cases 
as a result  it is the corporation s view that no change should be made at this time to the previously recorded reserve for asbestos claims  except to reflect certain minor asbestos related costs incurred since the filing 
however  it is possible that the cost of resolving asbestos claims in the chapter cases will be greater than that set forth in the high end of the range estimated in counsel for the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants and counsel for the legal representative for future asbestos personal injury claimants  appointed in the chapter cases  have indicated that they believe that the liabilities for pending and future asbestos claims exceed the value of debtors assets  and  therefore  are significantly greater than both the reserved amount and the high end of the range estimated in as the chapter cases proceed  and the court addresses the issues relating to estimation of debtors asbestos liabilities  the debtors likely will gain more information from which a reasonable estimate of the debtors probable asbestos liability may be determined 
if such estimate differs from the existing reserve  the reserve will be adjusted to reflect the estimate  and it is possible that a charge to results of operations will be necessary at that time 
it is also possible that  in such a case  the debtors asbestos liability may vary significantly from the recorded estimate of liability and that this difference could be material to the corporation s financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the period recorded 
consequences of the filing the debtors are operating their businesses without interruption as debtors in possession subject to the provisions of the bankruptcy code 
all vendors are being paid for all goods furnished and services provided after the filing 
however  as a consequence of the filing  pending litigation against the debtors as of the petition date is stayed  and no party may take any action to pursue or collect pre petition claims except pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court 
three creditors committees  one representing asbestos personal injury claimants the aforementioned official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants  another representing asbestos property damage claimants  and a third representing general unsecured creditors  were organized in these committees have been appointed as official committees in the chapter cases and  in accordance with the provisions of the bankruptcy code  will have the right to be heard on all matters that come before the bankruptcy court 
the bankruptcy court also appointed the honorable dean m 
trafelet as the legal representative for future asbestos claimants in the debtors bankruptcy proceeding 
mr 
trafelet was formerly a judge of the circuit court of cook county  illinois 
the debtors expect that the appointed committees  together with mr 
trafelet  will play important roles in the chapter cases and the negotiation of the terms of any plan of reorganization 
it is the debtors intention to address all pending and future asbestos related claims and all other pre petition claims in a plan of reorganization 
while it is the debtors intention to seek a full recovery for their creditors  it is not possible to predict at this time how the plan will treat asbestos and other pre petition claims and what impact any reorganization plan may have on the shares of the corporation s common stock and other outstanding securities 
pre petition creditors may receive under a plan or plans less than of the face value of their claims  and the interests of the corporation s equity security holders are likely to be substantially diluted or cancelled in whole or in part 
whether the corporation s equity has significant value and debtors non asbestos creditors recover the full value of their claims depend upon the outcome of the analysis of the amount of debtors assets and liabilities  especially asbestos liabilities  in the chapter cases 
counsel for the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants and counsel for the legal representative for future asbestos personal injury claimants have advised the court that is presiding over the chapter cases that they believe that the debtors asbestos liabilities exceed the value of the debtors assets and that the debtors are insolvent 
the debtors have advised the court that they believe that the debtors are solvent if the asbestos liabilities are fairly and appropriately valued  and the debtors have requested that the court undertake an estimation of those liabilities 
on february   the court ruled on a procedure for estimating debtors liability for asbestos personal injury cases alleging cancer 
see part ii  item note litigation for additional information on this procedure 
if the amount of the debtors asbestos liabilities cannot be resolved through negotiation  as has been the case to date  the outcome of the court proceedings regarding debtors asbestos liabilities likely will be determinative of the debtors solvency and the recovery of the debtors pre petition creditors and equity security holders 
as a result of this uncertainty  it is not possible at this time to predict the timing or outcome of the chapter cases  the terms and provisions of any plan or plans of reorganization  or the effect of the chapter reorganization process on the claims of pre petition creditors of the debtors or the interests of the corporation s equity security holders 
there can be no assurance as to the value of any distributions that might be made under any plan or plans of reorganization with respect to such pre petition claims  equity interests  or other outstanding securities 
recent developments in the corporation s reorganization proceedings are discussed in part ii  item note voluntary reorganization under chapter and note litigation 
chapter financing on july   a million debtor in possession financing facility the dip facility was approved by the bankruptcy court to supplement liquidity and fund operations during the reorganization process 
the facility is provided by a syndicate of lenders led by jpmorgan chase bank formerly the chase manhattan bank as agent 
in january  the corporation reduced the size of the dip facility to million 
this action was taken at the election of the corporation due to the levels of cash and marketable securities on hand and to reduce costs associated with the dip facility 
the resulting dip facility will be used largely to support the issuance of standby letters of credit needed for the corporation s business operations 
the corporation believes that cash and marketable securities on hand and future cash available from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to allow its businesses to operate in the normal course without interruption for the duration of the chapter proceedings 
the dip facility matures on june  see available liquidity below for more information on the dip facility 
accounting impact the corporation is required to follow aicpa statement of position sop  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code 
pursuant to sop  the corporation s pre petition liabilities that are subject to compromise are reported separately on the consolidated balance sheet 
virtually all of the corporation s pre petition debt is currently in default and was recorded at face value and classified within liabilities subject to compromise 
us gypsum s asbestos liability also is classified within liabilities subject to compromise 
see part ii  item note voluntary reorganization under chapter  which includes information related to financial statement presentation  the debtor in possession statements and detail of the liabilities subject to compromise and chapter reorganization expenses 
consolidated results net sales net sales in were  million  up from this increase reflects higher levels of sales for the corporation s north american gypsum and building products distribution segments  partially offset by lower sales for its worldwide ceilings business 
net sales for north american gypsum were up in primarily due to a increase in average selling prices for sheetrock brand gypsum wallboard sold by us gypsum 
shipments of us gypsum s gypsum wallboard were up in versus net sales for building products distribution were up in primarily due to increased shipments and selling prices for gypsum wallboard sold by l w supply 
net sales for worldwide ceilings declined as a result of lower domestic and export shipments of ceiling tile and lower shipments of domestic and internationally produced ceiling grid 
in  net sales of  million were down from this decline was primarily due to lower average selling prices for sheetrock brand gypsum wallboard 
by midyear  selling prices had dropped to their lowest level in nearly a decade 
however  there was some improvement in market conditions during the second half of as demand for gypsum wallboard grew and some excess industry capacity closed  allowing us gypsum and other wallboard manufacturers to raise prices for the first time since the end of cost of products sold cost of products sold totaled  million in   million in and  million in cost of products sold for included an million charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to the downsizing of operations in europe  as discussed below under core business results worldwide ceilings 
however  manufacturing costs in for sheetrock brand gypsum wallboard declined versus primarily due to lower energy costs  partially offset by higher prices for wastepaper  the primary raw material of wallboard paper 
in addition  cost reductions were realized for ceiling tile as a result of lower energy and raw material costs and from the closure of a high cost ceiling tile production line in the fourth quarter of cost of products sold for declined versus primarily due to the absence in of million of asbestos related noncash charges recorded by us gypsum in these asbestos related charges were in addition to the fourth quarter provision of million for asbestos claims 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses totaled million in  million in and million in as a percentage of net sales  these expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
higher selling and administrative expenses in reflect the impact of a bankruptcy court approved key employee retention plan  which became effective in the third quarter of expenses associated with this plan amounted to million in and million in expenses for also reflect a higher level of accruals for incentive compensation associated with the attainment of profit and other performance goals 
expenses were down in versus because of cost reduction initiatives undertaken during the year that resulted in lower charges for compensation and benefits  marketing programs and travel 
these reductions were partially offset by expenses associated with the key employee retention program 
chapter reorganization expenses in connection with the filing  the corporation recorded pretax chapter reorganization expenses of million in these expenses consisted of legal and financial advisory fees of million  partially offset by bankruptcy related interest income of million 
in  the corporation recorded pretax chapter reorganization expenses of million  which consisted of legal and financial advisory fees of million and accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs of million  partially offset by bankruptcy related interest income of million 
provisions for impairment and restructuring in the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded impairment charges totaling million pretax million after tax 
included in this total was million pretax related to the aubange  belgium  ceiling tile plant 
this impairment resulted from a decline in demand  which had been significantly affected by a worldwide slowdown in the nonresidential construction market  and from the plant s high cost structure 
the remaining million pretax related to the port hawkesbury  nova scotia  gypsum fiber panel plant 
this impairment resulted from high delivered costs of products manufactured at port hawkesbury combined with the consolidation of production of fiberock products at the gypsum  ohio  plant 
estimated future cash flows related to these facilities indicated that impairment charges were necessary to write down the assets to their third party appraised fair values 
also  in the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded a charge of million pretax million after tax related to a restructuring plan that included the shutdown of a gypsum wallboard plant in fremont  calif  a drywall steel plant in prestice  czech republic  a ceiling tile plant in san juan ixhuatepec  mexico  a ceiling tile manufacturing line in greenville  miss  and other restructuring activities 
included in the million pretax charge was million for severance related to a workforce reduction of more than positions primarily hourly positions  million for the write off of property  plant and equipment  and million for line shutdown and removal and contract cancellations 
the restructuring was intended to allow the corporation to optimize its manufacturing operations 
as of december   employees were terminated  open positions were eliminated  and the ceiling tile manufacturing line at greenville  miss  and the plants in san juan ixhuatepec  mexico  and prestice  czech republic  were shut down 
the fremont  calif  plant ceased production in the second quarter of  eliminating approximately million square feet of old  high cost gypsum wallboard capacity 
annual savings from the full implementation of the restructuring initiatives are estimated at million 
the reserve for the restructuring plan was included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and charges against the reserve in included the million write off of property  plant and equipment and payments totaling million 
an additional million of payments were made and charged against the reserve in the remaining million of payments are being made and charged against the reserve in the first quarter of all payments associated with the restructuring plan are being funded with cash from operations 
see part ii  item note exit activities for additional information related to restructuring payments and reserve balances 
provision for restructuring in the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded a charge of million pretax million after tax related to a restructuring plan that included a salaried workforce reduction and the shutdown of gypsum wallboard manufacturing lines at us gypsum s plants located at gypsum  ohio  oakfield  ny  and fort dodge  iowa 
together  these closings eliminated approximately million square feet of old  high cost capacity 
the plan also included the shutdown of a mill and ship loading system at alabaster  mich 
included in the million pretax charge was million for severance related to the salaried workforce reduction of more than positions  million for the write off of property  plant and equipment  million for razing buildings and equipment  million for line shutdown and removal and million for contract cancellations and severance for more than hourly positions 
an additional restructuring related charge of million pretax million after tax was included in cost of products sold for the writedown of certain inventory 
this restructuring was designed to streamline operations and improve business efficiency 
during the third quarter of  the corporation reversed million pretax million after tax of the restructuring reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of due to changes from previous estimates and to reflect a change in the scope of restructuring activities undertaken 
the primary change involved a decision made in september to eliminate a portion of the closure activities originally planned at the alabaster  mich  facility 
also  during the third quarter of  the corporation reversed restructuring related inventory reserves totaling million pretax million after tax to cost of products sold because the sale or use of certain affected inventory exceeded expectations 
the salaried workforce reduction program was completed as of june   with the termination of salaried employees and the elimination of open salaried positions 
in addition  hourly employees were terminated  and open hourly positions were eliminated 
closure of the three gypsum wallboard manufacturing lines and other operations was completed by december  annual savings from the restructuring initiatives are estimated at million 
the reserve for the restructuring plan was included in liabilities subject to compromise on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  charges against the reserve through december   included the million write off of property  plant and equipment and payments totaling million 
the remaining million of payments were made and charged against the reserve in all payments associated with the restructuring plan were funded with cash from operations 
see part ii  item note exit activities for additional information related to restructuring payments and reserve balances 
provision for asbestos claims in the fourth quarter of  based on an independent study  usg estimated its probable liability for costs associated with asbestos cases currently pending and expected to be filed through and recorded a noncash provision of million pretax million after tax 
this provision  combined with the existing asbestos related reserve of million  resulted in a total reserve of  million as of december  substantially all of this reserve related to personal injury claims and reflected management s expectation that us gypsum s average cost per case would increase  at least in the short term  due to distortions in the tort system resulting from the bankruptcies of other defendants that led to increased settlement demands from asbestos plaintiffs 
less than of the reserve related to defense and administrative costs 
see part ii  item note litigation for additional information on asbestos related matters

north american gypsum net sales of  million and operating profit of million in were up and  respectively  versus net sales and operating profit in decreased and  respectively  versus net sales for us gypsum increased in primarily due to higher selling prices for sheetrock brand gypsum wallboard 
the average selling price was per thousand square feet  up from in shipments of sheetrock brand gypsum wallboard in totaled a record billion square feet  up from the previous record of billion square feet in us gypsum s plants operated at of capacity in  compared with in shipments of sheetrock brand joint compounds and durock brand cement board also set records in and were up and  respectively  from prior year levels 
operating profit for us gypsum increased significantly in primarily due to the higher wallboard selling prices and increased level of shipments 
manufacturing costs in for sheetrock brand gypsum wallboard declined versus primarily due to lower energy costs  partially offset by higher prices for wastepaper  the primary raw material of wallboard paper 
comparing with  net sales for us gypsum declined in due to lower selling prices 
selling prices for sheetrock brand gypsum wallboard declined steadily during the first half of to a low of per thousand square feet in june  followed by a modest recovery in the second half of the year 
for the full year  the average price was down from in the drop in wallboard prices in reflected excess supply conditions caused by the addition of new industry capacity by us gypsum and other gypsum wallboard manufacturers during  and shipments of sheetrock brand gypsum wallboard in surpassed the previous record of billion square feet in shipments of sheetrock brand joint compounds and durock brand cement board were up and  respectively  from prior year levels 
operating profit for us gypsum declined significantly in versus due to the lower wallboard selling prices  combined with higher manufacturing costs 
manufacturing costs for sheetrock brand gypsum wallboard increased versus primarily due to higher energy costs during the first half of however  energy costs stabilized and began to decrease during the second half of the year 
wallboard costs in also benefited from lower prices for wastepaper and from improved operating efficiencies following the closure of several old facilities and optimization of new plants 
while there were no asbestos related charges in  asbestos related charges to us gypsum s cost of products sold totaled million in net sales and operating profit in for the gypsum business of canada based cgc inc were up and  respectively  versus  primarily reflecting increased shipments of sheetrock brand gypsum wallboard and joint compounds and higher selling prices for joint compounds 
operating profit in also benefited from lower raw material costs 
comparing with  net sales and operating profit decreased and  respectively 
the decline in net sales primarily reflected a decrease in selling prices for cgc s sheetrock brand gypsum wallboard  partially offset by a increase in shipments 
operating profit fell in primarily due to the lower prices and higher manufacturing costs 
worldwide ceilings net sales of million and operating profit of million in were down and  respectively  from net sales for usg interiors  inc  were down from primarily due to lower industry demand for commercial ceiling products in both the united states and europe 
as a result  domestic shipments of ceiling tile and grid and export shipments of ceiling tile were down in however  operating profit for usg interiors increased to million from million in primarily due to lower costs 
cost reductions resulted from lower energy and raw material costs and from the closure of a high cost ceiling tile production line in the fourth quarter of net sales for usg international were down from primarily due to lower demand for ceiling tile and grid in europe 
usg international reported an operating loss of million in  compared with an operating loss of million in the operating loss in included an million charge recorded in the fourth quarter related to management s decision to shut down the aubange  belgium  ceiling tile plant and other downsizing activities that address the continuing weakness of the commercial ceilings market in europe 
the charge was included in cost of products sold and reflected severance of million related to a workforce reduction of approximately positions salaried and hourly  equipment writedowns of million and other reserves of million 
the other reserves primarily related to lease cancellations  inventories and receivables 
comparing with  worldwide ceilings net sales in were million  down versus  while operating profit of million fell 
these results reflected a worldwide slowdown in the nonresidential construction market 
usg interiors reported net sales of million  down  while operating profit of million dropped from domestic shipments of ceiling grid and auratone brand ceiling tile declined and  respectively  from their record levels of due to a significant slowdown in the commercial construction market in the united states 
operating profit for usg interiors also was adversely affected by higher manufacturing costs 
usg international reported a decrease in net sales and an operating loss of million in versus operating profit of million in these unfavorable results were largely attributable to lower demand for ceiling tile and drywall steel in europe 
lower sales also were experienced in the asia pacific region and latin america 
in response to the decline in demand in europe  the corporation determined that the carrying value of the long lived assets at the aubange  belgium  ceiling tile plant was impaired 
accordingly  the corporation recorded a pretax impairment charge of million and began implementing certain restructuring initiatives in europe and elsewhere in the fourth quarter of building products distribution l w supply corporation  the leading specialty building products distribution business in the united states  reported net sales of  million in  a increase from the higher level of sales primarily reflects higher selling prices up and increased shipments up for gypsum wallboard 
in addition  sales of complementary building products  primarily drywall metal  joint treatment  ceiling products  insulation and roofing  increased 
however  operating profit of million fell primarily due to higher gypsum wallboard unit costs up  which more than offset the increases in prices and shipments 
l w supply s gypsum wallboard margin declined as gypsum manufacturers higher selling prices to l w supply were not fully passed on to its customers 
comparing with  l w supply reported net sales in of  million  a decrease from operating profit of million declined 
average selling prices for l w supply s gypsum wallboard in were down from this decline was partially offset by a decrease in unit costs  which primarily reflects manufacturers selling prices to distributors 
shipments of l w supply s gypsum wallboard in were virtually unchanged from the record level of sales and profit for certain complementary building products  primarily drywall metal  joint treatment and ceiling products  also declined from as a result of competitive market conditions 
however  results for insulation and roofing products improved versus l w supply remains focused on opportunities to grow in the most profitable market locations  as well as opportunities to reduce costs and optimize asset utilization 
as part of its plan  l w supply opened or acquired five locations and closed or consolidated four locations during  leaving a total of locations in the united states as of december   compared with locations and locations as of december  and  respectively 
market conditions and outlook industry shipments of gypsum wallboard in the united states were an estimated billion square feet in  a increase from billion square feet in the new housing market was strong in based on preliminary data issued by the us bureau of the census  us housing starts in were an estimated million units  compared with actual housing starts of million units in and million units in the repair and remodel market accounts for the second largest portion of the corporation s sales 
because many buyers begin to remodel an existing home within two years of purchase  opportunity from the repair and remodel market in was fairly solid  as sales of existing homes in and remained at historically high levels 
growth in new housing and a strong level of residential remodeling resulted in first and second quarter records for gypsum wallboard shipments 
the favorable levels of activity in these two markets  which together account for nearly two thirds of all demand for gypsum wallboard  and increased operating rates in the gypsum industry allowed selling prices to rise in the first half of prices remained relatively stable in the second half of future demand for the corporation s products from new nonresidential construction is determined by floor space for which contracts are signed 
installation of gypsum and ceilings products follows signing of construction contracts by about a year 
current information indicates that floor space for which contracts were signed was down significantly in as compared with commercial construction has been affected by reduced corporate earnings  resulting in lower investments in office and other commercial space 
the outlook for the corporation s markets in is mixed 
demand for gypsum wallboard is expected to remain strong primarily due to the continued high demand for new homes 
despite the strong demand  the gypsum wallboard industry is expected to have a large amount of excess capacity 
nonresidential construction  the principal market for the corporation s ceiling products and a major market for its distribution business  is likely to remain weak 
in addition  the corporation  like many other companies  faces cost pressures in areas such as employee and retiree medical expenses  raw material and energy costs and insurance premiums 
in this environment  the corporation is focusing its management attention and investments on improving customer service  manufacturing costs and operating efficiencies  as well as selectively investing to grow its businesses 
in addition  the corporation will diligently continue its attempt to resolve the chapter proceedings  consistent with the goal of achieving a fair  comprehensive and final resolution to its asbestos liability 
liquidity and capital resources working capital working capital current assets less current liabilities as of december   amounted to million  and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to as of december   working capital amounted to million  and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december   amounted to million  compared with million as of december  during  net cash flows from operating activities totaled million 
net cash flows to investing activities totaled million and consisted of capital spending of million  purchases of marketable securities  net of sales and maturities  of million  acquisitions of businesses of million  offset slightly by proceeds of million from asset sales 
because of the filing  there were no financing activities during as of december   million was invested in long term marketable securities and million in short term marketable securities 
the corporation s marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
receivables increased to million as of december   from million as of december   primarily reflecting a increase in net sales for the month of december as compared with december inventories and payables also were up from december   primarily due to the increased level of business 
inventories increased to million from million  and accounts payable increased to million from million 
debt as of december   total debt amounted to  million  of which  million was included in liabilities subject to compromise 
these amounts were unchanged from the december   levels 
available liquidity as of december   the corporation  on a consolidated basis  had million of cash and marketable securities  of which million was held by non debtor subsidiaries 
the corporation also had a million dip facility available to supplement liquidity and fund operations during the reorganization process 
borrowing availability under the dip facility is based primarily on accounts receivable and inventory levels and  to a lesser extent  property  plant and equipment 
given these levels  as of december   the corporation had the capacity to borrow up to million 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the dip facility as of december  however  million of standby letters of credit were outstanding  leaving million of unused borrowing capacity available as of december  in january  the corporation reduced the size of the dip facility to million 
this action was taken at the election of the corporation due to the levels of cash and marketable securities on hand and to reduce costs associated with the dip facility 
the resulting dip facility will be used largely to support the issuance of standby letters of credit needed for the corporation s business operations 
the corporation believes that cash and marketable securities on hand and future cash available from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to allow its businesses to operate in the normal course without interruption for the duration of the chapter proceedings 
capital expenditures capital spending amounted to million in  compared with million in in response to demand  construction of a new production line to manufacture durock brand cement board was completed in the third quarter of at us gypsum s baltimore  md  plant  and a new plant to produce sheetrock brand joint compounds in glendale  ariz  was completed in the fourth quarter of as of december   remaining capital expenditure commitments for the replacement  modernization and expansion of operations amounted to million  compared with million as of december  during the bankruptcy proceeding  the corporation expects to have limited ability to access capital other than its own cash flows to fund potential future growth opportunities such as new products  acquisitions and joint ventures 
in addition  one of the terms of the dip facility limits capital spending to a total of million per year 
within such constraints  the corporation expects to be able to maintain a program of capital spending aimed at maintaining and enhancing its businesses 
contractual obligations and committments as of december   the corporation s lease obligations totaled million  and future minimum lease payments required under operating leases with initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year as of december   were million in  million in  million in  million in and million in the aggregate lease obligation subsequent to was million

the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries have been notified by state and federal environmental protection agencies of possible involvement as one of numerous potentially responsible parties in a number of so called superfund sites in the united states 
the corporation believes that neither these matters nor any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental matters will have a material adverse effect upon its results of operations or financial position 
see part ii  item note litigation for additional information on environmental litigation 
critical accounting policies the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies the corporation believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results 
voluntary reorganization under chapter as a result of the filing  the corporation s consolidated financial statements reflect the provisions of sop and are prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates continuity of operations  realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
however  because of the filing  such realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities  without substantial adjustments and or changes of ownership  are subject to uncertainty 
given this uncertainty  there is substantial doubt about the corporation s ability to continue as a going concern 
such doubt includes  but is not limited to  a possible change in control of the corporation  as well as a potential change in the composition of the corporation s business portfolio 
while operating as debtors in possession under the protection of chapter of the bankruptcy code and subject to bankruptcy court approval or otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business  the debtors  or any of them  may sell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for amounts other than those reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
further  a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications in the historical consolidated financial statements 
one of the key provisions of sop requires the reporting of the debtors liabilities incurred prior to the commencement of the chapter cases as liabilities subject to compromise 
the various liabilities that are subject to compromise include us gypsum s asbestos reserve and the debtors pre petition debt  accounts payable  accrued expenses and other long term liabilities 
the amounts for these items represent the debtors estimate of known or potential pre petition claims to be resolved in connection with the chapter cases 
such claims remain subject to future adjustments 
adjustments may result from i negotiations ii actions of the bankruptcy court iii further developments with respect to disputed claims iv rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases v the determination as to the value of any collateral securing claims vi proofs of claim or vii other events 
in particular  the amount of the asbestos reserve reflects us gypsum s pre petition estimate of liability associated with asbestos claims to be filed in the tort system through  and this liability  including liability for post claims  is the subject of significant legal proceedings and negotiation in the chapter cases 
other provisions of sop involve interest expense and interest income

asbestos liability in evaluating us gypsum s estimated asbestos liability prior to the filing  the corporation considered numerous uncertainties that made it difficult to estimate reliably us gypsum s asbestos liability in the tort system for both pending and future asbestos claims 
in the property damage cases as defined in part ii  item note litigation  such uncertainties included  but were not limited to  the identification and volume of asbestos containing products in the buildings at issue in each case  which is often disputed  the claimed damages associated therewith  the viability of statute of limitations  product identification and other defenses  which varies depending upon the facts and jurisdiction of each case  the amount for which such cases can be resolved  which normally but not uniformly has been substantially lower than the claimed damages  and the viability of claims for punitive and other forms of multiple damages 
uncertainties in the personal injury cases as defined in part ii  item note litigation included  but were not limited to  the number  disease and occupational characteristics  and jurisdiction of personal injury cases that are filed against us gypsum  the age and level of asbestos related disease of claimants  the viability of claims for conspiracy or punitive damages  the elimination of indemnity sharing among members of the center for future settlements and its negative impact on us gypsum s ability to continue to resolve claims at historical or acceptable levels  the adverse impact on us gypsum s settlement costs of bankruptcies of co defendants  the continued solvency of other defendants and the possibility of additional bankruptcies  the possibility of significant adverse verdicts due to recent changes in settlement strategies and related effects on liquidity  the inability or refusal of former center members to fund their share of existing settlements and its effect on such settlement agreements  the continued ability to negotiate settlements or develop other mechanisms that defer or reduce claims from unimpaired claimants  and the possibility that federal legislation addressing asbestos litigation would be enacted 
in  an independent actuarial study of us gypsum s current and potential future asbestos liability was completed 
this analysis was based on the assumption that us gypsum s asbestos liability would continue to be resolved in the tort system 
as part of this analysis  the corporation reviewed  among other things  historical case filings and increasing settlement costs  the type of products us gypsum sold and the occupations of claimants expected to bring future asbestos related claims  epidemiological data concerning the incidence of past and projected future asbestos related diseases  trends in the propensity of persons alleging asbestos related disease to sue us gypsum  the adverse effect on settlement costs of historical reductions in the number of solvent defendants available to pay claims  including reductions in membership of the center  the pre agreed settlement recommendations in  and the continued viability of  long term settlements  and anticipated trends in recruitment by plaintiffs law firms of non malignant or unimpaired claimants 
the study attempted to weigh relevant variables and assess the impact of likely outcomes on future case filings and settlement costs 
in addition  the corporation considered future defense costs  as well as allegations that us gypsum and the other center members bear joint liability for the share of certain settlement agreements that was to be paid by former members that now have refused or are unable to pay 
based on the results of the actuarial study  the corporation determined that  although substantial uncertainty remained  it was probable that asbestos claims currently pending against us gypsum and future asbestos claims to be filed against it through both property damage and personal injury could be resolved in the tort system for an amount between million and  million  including defense costs  and that within this range the most likely estimate was  million 
consistent with this analysis  in  the corporation recorded a pretax noncash charge of million to results of operations  which  combined with the previously existing reserve  increased us gypsum s reserve for asbestos claims to  million 
it is the corporation s view that  as a result of the filing  there is even greater uncertainty in estimating the reasonably possible range of asbestos liability for pending and future claims  as well as the most likely estimate of liability within this range 
there are significant differences in the treatment of asbestos claims in a bankruptcy proceeding as compared to the tort litigation system 
among other things  these uncertainties include how certain long term settlements will be treated in the bankruptcy proceeding and plan of reorganization and whether those settlements will be set aside  the number of asbestos related claims that will be filed in the proceeding  the number of future claims that will be estimated in connection with preparing a plan of reorganization  how claims for punitive damages and claims by persons with no asbestos related disease will be treated and whether such claims will be allowed  the impact historical settlement values for asbestos claims may have on the estimation of asbestos liability in the bankruptcy proceeding  and the impact any relevant potential federal legislation may have on the proceeding 
these factors  as well as the uncertainties discussed above in connection with the resolution of asbestos cases in the tort system  increase the uncertainty of any estimate of asbestos liability 
as a result of the increased uncertainty in estimating the asbestos liability due to the filing  no change has been made at this time to the previously recorded reserve for asbestos claims  except to reflect certain minor asbestos related costs incurred since the filing 
however  it is possible that the cost of resolving asbestos claims in the chapter cases will be greater than that set forth in the high end of the range estimated in counsel for the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants and counsel for the legal representative for future asbestos personal injury claimants  appointed in the chapter cases  have indicated that they believe that the liabilities for pending and future asbestos claims exceed the value of debtors assets  and  therefore  are significantly greater than both the reserved amount and the high end of the range estimated in as the chapter cases proceed  and the court addresses the issues relating to estimation of debtors asbestos liabilities  the debtors likely will gain more information from which a reasonable estimate of the debtors probable asbestos liability may be determined 
if such estimate differs from the existing reserve  the reserve will be adjusted to reflect the estimate  and it is possible that a charge to results of operations will be necessary at that time 
it is also possible that  in such a case  the debtors asbestos liability may vary significantly from the recorded estimate of liability and that this difference could be material to the corporation s financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the period recorded

self insurance reserves the corporation purchases third party insurance for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability claims that exceed a certain level 
however  the corporation is responsible for the payment of claims under these insured limits 
in estimating the obligation associated with incurred losses  the corporation utilizes loss development factors prepared by actuarial consultants 
these development factors use historical data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon the shipment of products and transfer of risk of loss to customers 
the corporation s products are shipped fob shipping point 
provisions for discounts to customers are recorded based on the terms of sale in the same period the related sales are recorded 
the corporation also records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including promotions and other volume based incentives 
adoption of sfas no 
on january   the corporation adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
although sfas no 
eliminated the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets  it initiated an annual assessment of goodwill for impairment 
the initial assessment was completed as of the adoption date 
this assessment  based on discounted cash flows  was performed for each reporting unit as defined by sfas no 
that had goodwill 
the corporation determined that goodwill for its building products distribution segment was not impaired  but goodwill for its north american gypsum segment was impaired 
this impairment was attributable to us gypsum s asbestos liability and related filing for bankruptcy protection on june  see part ii  item note accounting for goodwill for additional information related to the impact of this change in accounting principle 
recent accounting pronouncements as noted above  on january   the corporation adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption  the corporation recorded a noncash  nontaxable impairment charge of million 
this charge  which includes a million deferred currency translation write off  is reflected on the corporation s consolidated statement of earnings as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  supersedes sfas no 
and a portion of apb opinion no 
this standard establishes a single accounting model for the disposal of long lived assets and resolves significant implementation issues related to sfas no 
this standard  which became effective for the corporation on january   had no impact on the corporation s financial statements upon adoption 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
the corporation has determined that the estimated impact of adopting sfas no 
on the effective date of january   will be an increase in assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively 
a charge of million net of tax of million will be reflected on the consolidated statement of earnings as of january   as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized at fair value when the costs are incurred  rather than at a date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this standard becomes effective for exit and disposal activities initiated on or after january  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
this standard also amends disclosure provisions to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the corporation adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 which became effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements related to management s expectations about future conditions 
the effects of the filing and the conduct  outcome and costs of the chapter cases  as well as the ultimate costs associated with the corporation s asbestos litigation  may differ from management s expectations 
actual business or other conditions may also differ significantly from management s expectations and accordingly affect the corporation s sales and profitability or other results 
actual results may differ due to various other factors  including economic conditions such as the levels of construction activity  interest rates  currency exchange rates and consumer confidence  competitive conditions such as price and product competition  shortages in raw materials  increases in raw material and energy costs  and the unpredictable effects of the global war on terrorism upon domestic and international economies and financial markets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risks in the normal course of business  the corporation uses financial instruments  including fixed and variable rate debt  to finance its operations 
in addition  the corporation uses derivative instruments from time to time to manage commodity price and foreign currency exposures 
the corporation does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the corporation has interest rate risk with respect to the fair market value of its marketable securities portfolio 
derivative instruments are used to enhance the liquidity of the marketable securities portfolio 
the corporation s million of marketable securities consist of debt instruments that generate interest income for the corporation on excess cash balances generated during the corporation s chapter bankruptcy proceeding 
a portion of these instruments contain embedded derivative features that enhance the liquidity of the portfolio by enabling the corporation to liquidate the instrument prior to the stated maturity date  thus shortening the average duration of the portfolio to less than one year 
based on results of a sensitivity analysis  which may differ from actual results  the corporation s exposure to interest rate fluctuations is not material 
commodity price risk the corporation uses swap contracts from time to time to manage its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices associated with anticipated purchases of natural gas  wastepaper and fuel 
a sensitivity analysis was prepared to estimate the potential change in the fair value of the corporation s natural gas swap contracts assuming a hypothetical change in market prices 
based on results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  the potential change in the fair value of the corporation s natural gas swap contracts is million 
this analysis does not consider the underlying exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk the corporation has operations in a number of countries and uses forward contracts from time to time to hedge the risk of changes in cash flows resulting from forecasted intercompany and third party sales or purchases in non us currencies 
as of december   the corporation had no outstanding forward contracts
