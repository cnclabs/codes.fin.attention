item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception in april  cell genesys has focused its research and product development efforts on human disease therapies that are based on innovative gene modification technologies 
the company s strategic objective is to develop and commercialize biological therapies  including cancer vaccines  oncolytic virus therapies and cancer gene therapies  to treat multiple types of cancer 
cell genesys current clinical programs include gvax cancer vaccines and oncolytic virus therapies 
gvax cancer vaccines are in phase studies for prostate cancer  lung cancer  pancreatic cancer and leukemia and in phase studies for multiple myeloma 
the company expects to initiate phase trials for gvax prostate cancer vaccine and gvax lung cancer vaccine during the next year 
ongoing clinical programs evaluating the company s oncolytic virus therapies include a phase study of cg  an intratumorally administered therapy for early stage prostate cancer 
in addition  cell genesys has preclinical oncolytic virus therapy programs evaluating potential therapies for bladder cancer  liver cancer and colon cancer as well as preclinical cancer gene therapy programs evaluating potential therapies for multiple types of cancer 
the company plans to file an ind for cg  an oncolytic virus therapy for the treatment of bladder cancer  during the next year 
additionally  cell genesys has a majority owned subsidiary  ceregene  inc  which is focused on gene therapies for neurological disorders  and continues to hold approximately million shares of common stock of its former subsidiary  abgenix  inc nasdaq abgx  which is focused on the development and commercialization of antibody therapies 
critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  lease accounting  income taxes and use of estimates to to be critical policies 
revenue recognition since the company s inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from research and licensing agreements with collaborators 
revenue under such collaboration agreements typically include upfront payments  cost reimbursements and milestone payments 
revenue under these agreements from non refundable upfront license fees and other payments where the company continues involvement through development is recognized ratably over the development period 
the company recognizes cost reimbursement revenue under collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs are incurred 
incentive milestone payments under collaborative arrangements are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone events  which represent the culmination of the earnings process 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to cell genesys  such as regulatory approval to market a product or the achievement of specified sales levels by a marketing partner 
as such  the incentive milestones are substantially at risk at the inception of the contract and the values assigned thereto are commensurate with the milestone achieved 
upon the achievement of an incentive milestone event  the company has no future performance obligations related to that payment 
deferred revenue represents the portion of research payments received that has not been earned 
lease accounting during the three month period ended december   the company recorded a charge of approximately million for lease exit costs associated with the company s move to the south san francisco  california headquarters in march cell genesys utilized current market conditions to estimate the charge for lease exit costs related to the move of its corporate headquarters to south san francisco  california and the related vacancy in foster city  california 
total rent payments for the company s foster city location are million 
the charge will be adjusted as necessary based on our ability to sub lease the facilities and then current market conditions 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates in the financial statements include  but are not limited to  accrued but unbilled expenses in clinical trials  expenses for certain outside experts and consultants useful lives of property and equipment  and other items 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
if we determined that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net deferred tax assets  adjustments to the deferred tax assets would increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that we made such determination 
likewise  if we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the deferred tax assets would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that we made such determination 
results of operations revenue revenue increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in revenues in can be attributed primarily to the receipt of an upfront fee of million associated with a license agreement with transkaryotic therapies  inc tkt for the company s gene activation technology 
revenue from the company s gvax collaboration agreement with the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco jt for was million compared to million in and million in of the revenue from jt in  million  or percent was related to cost reimbursement 
the decrease in revenue under the jt agreement is attributed to the termination of the license agreement with jt in october which pertained to gvax lung cancer vaccines 
previously during  the company had restructured its gvax collaboration with jt to regain full rights to its gvax prostate cancer vaccine program and converted its gvax lung cancer vaccine program to a reciprocal royalty arrangement 
under the october termination agreement  full commercial rights to the entire gvax cancer vaccine portfolio was reverted to cell genesys 
revenues for were impacted by the adoption of sab and the resulting change in the company s revenue recognition policy 
as a result of the adoption of sab  a cumulative effect of a change in accounting of million  net of taxes  was recorded in see the revenue recognition note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our adoption of sab 
the company s gene activation technology agreement with aventis for gene activated erythropoietin epo provides for milestone payments and annual maintenance fees  in addition to royalties on future sales of gene activated epo products 
the company recognized revenue of million  million and million in  and  respectively  pursuant to the aventis agreement 
of the revenue from aventis during  million  or percent was related to an annual maintenance 
research and development expenses research and development costs increased to million in from million during  and million in the increase can be attributed primarily to the company s expanding clinical trials for both its gvax cancer vaccines and oncolytic virus therapy programs 
during  the company advanced its clinical trial programs  including trials of gvax vaccines in multiple cancers and oncolytic virus therapies  as well as its preclinical cancer gene therapy programs 
the company expects that its research and development expenditures will continue to increase in future years to support expanded  more advanced and more numerous clinical trials and additional product development activities 
the rate of increase depends on a number of factors  including progress in research and development and the results of clinical trials 
biopharmaceutical products such as those developed by cell genesys generally take to years to research  develop and bring to market in the united states 
drug development in the us is a process that includes several steps regulated by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an ind which  if successful  allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase   and costs for each phase are generally larger than the preceding phase  as the size of the clinical trial number of patients grows 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we currently have two products in development that have been targeted for phase studies 
however  the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
estimates of product completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
however  we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are usually completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years many factors may delay our commencement and speed of completion of clinical trials  including the size number of patients participating in the trial  the duration of patient follow up required  the number of clinical sites at which the trial is conducted  and the length of time required to locate and enroll suitable patient subjects 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to a bla  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
there can be no assurance that any approval required by the fda or other regulatory body will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
for additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see other factors affecting future operations below 
included below is a summary of products and the related stage of development for each product in clinical development 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of phase contains forward looking statements regarding timing of completion of product development phases 
timing of completion of these trials is based on typical times to completion for trials of that type at such phases of development 
the actual timing of completion of these phases of clinical trials could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table due to the number of patients enrolled in the trial  the number of clinical trial sites involved  the time needed to fully enroll the trial  the time required for patient follow up and other factors 
in addition  it is possible that any of these ongoing clinical trials may never be completed due to the occurrence of unacceptable treatment related side effects  lack of clinical efficacy  insufficient supply of product for these clinical trials and other factors 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see other factors affecting future operations below 
phase of estimiated co mpletion product indication development of phase gvax reg  prostate prostate cancer phase gvax reg  lung non small cell lung cancer phase gvax reg  pancreatic pancreatic cancer phase gvax reg  leukemia acute leukemia phase gvax reg  myeloma multiple myeloma phase cv oncolytic virus prostate cancer phase general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million during  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
during  cell genesys recorded a charge of approximately million for lease exit costs for its facilities in foster city  california  in association with the move to its new facilities in south san francisco 
in addition  the remaining increase in was primarily attributed to approximately million related to increased headcount costs and increased facility related costs of million 
of the increase in compared to  approximately million was related to headcount costs  million increased facility costs and increased consulting services 
excluding the impact of the million lease exit charge  future spending for general and administrative costs is expected to continue to increase in future years to support the growing infrastructure needs of the company  particularly in the area of facilities 
purchased in process technology during  cell genesys recorded a credit of  to purchased in process technology related to its acquisition of calydon  inc in the adjustment related to the return to cell genesys of a portion of the purchase price held in escrow in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement 
in  cell genesys recorded a charge of million for the purchased in process technology from the acquisition of calydon  and does not anticipate that there is any alternative future use for the in process technology that was expensed 
cell genesys continues research in the technology acquired in the acquisition of calydon 
interest income  interest expense and other income interest and other income was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the higher income in compared to and is a result of higher average cash balances  plus million of realized gains earned from the sale of certain tax free securities during the first quarter of also  interest rates in and the latter part of were lower compared to rates in in  the company realized million gain on the sale of abgenix stock 
in  the company realized million gain on the sale of abgenix common stock 
the company did not sell any abgenix common stock during interest expense increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in is a result of a million liquid collateral debt financing completed in december in connection with the construction of the company s manufacturing facility in hayward  california 
the company capitalized interest expense in of approximately  as part of the construction costs 
income taxes the company recorded a tax benefit for of million and for  which primarily represents the estimated refund available from the carryback of losses to offset taxable income in in  cell genesys recorded a tax provision of million primarily as a result of gains from its sale of abgenix stock 
at december   cell genesys had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating losses will expire in the years through  if not utilized 
the large capital gains associated with the sale of a portion of the company s investment in abgenix during february and november were substantially offset by utilizing a large portion of the company s previously available net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
losses  excluding non recurring charges and gains from sales of abgenix stock  are expected to continue and may increase in future years as operating expenses rise  particularly as the company incurs expenses related to manufacturing and late stage human testing of its potential products 
liquidity and capital resources cell genesys ended with approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  of which million is classified as restricted cash primarily related to the company s debt financing 
information regarding the classification of these assets is included in notes to financial statements  fair value of financial instruments 
the company has maintained its financial position through strategic management of its resources including the company s holdings in abgenix of which cell genesys continues to hold approximately million shares of common stock and by relying on funding from various corporate collaborations and licensing agreements 
additionally  in december  the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec pursuant to rule under the securities act of  as amended  which  once effective  would allow the company to offer up to million of securities on short notice in subsequent public offerings 
however  there can be no assurance the company will be able to issue such securities on acceptable terms  or at all 
cell genesys has financed its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  funding under collaborative arrangements  sales of abgenix common stock and secured financing 
in and  cell genesys received approximately million and million  respectively  in net proceeds from the sale of shares of abgenix common stock 
cell genesys did not sell any abgenix stock in in connection with the gain on sale of abgenix common stock in  the company paid million in federal and state income tax 
the company recorded a tax benefit for of million  which represents the estimated refund available primarily from the carryback of losses in to offset taxable income in since the company has received million in tax refunds from the carryback of losses 
the company has additional unutilized net operating loss nol carryforwards  although the future utilization of these nol carryforwards is limited by irs regulation section  which imposes an annual limitation on taxable income that can be offset by nols following a change in control 
the company  for irs purposes  experienced a change in control during its acquisition of somatix in it is the company s current intention to minimize future tax liabilities on sales of abgenix stock by offsetting gains against current operating losses and the nol carryforwards allowed under section in addition  the company has certain research and development tax credits which it may utilize to offset the tax effects of such gains 
however  under some circumstances the company may sell more abgenix stock and consequently recognize more gain than it may be able to shelter from tax using these methods 
future minimum payments under non cancelable operating leases  capital leases and debt financing at december   were in thousands operating capital debt leases leases financi ng years ending december and beyond    total minimum payments    less amount representing interest and executory costs   present value of future debt payments   less current portion of future payments   non current portion of payments   total operating lease commitments include rent payments for the company s foster city facilities of million  of which million was accrued as of december  as part of the estimated facility exit costs associated with our move to the south san francisco  california headquarters in march cell genesys leases certain of its facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
these leases  including the hayward  foster city  san diego and memphis facilities expire at various dates through and contain options for renewal 
the south san francisco facility lease is recorded as a capital lease as a result of certain amendments which required cell genesys to fund the costs of certain structural components of the facility 
the company s debt financing was obtained in conjunction with the construction of its hayward manufacturing facility 
for  the debt financing bears an interest rate of libor london interbank offering rate plus percent  and a term of six years 
in january  the rate was reduced to libor plus percent 
cell genesys paid interest only for the first year  and will make quarterly payments of principle and interest and approximately a percent balloon payment at the end of the six year term 
ceregene  a subsidiary of cell genesys  also maintains capital leases to fund the purchases of furniture and machinery equipment 
the company has completed construction of its manufacturing facility for non patient specific cell based vaccines in hayward  california 
expenditures associated with the completion and validation of this facility during are expected to total approximately million 
in addition  the company has completed the construction of its new manufacturing facility in memphis  tennessee that will be devoted to the manufacturing of patient specific vaccines for lung cancer 
total additional costs for equipment and improvements for this facility are expected to approximate million in cell genesys moved to its new headquarters facility in south san francisco in march the headquarters include both the company s research and development laboratories and administrative offices 
total additional costs for build out of tenant improvements for this facility during are expected to be approximately million 
cell genesys anticipates that its net operating use of cash during will be approximately million 
net operating use of cash does not include capital expenditures or the cost of any potential acquisitions  nor does it reflect the potential offset by future sales of abgenix stock or equity or debt financings 
the company s capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the progress of the company s research and development programs and its preclinical and clinical trials  clinical and commercial scale manufacturing requirements  the extent of funding from collaborative partners  the acquisition of new products or technologies  and the cost and outcome of litigation  patent interference proceedings or other legal proceedings 
the company s ongoing development programs and any increase in the number and size of programs and trials will reduce the company s current cash resources and potentially create the need to raise further capital 
therefore  the company may continue to consider financing alternatives  including potential equity and debt financings in addition to periodic sales of the company s holdings of abgenix stock 
a substantial portion of the company s working capital consists of holdings of shares its former subsidiary  abgenix 
these shares are carried at market value and have been subject to extreme fluctuations in recent quarters due to the highly volatile nature of the market price of abgenix stock 
to the extent that the company continues to hold a substantial amount of these shares  the company s working capital position can be expected to continue to fluctuate in future periods 
the value of the company s investment in abgenix common stock holdings was approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  in june  the company completed a license agreement with tkt under which it was to receive a portion of the consideration in the form of tkt common stock  the number of shares of which was to be determined when the shares became freely tradable  such that the shares would have a market value of million at that time 
in january  the company  under an amended agreement with tkt  received million in cash in lieu of the tkt stock that was to be issued under the original license agreement 
based on this amended agreement  the company has reclassified the investment in tkt as previously reported in the company s quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september   to receivable from tkt at december  while cell genesys believes that its current liquidity position will be sufficient to meet its cash needs for at least the next year  the company may entertain the possibility of raising additional capital to preserve its liquidity  depending on a number of conditions  including conditions in the capital markets 
the sources of liquidity available to the company include the sale of abgenix securities  asset backed debt financing  private or public placement of cell genesys equity securities  warrants  debt securities or depositary shares 
the company s evaluation processes regularly consider the liquidity of capital markets  dilution  stockholder value and tax consequences of each type of financing on stockholders 
certain of the financing options available to the company may have negative consequences to stockholders such as dilution 
given the volatile nature of the capital markets  decisions to raise capital may require actions that would impose a negative consequence in order to reduce or minimize a more significant negative consequence to stockholders 
recent accounting pronouncements business combinations in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and changes the criteria for recognition of intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
the provisions of sfas apply to all business combinations initiated after june   including the company s acquisition of calydon  inc in september sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  however  these assets must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
the standard also establishes specific guidance for testing for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
as the company does not have goodwill recorded from previous acquisitions  the transitional impairment test was not applicable and the adoption of sfas did not impact the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
asset retirement obligations in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligation 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
the adoption of sfas in did not impact the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
asset impairments in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the adoption of sfas in did not impact the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
exit or disposal activities in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities which addresses accounting for restructuring  discontinued operations  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december   and earlier adoption is encouraged 
the company intends to adopt sfas as of january  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including direct guarantees of indebtedness of others in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others the interpretation 
the interpretation applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset  liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party 
the company adopted the disclosure provisions of this interpretation in and does not expect the adoption of the recognition and measurement requirements to impact cell genesys financial position or results of operations 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in november  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a company for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
eitf provides guidance with respect to the effect of certain customer rights due to company nonperformance on the recognition of revenue allocated to delivered units of accounting 
eitf also addresses the impact on the measurement and or allocation of arrangement consideration of customer cancellation provisions and consideration that varies as a result of future actions of the customer or the company 
finally  eitf provides guidance with respect to the recognition of the cost of certain deliverables that are excluded from the revenue accounting arrangement 
the provisions of eitf will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  cell genesys is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf will have on its financial condition and results of operations 
consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim periods beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable entity was established 
cell genesys does not have variable interest entities and does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
other factors affecting future operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business could be harmed by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
risks related to our company our products are in developmental stage  are not approved for commercial sale and might not ever receive regulatory approval or become commercially viable 
all of our potential cancer vaccines  oncolytic virus therapies and cancer gene therapy products are in research and development 
we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products 
we do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales for at least the next several years 
our products currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts  including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval  prior to commercial use 
our research and development efforts may not be successful and any of our future products may not be ultimately commercially successful 
even if developed  our products may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully introduced and marketed at prices that would permit us to operate profitably 
our cancer vaccine  oncolytic virus therapies and cancer gene therapy programs must undergo exhaustive clinical testing and may not prove to be safe or effective 
if any of our proposed products are delayed or fail  we may have to curtail our operations 
gene therapy is a new technology 
existing preclinical and clinical data on the safety and efficacy of gene therapy are limited 
data relating to our specific gene therapy approaches are also limited 
our gvax cancer vaccines and oncolytic virus therapies are currently being tested in human clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy 
none of our other products or therapies under development are in human clinical trials 
the results of preclinical studies do not predict safety or efficacy in humans 
unacceptable side effects may be discovered during preclinical and clinical testing of our potential products or thereafter 
possible side effects of gene therapy may be serious and potentially life threatening 
there are many reasons that potential products that appear promising at an early stage of research or development do not result in commercially successful products 
although we are testing proposed products or therapies in human clinical trials  we cannot guarantee that we will be permitted to undertake human clinical trials for any of our other products or that adequate numbers of patients can be recruited for our clinical trials 
also  the results of this testing might not demonstrate the safety or efficacy of these products 
even if clinical trials are successful  we might not obtain regulatory approval for any indication 
finally  even if our products proceed successfully through clinical trials and receive regulatory approval  there is no guarantee that an approved product can be manufactured in commercial quantities at reasonable cost or that such a product will be successfully marketed 
we have not been profitable in our operations absent the gains on sales of abgenix stock and certain upfront or non recurring license fees 
we expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and may not become profitable in the future 
we have incurred an accumulated deficit since our inception 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million  compared with million at december  our accumulated deficit would be substantially higher absent the gains we have realized on sales of our abgenix stock 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss attributed to common stockholders of million  which included revenue of million from an upfront fee in connection with the company s license agreement with tkt in june we expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years 
this is due primarily to the expansion of research and development programs  clinical trials and manufacturing activities and  to a lesser extent  general and administrative expenses 
we also have substantial lease obligations related to our new manufacturing and headquarter facilities impacting operating expenses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
we cannot guarantee that we will successfully develop  manufacture  commercialize or market any products 
we cannot guarantee that we will ever achieve or sustain product revenues or profitability 
we will need substantial additional funds to continue operations  and our ability to generate funds depends on many factors beyond our control 
we will need substantial funds for existing and planned preclinical and clinical trials  to continue research and development activities  for lease obligations related to our manufacturing and headquarter facilities  and to establish manufacturing and marketing capabilities for any products we may develop 
at some point in the future  we will also need to raise additional capital just to fund our operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on  and could increase as a result of  many factors  such as the progress and scope of our internally funded research  development and commercialization activities  our ability to establish new collaborations and the terms of those collaborations  competing technological and market developments  the time and cost of regulatory approval  the extent to which we choose to commercialize our future products through our own sales and marketing capabilities  the costs we incur in obtaining and enforcing patent and other proprietary rights or gaining the freedom to operate under the patents of others  and our success in acquiring and integrating complementary products  technologies or businesses 
we plan to raise additional funds through collaborative relationships  sales of some portion or all of our investment in abgenix  additional equity or debt financings  or otherwise  but we may not be able to do any of the foregoing on favorable terms  or at all 
because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
additional funding may not be available to us  and  if available  may not be on acceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  stockholders will incur immediate dilution 
opportunities for in licensing technologies or for third party collaborations may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research  development and clinical activities 
alternatively  we may need to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that require us to relinquish rights to technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flow 
currently  we have no collaborative partners for the development of our gvax cancer vaccines or oncolytic virus therapy products 
in october  our remaining license agreement with the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco for gvax lung cancer vaccine was terminated  and we will not receive any additional payments under this collaboration for the future development costs of this product 
our ability to manufacture our products is uncertain  which may delay or impair our ability to develop  test and commercialize our products 
we are building our own manufacturing facilities in compliance with fda good manufacturing practices regulatory requirements for the manufacture of products for clinical trials and to support the potential commercial launch of our product candidates 
we are under significant lease obligations for each of our facilities 
completion of these facilities could take longer than expected  and our inability to establish and maintain the facilities within our planned time and budget could materially affect our product development timelines 
our manufacturing facilities will be subject to ongoing  periodic inspection by the fda and state agencies to ensure compliance with good manufacturing practices 
we also may encounter problems with the following achieving consistent production yield and costs  meeting product release specifications  quality control and assurance  shortages of qualified manufacturing personnel  shortages of raw materials  shortages of key contractors  and ongoing compliance with fda and other regulations 
developing advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls is required to fully utilize our expanded facilities 
we may not be able to develop these techniques and process controls to manufacture our products effectively to meet demands of clinical testing and production 
if we are unable to manufacture our products for any reason  our options for outsourcing manufacturing are currently limited 
we are unaware of available contract manufacturing facilities on a worldwide basis in which our product candidates can be manufactured under good manufacturing practices regulations  a requirement for all pharmaceutical products 
it would take a substantial period of time for a contract manufacturing facility that has not been producing our particular products to begin producing them under good manufacturing practices regulations 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to licensing requirements of the california department of health services and the tennessee department of commerce and insurance  board of pharmacy  referred to as the tennessee board of pharmacy 
while not subject to license by the fda  these facilities are subject to inspection by the fda  as well as by the california department of health services and the tennessee board of pharmacy 
failure to maintain these licenses or to meet the inspection criteria of the fda  the california department of health services or the tennessee board of pharmacy would disrupt our manufacturing processes and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
if our proposed products are not effectively protected by issued patents or if we are not otherwise able to protect our proprietary information  we will be more vulnerable to competitors and our business could be adversely affected 
we rely heavily on the development and protection of our intellectual property portfolio 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms  including cell genesys  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
as of december   we had approximately issued or granted patents and approximately pending applications 
although we are prosecuting patent applications  we cannot be certain whether any given application will result in the issuance of a patent or  if any patent is issued  whether it will provide significant proprietary protection or will be invalidated 
also  patent applications in the united states are confidential until patents are issued 
publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 
accordingly  we cannot be sure that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions 
in addition  to the extent we license our intellectual property to other parties  we may incur expenses as a result of contractual agreements in which we indemnify these licensing parties against losses incurred if our intellectual property infringes upon the rights of others 
our intellectual property may be challenged by our competitors in the future  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
our commercial success depends in part on not infringing the patents or proprietary rights of others and not breaching licensees granted to us 
we are aware of competing intellectual property relating to both our programs in cancer vaccines and oncolytic virus therapies 
while we currently believe we have freedom to operate in these areas  our position may be challenged by others in the future 
we may be required to obtain licenses to third party technologies or genes necessary in order to market our products 
any failure to license any technologies or genes required to commercialize our technologies or products at reasonable cost may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
we may have to engage in litigation  which could result in substantial cost  to enforce our patents or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights 
to determine the priority of inventions  the united states patent and trademark office frequently declares interference proceedings 
in europe  patents can be revoked through opposition proceedings 
these proceedings could result in an adverse decision as to the priority of our inventions 
we are currently involved in multiple interference and or opposition proceedings with regard to gene activation technology  certain ex vivo gene therapies  certain vector technologies  and chimeric receptor technology 
we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 
an adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our intellectual property position in these areas and on our business as a whole 
we may be involved in other interference and or opposition proceedings in the future 
we believe that there will continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
our competitive positions may be adversely affected by our limited ability to protect and control unpatented trade secrets  know how and other technological innovation 
our competitors may independently develop similar or better proprietary information and techniques and disclose them publicly 
also  others may gain access to our trade secrets  and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets 
we require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us 
these agreements provide that all confidential information developed by or made known to an individual during the course of the employment or consulting relationship generally must be kept confidential 
in the case of employees  the agreements provide that all inventions relating to our business conceived by the employee while employed by us are our exclusive property 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly than we do  which may adversely affect our competitive position 
there are approximately companies worldwide pursuing cancer programs with similar technology to ours 
some of these competitors are large pharmaceutical companies  such as aventis and glaxosmithkline  which have greater experience and resources than we do in developing products  in undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products  in obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of products  and in manufacturing and marketing new therapies 
we are also competing with other biotechnology companies with similar experience and resources to ours  but who may have programs which are in a later stage of clinical testing than ours  such as dendreon corporation 
however  our competitive position and that of our competitors can vary based on the performance of products in clinical trials 
in addition  our competitors may obtain patent protection or fda approval and commercialize products more rapidly than we do  which may impact future sales of our products 
we also may not have the access that some of our competitors have to biological materials necessary to support the research  development or manufacturing of planned therapies 
if we are permitted by the fda to commence commercial sales of products  we will also be competing with respect to marketing capabilities and manufacturing efficiency  areas in which we have limited or no experience 
we expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based  among other things  on product efficacy  price  safety  reliability  availability  patent protection  and sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
our competitive position also depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  develop proprietary products or processes  and secure sufficient funding for the often lengthy period between product conception and commercial sales 
to the extent we depend on strategic partners to sell  market or distribute our products  we will have reduced control over the success of the sales  marketing and distribution of our future products 
we have no experience in sales  marketing or distribution of biopharmaceutical products 
we may in the future rely on sales and marketing expertise of potential corporate partners for our initial products 
the decision to market future products directly or through corporate partners will be based on a number of factors  including market size and concentration  size and expertise of the partner s sales force in a particular market  and our overall strategic objectives 
we may in the future be exposed to product liability claims  which could adversely affect our business  results of operation  financial condition and cash flow 
clinical trials or marketing of any of our potential products may expose us to liability claims resulting from the use of our products 
these claims might be made by consumers  health care providers or sellers of our products 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with respect to each of our clinical trials 
we may not be able to maintain insurance or obtain sufficient coverage at a reasonable cost  given the increasing cost of insurance in today s insurance market 
an inability to maintain insurance at an acceptable cost  or at all  could prevent or inhibit the clinical testing or commercialization of our products or otherwise affect our financial condition 
a claim  particularly resulting from a clinical trial  on any of our insurance policies or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer as a result of our strategic acquisitions and investments 
in january  we acquired the principal operating assets of chiron corporation s gene therapy business  a fully equipped and staffed manufacturing facility 
also in january  we launched ceregene  inc  formed through the acquisition of neurologic gene therapeutics  a private san diego based start up company 
finally  in september  we acquired calydon  inc  a private biotechnology company focused on the treatment of cancer using genetically engineered oncolytic virus therapies 
we may not be able to fully integrate all these companies and their intellectual property or personnel 
our attempts to do so will place additional burdens on our management and infrastructure 
these acquisitions will also subject us to a number of risks  including the loss of key personnel and business relationships  difficulties associated with assimilating and integrating the new personnel and operations of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the expense associated with maintenance of diverse standards  controls  procedures  employees and clients  the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology  and our inability to generate revenue from acquired technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs 
we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with our acquisitions 
moreover  we may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute our existing stockholders or cause us to incur contingent liabilities  debt or significant expense 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions or investments in related businesses  products or technologies 
we may not be successful with any strategic acquisition or investment 
any future acquisition or investment could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist activity and other events beyond our control  which could result in a material adverse effect on our business 
our facilities in california have  in the past  been subject to electrical blackouts as a result of a shortage of available electrical power 
future blackouts could disrupt the operations of our facilities 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for actual losses from interruption of our business that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we depend on our key technical and management personnel and clinical investigative sites to advance our technology  and the loss of these personnel or partners could impair the development of our products 
we rely and will continue to rely on our key management and scientific staff 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to recruit necessary additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
there is intense competition from other companies  research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we will need to continue to recruit experts in the areas of clinical testing  manufacturing  marketing and distribution and to develop additional expertise in our existing personnel 
if we do not succeed in recruiting necessary personnel or developing this expertise  our business could suffer significantly 
we have clinical trial agreements with a number of public and private medical institutions for the conduct of human clinical trials for our gvax cancer vaccine programs and oncolytic virus therapies 
the early termination of any of these clinical trial agreements would hinder the progress of our clinical trial program 
if any of these relationships are terminated  the clinical trials might not be completed and the results might not be evaluated 
inventions or processes discovered by our outside scientific collaborators may not become our property  which may affect our competitive position 
we rely on the continued availability of outside scientific collaborators performing research 
these relationships generally may be terminated at any time by the collaborator  typically by giving days notice 
these scientific collaborators are not our employees 
as a result  we have limited control over their activities and can expect that only limited amounts of their time will be dedicated to our activities 
our agreements with these collaborators  as well as those with our scientific consultants  provide that any rights we obtain as a result of their research efforts will be subject to the rights of the research institutions for which they work 
in addition  some of these collaborators have consulting or other advisory arrangements with other entities that may conflict with their obligations to us 
for these reasons  inventions or processes discovered by our scientific collaborators or consultants may not become our property 
our stock price is influenced by the market price of abgenix stock  which has been highly volatile 
our retained ownership of abgenix common stock represents a material portion of the total assets on our balance sheet 
abgenix stock price has proven to be highly volatile 
the value of our of abgenix common stock was approximately million at december  versus approximately million at december  movements in the price of abgenix stock  up or down  may exert corresponding influences on the market price of our stock 
our stock price has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
the stock prices of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies including cell genesys have historically been highly volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated during the past two years between a high close price of on december  and a low close price of on march  the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the following factors may affect our stock price fluctuations in our financial results  announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by us or our competitors  announcements of changes in governmental regulation affecting us or our competitors  announcements of regulatory approval or disapproval of our or our competitors products  developments in patent or other proprietary rights affecting us or our competitors  public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  general market conditions  fluctuations in the price of abgenix stock  as described above  severe fluctuations in price and volume in the stock market in general or in the trading of the stock of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular that are unrelated to our operating performance  issuances of common stock upon conversion of our series b preferred stock  sales of common stock by us or by existing stockholders  and the perception that such issuances or sales could occur 
our stockholders may be diluted by the conversion of outstanding series b redeemable convertible preferred stock 
as of december   shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock issued in january remained outstanding and were convertible into an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock as of that date 
the holders of the series b preferred may choose at any time to convert their shares into common stock 
conversion of the series b preferred would result in issuance of additional shares of common stock  diluting existing stockholders 
the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred is determined by dividing the market value of the shares to be converted by the lower of a fixed conversion price of per share subject to antidilution provisions  or the average of certain trading prices during the trading days preceding such date of conversion 
the market value of the series b preferred is based on the outstanding carrying value from the original issuance plus the deemed dividend earned over the holding period 
as of december   the aggregate market value for all outstanding series b preferred was approximately million 
the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred  and therefore the dilution of existing investors  would increase as a result of either an event triggering the antidilution rights of the series b preferred or a decline in the market price of our common stock immediately prior to conversion of the series b preferred 
in the event the holders of the remaining outstanding series b preferred do not convert their shares  the shares will automatically be converted on january  according to the formula described above 
our stockholders may be diluted by the exercise of outstanding stock options or other issuances of our common stock 
substantially all our outstanding shares of common stock are eligible for sale in the public market 
issuance of common stock or the exercise of stock options would dilute existing investors 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of us or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
these provisions include the adoption of a stockholder rights plan  commonly known as a poison pill 
under the stockholders rights plan  stockholders of record on august  received one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of our common stock 
in july  we made certain technical changes to amend the plan and extended the term of such plan until the rights are exercisable only if an acquirer purchases percent or more of our common stock or announces a tender offer for percent or more of our common stock 
upon exercise  holders other than the acquirer may purchase our stock at a discount 
the board of directors may terminate the rights plan at any time or under certain circumstances redeem the rights 
because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over with out the approval of the board of directors  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock with out first negotiating with our board of directors regarding such acquisition 
these provisions and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of cell genesys  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the fair market value of our common stock 
risks related to our industry in order for our products to be offered to the public  they must undergo extensive clinical testing and receive approval from the food and drug administration  which could delay or prevent the commercialization of our products 
human therapeutic products must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other premarket approval procedures by the fda and similar authorities in foreign countries 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of potential products and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product and its formulations 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
clinical trials are conducted in accordance with fda good clinical practices under protocols that detail the objectives of the study  the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated 
the developer of the drug must provide information relating to the characterization of the product after administration to the patients participating in the clinical trials 
this requires developing approved assays of the product to test before and after administration to the patient 
the results of the preclinical testing and clinical testing  together with chemistry  manufacturing and controls information  are submitted to the fda in the form of a new drug application for a pharmaceutical product  and in the form of a biologics license application for a biological product  requesting approval to commence commercial sales 
in responding to a new drug application or a biologics license application  the fda may grant marketing approvals  request additional information or further research  or deny the application if it determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria 
approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  if at all  and if granted may not cover all the clinical indications for which we are seeking approval 
also  an approval might contain significant limitations in the form of warnings  precautions or contraindications with respect to conditions of use 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations  and complying with these may cause us to incur significant costs 
we are subject to laws and regulations enforced by the fda  the california department of health services  the tennessee board of pharmacy and other regulatory statutes including occupational safety and health act  environmental protection act  toxic substances control act  resource conservation and recovery act  and other current and potential future federal  state or local laws and regulations 
in particular with respect to environmental laws  product development activities involve the use of hazardous materials  and we may incur significant costs as a result of the need to comply with these laws 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  viruses and radioactive compounds 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury  by accident or as the results of intentional acts of terrorists  from these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any resulting liability could exceed our resources 
we may also be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future 
failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs and devices could prevent us from selling our products in foreign markets  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
for marketing outside the united states  the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country 
failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or obtain required approvals could impair our ability to develop these markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our competitors may develop therapies for the diseases that we are targeting that are more advanced or more effective than ours  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
competition in the field from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and from research and academic institutions is intense and expected to increase 
in many instances  we compete with other commercial entities in acquiring products or technology from universities 
there are numerous competitors working on products to treat each of the diseases for which we are seeking to develop therapeutic products 
some competitors are pursuing a product development strategy competitive with ours  particularly with respect to our cancer vaccine and oncolytic virus therapy programs 
certain of these competitive products are in more advanced stages of product development and clinical trials 
we compete with other clinical stage companies and institutions for clinical study participants  which could reduce our ability to recruit participants for our clinical trials 
delay in recruiting clinical study participants could adversely affect our ability to bring a product to market prior to our competitors 
our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than ours  or that would render our technology and products less competitive or obsolete 
reimbursement from third party payers may become more restricted in the future  which may reduce demand for our products 
sales of our future products will be influenced by the willingness of third party payers to provide reimbursement 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our potential products will depend in part upon coverage and reimbursement from third party payers  including government agencies  private health care insurers and other health care payers such as health maintenance organizations  self insured employee plans  and blue cross blue shield and similar plans 
there is considerable pressure to reduce the cost of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products 
reimbursement from government agencies  insurers and large health organizations may become more restricted in the future 
our potential products represent a new mode of therapy  and while the cost benefit ratio of the products may be favorable  we expect that the costs associated with our products will be substantial 
our proposed products  if successfully developed  may not be considered cost effective by third party payers 
insurance coverage might not be provided by third party payers at all or without substantial delay 
even if such coverage is provided  the approved reimbursement might not provide sufficient funds to enable us to become profitable 
the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare may impair our future revenues and profitability 
the pricing of our future products may be influenced in part by government controls 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government control 
while we cannot predict whether the government will adopt any such legislative or regulatory proposals  the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow
