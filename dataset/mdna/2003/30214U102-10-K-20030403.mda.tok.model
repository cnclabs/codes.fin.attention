item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the statements in this report that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements and are based on current expectations and actual results may differ materially 
these forward looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially  including but not limited to  the possibility that the demand for our services may decline as a result of changes in general and industry specific economic conditions and the effects of competitive services and pricing  one or more current or future claims made against us may result in substantial liabilities  and such other risks and uncertainties as are described in reports and other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
overview exponent  inc is a science and engineering consulting firm that provides solutions to complex problems 
our multidisciplinary team of scientists  physicians  engineers and business consultants brings together more than different technical disciplines to solve complicated issues facing industry and government today 
our services include analysis of product development or product recall  regulatory compliance  discovery of potential problems related to products  people or property and impending litigation  as well as the development of highly technical new products 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and judgments  which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  income taxes  and contingencies such as litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are 
table of contents reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes  valuing long lived assets under sfas no 
 valuing goodwill under sfas no 
 and accounting for stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues primarily from professional fees earned on consulting engagements and fees earned for the use of our equipment and facilities  as well as reimbursements for outside direct expenses associated with the services that are billed to our clients in accordance with eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  we report revenue net of subcontractor fees 
we have determined that we are not the primary obligors with respect to our subcontractors because our clients are directly involved in the subcontractor selection process  the subcontractor is responsible for fulfilling the scope of work  and we pass through the costs of subcontractor agreements with only a minimal fixed percentage mark up to compensate us for processing the transactions 
in accordance with eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  reimbursements  including those related to travel and other out of pocket expenses  and other similar third party costs such as the cost of materials  are included in revenues  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses are included in operating expenses 
any mark up on reimbursable expenses is included in revenues 
the majority of our engagements are performed under time and material or fixed price billing arrangements 
on time and material and fixed price projects  revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed 
for our fixed price engagements we recognize revenue based on the relationship of incurred labor hours at standard rates to our estimate of the total labor hours at standard rates we expect to incur over the term of the contract 
we believe this methodology achieves a reliable measure of the revenue from the consulting services we provide to our customers under fixed price contracts given the nature of the consulting services we provide and the following additional considerations we consider labor hours at standard rates and expenses to be incurred when pricing our contracts  we generally do not incur set up costs on our contracts  we do not believe that there are reliable milestones to measure progress toward completion  if either party terminates the contract early  the customer is required to pay us for time at standard rates plus materials incurred to date  we do not recognize revenue for award fees or bonuses until specific contractual criteria are met  we do not include revenue for un priced change orders until the customer agrees with the changes  historically we have not had significant accounts receivable write offs or cost overruns  and our contracts are typically progress billed on a monthly basis 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
these judgments and estimates include an assessment of collectibility and  for fixed price engagements  an estimate as to the total effort required to complete the project 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue for any period could be materially different 
all consulting contracts are subject to review by senior management  which requires a positive assessment of the collectibility of contract amounts 
if  during the course of the contract  we determine that collection of revenue is not reasonably assured  we do not recognize the revenue until its collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client and project manager  as well as the credit worthiness of the client 
losses on fixed price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes evident 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total costs of the contract exceeds the total fixed price of the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of our ability to collect accounts receivable 
table of contents and our unbilled work in process 
specifically  we analyze billed accounts receivable and unbilled work in process based upon historical bad debts  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic conditions and changes in customer payment terms when determining the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of january   our accounts receivable balance was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
accounting for income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we must include an expense within the tax provision of the statement of income in each period in which the allowance is increased 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods  then we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
based on our current financial projections and operating plan for fiscal  we currently believe that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax asset 
as of january   we had net deferred tax assets of million and net long term deferred tax liabilities of  for a net deferred tax asset of million and a valuation allowance of valuing long lived assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that long lived assets are reviewed whenever indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the related asset 
for long lived assets to be held and used  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
the loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets 
for long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale  an impairment loss is recognized at the date the long lived asset is exchanged 
long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale are classified as held for sale  depreciation ceases and such assets are valued at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
as of january   we did not have any long lived assets to be disposed of by sale or other than by sale and there has been no indication of impairments to our long lived assets 
our long lived assets  consisting primarily of net property  equipment and leasehold improvements  totaled million at january  valuing goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 
factors that we consider when evaluating for possible impairment include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative economic trends 
when evaluating the company s goodwill for impairment  based upon the existence of one or more of the above factors  we determine the existence of an impairment by assessing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit  including goodwill  using expected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss is recognized 
as of january   goodwill totaled million 
we adopted sfas no 
effective december  as a result we ceased amortizing goodwill  which had a balance of approximately million and million at january  and december   respectively 
in place of amortization  this statement requires an annual impairment review beginning in fiscal we completed our impairment review and determined that we had no impairment of our goodwill and therefore did not record an impairment charge 
during the first quarter of fiscal  there was an increase of  in goodwill due to a payout related to a prior acquisition 
in addition  we acquired novigen 
table of contents sciences  inc novigen on may  as required by sfas no 
 we allocated the purchase price to the assets  liabilities and goodwill acquired  based on the fair value at the date of acquisition 
we recorded million in goodwill associated with this acquisition  which will not be amortized but rather tested annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no

our fiscal revenues were million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
fiscal was a week year in which we earned approximately million in revenues before reimbursements during this extra week 
our revenue increase over last year was the result of growth in both of our business segments 
our environmental and health segment contributed million of the increase and our other scientific and engineering segment contributed million 
growth in our environmental and health segment was primarily the result of increased billable hours  billing rates and the acquisition of novigen sciences  inc novigen on may  the novigen acquisition contributed million to this segment s revenue growth 
also in our environmental and health segment  the health and epidemiology and human health risk assessment practices grew by million or over the prior year  which was partially offset by decreased revenues of million from our environmental practices 
growth in our other scientific and engineering segment was the result of increased billable hours and billing rates 
within our other scientific and engineering segment  our civil engineering  mechanical engineering and materials science  biomechanics and thermal sciences practices grew a combined million or  which was partially offset by decreased revenues of million or in our technology development business 
we continued to see a decline in revenues in related to the land warrior projects for the us army as it continued in its pre production phase 

table of contents this contract was concluded in the first quarter of fiscal in august  we were awarded the phase i objective force warrior agreement and we anticipate that we will realize revenues before reimbursements of approximately million related to this contract during the first half of fiscal fiscal revenues were million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
the increase was the result of growth in our environmental and health segment during the year 
revenues for our environmental and health segment increased million during the year 
our other scientific and engineering segment s revenues decreased in fiscal by  growth in our environmental and health segment was primarily the result of increases in bill rates and billed hours 
compared with the prior fiscal year  the health and epidemiology practice within our environmental and health segment  experienced growth of million or 
in  our other scientific and engineering segment had lower revenues from our technology development practice s land warrior program as compared to the prior year 
the land warrior project experienced lower revenues due to our entering the pre production phase of the program  which required a reduced effort by exponent compared to last year 
in addition  this segment s vehicle analysis practice  which derives most of its business from the automotive industry  also experienced a decline compared to fiscal  due to the weakened economy 
compensation and related expenses during fiscal  total compensation and related expenses were million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the effect of annual salary increases  the novigen acquisition and increased bonus expense 
the novigen acquisition increased our staff by full time employees and compensation expense by million or 
we expect an additional million in compensation expense in fiscal as a result of this acquisition 
bonus expense increased by million or  as a result of our increased profitability 
these increases over last year were partially offset by a staff reduction  primarily in the vehicle analysis and technology development practices  by full time employees in the first quarter of fiscal as a percentage of revenue  compensation and related expenses increased to as compared to in fiscal fiscal compensation and related expense was million  which increased by million or over the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the effect of annual salary increases and increased employee health insurance costs over the prior year 
the increase was partially offset by decreased bonus expense  which is based on our profitability 
additionally  on june   we reduced our staff by seventeen full time employees and nine contract employees  most of whom were located at our test and engineering center in phoenix 
as a percentage of revenue  compensation and related expenses increased to as compared to in fiscal other operating expenses fiscal other operating expenses were million  which increased by  or over the prior year  as a result of increased rent expense of  partially offset by reduced depreciation of  and other occupancy expenses of  rent increased as a result of three newly acquired novigen offices  the relocation of three existing offices and new lease agreements in several other locations 
depreciation decreased due to personal computer and software assets becoming fully depreciated and fewer assets capitalized as a result of lower unit acquisition costs 
other occupancy costs decreased due primarily to lower repair and maintenance costs in fiscal compared to last year 
we anticipate incremental other operating expense increases related to the novigen acquisition of approximately  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  other operating expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal other operating expenses were million  which increased by  or over the prior year as a result of increased facilities and occupancy costs  partially offset by reduced office expenses 
we relocated our orange county office to a larger facility in irvine and added additional space in our seattle and san diego locations 
additionally  we experienced increases in our utility costs  primarily in our silicon valley and phoenix locations 
these increases were partially offset by decreased office expenses  as a result of our reduced spending in the areas of office furniture  supplies and shipping 
additionally  our engineering and test preparation building located in phoenix was completed at the end of fiscal  which increased depreciation in fiscal over the prior year 
as a percentage of revenues  other operating expense increased to in fiscal from in fiscal 
table of contents reimbursable expenses fiscal reimbursable expenses were million  which increased by  or over the prior year due primarily to increases in outside direct expenses for vehicle procurements related to services performed on projects primarily in our vehicle analysis practice 
as a percentage of revenues  reimbursable expenses decreased to from in fiscal fiscal reimbursable expenses were million  which decreased by million or over fiscal the decrease was primarily in materials and technical supplies expense and was due to reduced effort on the land warrior program compared to the prior year 
in fiscal  reimbursable expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues to from in fiscal general and administrative expenses fiscal general and administrative expenses were million  which decreased by million or over the prior year due to decreases in goodwill amortization of  taxes and licenses of  outside consulting of  and employee relocation expenses of  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in marketing expense of  with the adoption of sfas no 
 at the beginning of fiscal  we are no longer amortizing goodwill 
the decrease in tax and licenses expense resulted from a favorable settlement of a sales tax assessment  which we had previously recorded as an expense 
our outside consulting expenses decreased primarily due to the reduced effort on the land warrior program compared to the prior year 
the novigen acquisition is expected to incrementally increase general and administrative expenses by approximately  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal general and administrative expenses were million  which decreased by  or over the prior year due to decreases in bad debt expense of  sales tax of  and temporary employee expenses of  the decreases were partially offset by increases in travel costs of  outside consulting of  and amortization of goodwill and other intangibles of  bad debt expense decreased primarily as a result of improved accounts receivable collections 
additionally  we recovered approximately  in previously written off accounts in the second quarter of the decrease in sales tax is related to a lower accrual for this expense in fiscal as compared to the prior year

liquidity and capital resources exponent financed its business in fiscal principally through cash available and cash flows from operating activities 
we invest our excess cash in cash equivalents 
at the end of fiscal  we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at the end of the prior year 
we also maintain a revolving reducing mortgage note  secured by our headquarters building 
as of january   our available borrowings under this mortgage note were million and the outstanding balance was 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities over the prior year was largely due to increased net income and improved collections in accounts receivable 
accounts receivable related cash flow improved as a result of lowered days sales outstanding  which were reduced to days in fiscal compared to days in the prior year 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal relative to fiscal was largely due to decreased net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities  particularly the increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to revenue growth in fiscal and the longer billing cycle on us government contracts compared to the prior year 
in addition  accrued payroll and employee benefits decreased as compared to an increase in the prior year 
this decrease resulted from a reduced bonus  which is calculated based on profitability  which was lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal deferred revenues increased in fiscal  but not to the same extent as the increase in fiscal  which resulted in reduced cash flow in the current year as compared to fiscal in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily the result of cash paid for novigen in the amount of million 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily the result of reduced capital expenditures related to the completion  in october  of our engineering and test preparation building at our test and engineering center in phoenix 
in addition  we sold the assets of bcs wireless  inc in fiscal  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million  which was partially offset by cash used to acquire lockwood singh on september  in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was million compared to net cash used of million in the prior year 
this change was the result of a net issuance of common stock of million compared to net repurchases of million in the prior year 
net issuance of common stock was primarily related to the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was due to a reduction in repayments on long term borrowings and reduced repurchases of common stock  net of proceeds from issuance of common stock 
the reduction in borrowings on our revolving reducing mortgage note resulted from our ability to use existing cash at the end of fiscal and cash flows generated by fiscal operating activities to finance current operations 
at january   our long term obligations were  compared to  in the prior year 
the fiscal and balances consisted of the following fiscal years in thousands insurance financing capital leases deferred compensation less current installments long term obligations  net of current portion as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following is a summary of our commitments to make future payments under contracts 
the following table summarizes our future minimum payments  net of rental income  required under non cancelable operating leases  with terms in excess of one year as of january  in thousands year ending lease commitments rental income net future payments thereafter we have a revolving reducing mortgage note with a total available borrowing amount of million and an outstanding balance of as of march  we believe that our existing revolving note  together with funds generated from operations  will provide adequate cash to fund our anticipated cash needs through at least the next twelve month period 
additionally  we believe that the funds available under the revolving reducing mortgage note  together 
table of contents with funds generated from operations  will provide adequate cash to fund our anticipated long term cash needs beyond the next twelve month period  however  we intend to grow our business by pursuing potential acquisitions  which could increase the need for additional sources of funds over the long term 
factors that may affect future operating results and market price of stock exponent operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
these uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those mentioned elsewhere in this report and the following absence of backlog revenues are primarily derived from services provided in response to client requests or events that occur without notice  and engagements  generally billed as services are performed  are terminable or subject to postponement or delay at any time by clients 
as a result  backlog at any particular time is small in relation to our quarterly or annual revenues and is not a reliable indicator of revenues for any future periods 
revenues and operating margins for any particular quarter are generally affected by staffing mix  resource requirements and timing and size of engagements 
attraction and retention of key employees exponent s business involves the delivery of professional services and is labor intensive 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
qualified personnel are in demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
we cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to attract sufficient numbers of highly qualified technical and managerial personnel and to retain existing employees 
the loss of a significant number of our employees could have a material adverse impact on our business  including our ability to secure and complete engagements 
competition the markets for our services are highly competitive 
in addition  there are relatively low barriers to entry into our markets and we have faced  and expect to continue to face  additional competition from new entrants into our markets 
competitive pressure could reduce the market acceptance of our services and result in price reductions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
customer concentration we currently derive and believe that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients  organizations and insurers related to the transportation industry 
transportation industry related engagements accounted for approximately of our gross revenues for the fiscal year ended january  in addition  we performed engagements for the government sector  which accounted for approximately of our gross revenues for the fiscal year ended january  the loss of any large client  organization or insurer related to either the transportation industry or government sector could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
economic uncertainty the markets that we serve are cyclical and subject to general economic conditions 
if the economy in which we operate  which is predominately in the us  were to experience a prolonged slowdown  demand for our services could be reduced considerably 
regulation public concern over health  safety and preservation of the environment has resulted in the enactment of a broad range of environmental laws and regulations by local  state and federal lawmakers and agencies 
these laws and the implementing regulations affect nearly every industry  as well as the agencies of federal  state and local governments charged with their enforcement 
to the extent changes in such laws  regulations and enforcement or other factors significantly reduce the exposures of manufacturers  owners  service providers and others to liability  the demand for our environmental services may be significantly reduced 
variability of quarterly financial results variations in our revenues and operating results occur from time to time  as a result of a number of factors  such as the significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter  the number of working days in a quarter  employee hiring and utilization rates  and integration of companies acquired 
because a high percentage of our expenses  particularly personnel and facilities related  are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter  a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of our client assignments  at or near the end of any quarter  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk exponent has a revolving reducing mortgage note the mortgage note secured by our silicon valley headquarters building 
the mortgage note  which had an initial borrowing amount up to million  is subject to automatic annual reductions in the amount available to be borrowed of between million to million approximately per year until january  as of january   we had outstanding balance and available borrowings of million 
any outstanding amounts on the mortgage note are due and payable in full on january  we may from time to time during the term of the mortgage note borrow  partially or wholly repay our outstanding borrowings and re borrow up to the maximum principal amounts  subject to the reductions in availability contained in the note 
the mortgage note is also subject to two interest rate options of either prime less or the fixed libor plus with a term option of one month  two months  three months  six months  nine months  or twelve months 
interest will be paid on a monthly basis 
principal amounts subject to the prime interest rate may be repaid at any time without penalty 
principal amounts subject to the fixed libor rate may also be repaid at any time but are subject to a prepayment penalty if paid before the fixed rate term  or additional interest if paid after the fixed rate term 
we are exposed to some interest rate risk associated with the mortgage note 
our general policy for selecting among the interest rate options and related terms will be to minimize interest expense 
however  given the risk of interest rate fluctuations  we cannot be certain that the lowest rate option will always be obtained  thereby consistently minimizing our interest expense 
no sensitivity analysis was performed on our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  however  given the historical low volatility of both the prime and libor interest rates  we believe that any exposure would be minimal 
we are exposed to some interest rate risk associated with our balances of cash and cash equivalents 
given the historical low volatility of interest rates on these balances  we believe that any exposure would be minimal 
we are exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 
given the limited nature of these operations and the historical low volatility of such exchange rates  we believe that any exposure would be minimal
