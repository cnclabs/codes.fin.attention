on october   the stockholders of the corporation approved the plan of liquidation 
as a result  the corporation adopted liquidation accounting and the operating partnership has been seeking  and will seek  to sell its remaining properties at such time as it is believed that the sale price for such property can be maximized 
since the adoption of the plan of liquidation  the corporation has sold its properties located in fort lauderdale  florida and new york  new york and has paid dividends of per share including a dividend of per share paid in january and of per share paid in march 
in addition  its property located in san diego  california is under contract for sale 
pursuant to the plan of liquidation  if all of the assets of the corporation are not sold prior to october   the remaining assets will be placed in a liquidating trust and the stockholders of the corporation will receive a beneficial interest in such trust in total redemption for their shares in the corporation 
the corporation is operating with the intention of qualifying as a real estate investment trust for us federal income tax purposes reit under sections of the internal revenue code of as amended 
under those sections  a reit which pays at least of its ordinary taxable income as a dividend to its stockholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders 
we have adopted a plan of liquidation that requires us to liquidate all of our assets and liabilities by october  distributions made by us to you and our other stockholders during our liquidation generally will not be taxable to you until the distributions exceed your adjusted tax basis in your shares  and then will be taxable to you as long term capital gain assuming you hold your shares as capital assets and have held them for more than months when you receive the distribution as a result of the adoption of the plan of liquidation 
if our assets are not completely liquidated by october   our assets will be transferred to a liquidating trust on such date and in lieu of owning shares  you will own a beneficial interest in the liquidating trust of an equivalent percentage 
the transferability of interests in the trust will be significantly restricted as compared to the shares in the corporation  and you will be required to include in your own income your pro rata share of the trust s taxable income whether or not that amount is actually distributed by the trust to you in that year 
as a result of the adoption of the plan of liquidation  our primary business objective is to maximize the value of our common stock 
prior to october   we sought to achieve this objective by managing our existing properties  making capital improvements to and or selling properties and by making additional real estate related investments 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
real estate held for sale and adjustment to liquidation basis of accounting on october   in accordance with the liquidation basis of accounting  assets were adjusted to estimated net realizable value and liabilities were adjusted to estimated settlement amounts  including estimated costs associated with carrying out the liquidation 
the valuation of investments in joint ventures and real estate held for sale is based on current contracts  estimates as determined by independent appraisals or other indications of sales value  net of estimated selling costs including brokerage commissions  transfer taxes  legal costs and capital expenditures of approximately  anticipated during the liquidation period 
the valuations of other assets and liabilities are based on management s estimates as of december  the actual values realized for assets and settlement of liabilities may differ materially from amounts estimated 
the net adjustment at october   required to convert from the going concern historical cost basis to the liquidation basis of accounting  totaled  which is included in the consolidated statement of changes in net assets liquidation basis for the period october  to december  significant increases decreases in the carrying value of net assets are summarized as follows increase to reflect estimated net realizable values of certain real estate properties  deferral of appreciated gain and incentive fee on real estate properties  increase to reflect net realizable value of investments in joint ventures  deferral of appreciated gain and incentive fee on investments in joint ventures  reserve for additional costs associated with liquidation  write off of deferred debt costs  adjustment to reflect the change to liquidation basis of accounting  such costs do not include costs incurred in connection with ordinary operations 
adjusting assets to estimated net realizable value resulted in the adjustment in value of certain real estate properties 
the anticipated gains associated with the write up of these real estate properties have been deferred until such time as a sale occurs 
reserve for estimated costs during the period of liquidation under liquidation accounting  the corporation is required to estimate and accrue the non operating costs associated with executing the plan of liquidation 
these amounts can vary significantly due to  among other things  the timing and realized proceeds from property sales  the costs of retaining agents and trustees to oversee the liquidation  the non operating costs of insurance  the timing and amounts associated with discharging known and contingent liabilities and the costs associated with cessation of the corporation s operations 
these non operating costs are estimates and are expected to be paid out over the liquidation period 
such costs do not include costs incurred in connection with ordinary operations 
investments in joint ventures certain properties are owned in joint ventures with shelbourne properties ii lp and or shelbourne properties iii lp prior to april   the corporation owned an undivided interest in the assets owned by these joint ventures and was severally liable for indebtedness it incurred in connection with its ownership interest in those properties 
therefore  for periods prior to april   the corporation s consolidated financial statements had presented the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses of the joint ventures on a pro rata basis in accordance with the corporation s percentage of ownership 
after april   as a result of the operating partnership incurring debt in connection with entering into the note payable discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements annexed hereto  the corporation was no longer allowed to account for its investments in joint ventures on a pro rata consolidation basis in accordance with its percentage of ownership but must instead utilize the equity method of accounting
