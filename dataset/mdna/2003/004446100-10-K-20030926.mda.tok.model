item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of this annual report on form k and the information incorporated by reference may include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
the company intends the forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements 
all statements regarding the company s expected financial position and operating results  its business strategy  its financing plans and the outcome of any contingencies are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are based on current estimates and projections about our industry and our business 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth or implied by any forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to unforeseen environmental liabilities and the uncertain military  political and economic conditions in the world 
these risks are detailed in part i  item risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
the company assumes no obligation to update publicly the forward looking statements contained herein  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as may be required by law 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on a regular basis  including those related to bad debts  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  and environmental contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on various factors including historical experience  consultation and advice from third party subject matter experts and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title and risk of loss to the customer 
such revenues do not involve difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
the company does not offer product warranties to its customers 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical experience and known factors regarding specific customers and industries in which the customers operate 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
the company writes down its inventories for estimated slow moving and obsolete goods equal to the difference between the carrying cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a significant sudden increase in the demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may have understated or overstated the write down required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if the company s inventory is determined to be overvalued  it would be required to recognize such costs in its cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if the company does not properly estimate the lower of cost or market of its inventory and it is therefore determined to be undervalued  it may have over reported its cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and its reported operating results 
goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets 
other intangible assets principally consist of purchased customer lists and covenants not to compete 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  effective july  as required by sfas  the company upon adoption performed impairment tests on goodwill as of july  as a result of the impairment tests  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  which has been included as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended june  also required by sfas  on an annual basis  the company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing 
in making these assumptions and estimates  the company uses industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
additionally  the company utilizes the assistance of a third party valuation firm  as necessary  to help evaluate recorded goodwill 
if the estimates or their related assumptions used by the company change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the company establishes reserves for environmental matters and other contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
if the contingency is resolved for an amount greater or less than has been accrued  or the company s share of the contingency increases or decreases  or other assumptions relevant to the development of the estimate were to change  the company would recognize an additional expense or benefit in income in the period such determination was made 
the company has accounted for  and currently accounts for  income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   the company has current net deferred tax assets of and non current net deferred tax assets of  these net deferred tax assets have been recorded based on the company having sufficient future earnings in order to realize these assets  and the net deferred tax assets have been provided for at currently enacted income tax rates 
included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately  which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date 
management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction 
based on the company s assessments  no additional valuation allowance is required 
if the company determines that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time 
furthermore  the company provides reserves for federal  state and international tax exposures relating to audits  planning initiatives  and compliance responsibilities 
the development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues  potential outcomes and timing  and is a subjective critical estimate

this segment has achieved gains in market share and experienced strong demand for certain active pharmaceutical ingredients of products launched during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the four quarters of fiscal this segment s sales were  for the year ended june  versus  last year  an increase of  or 
a majority of the increase resulted from the initial and follow up shipments of several generic pharmaceutical products which are sold to companies who have received recent approval to market these products 
in addition  the increase was attributable to increased sales volume from an expanded distribution agreement with a major supplier which allows for the sale of additional products into new markets 
the nutritionals business showed a increase in volume this year due to increased demand for products such as nutritional supplements 
the chemicals colorants segment achieved an increase of  or  to  in compared to  last year

institutional sanitary supplies other sales were  for compared to  last year  an increase of or 
the improved sales were attributable to price increases and identifying better sources of supply that have improved our competitive position regarding pricing

the gross profit resulting from the health sciences segment amounted to  or in fiscal versus  or in the prior year 
gross profit improvement was mainly attributable to the sales of several generic pharmaceutical products as described above in the sales comments 
these products provided substantial increases in gross profit dollars at a slightly higher gross margin rate 
gross profit improvement was also attributable to the increased volume from an expanded distribution agreement with a major supplier for new products in both existing and new markets 
in addition  nutritionals also achieved a gross profit increase this year in dollars as a result of increased demand at similar margin rates 
the chemicals colorants segment s gross profit of  decreased or over last year s  gross profit  as a percentage of sales  declined to this year versus 
the current year s gross profit includes the net benefit of a negotiated settlement for lost gross profit regarding non performance of a sales contract and an estimate of a loss on the related purchase contract in the amount of the decrease in gross profit excluding this favorable settlement would have been  or 
the gross profit rate for this year would have been excluding the settlement which is lower than the gross profit rate in the prior year of 
the decrease in gross profit rate is primarily a result of increased sales volume from one large customer at lower than usual gross profit rates which has been combined with continued erosion of margins and gross profit dollars in various business sectors due to competitive pressures and economic sluggishness 
the loss of several large customers in early fiscal also contributed to the decrease in gross profit dollars 
the agrochemicals segment showed a decrease in gross profit of or from  in fiscal versus  last year 
the decrease in gross profit dollars resulted from increased packaging costs and overall product mix offset by an increase in sales volume 
gross margin was in fiscal versus last year 
institutional sanitary supplies and other gross profits were  or in versus  or in the increase in gross profit dollars is mainly a result of a increase in sales 
overall product mix and price increases were the main reasons for the higher margins this year 
unallocated cost of sales increased to  from  or 
the higher costs were mainly a result of higher freight costs due to rising fuel surcharges  increased sales and shipments to customers and higher amounts of inventory in warehouses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or to  for fiscal from  for fiscal as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to for fiscal versus for fiscal sg a increased primarily due to rising business insurance costs  increased selling expenses and overall increases in employee wages  incentive compensation and fringe benefit costs

short term bank loans was  at june  versus  at june  there was no acquisition related debt remaining as of june  and interest and other income increased to for fiscal compared to last year 
interest income increased this year due to higher average balances in interest bearing accounts and increased finance charges received from a major customer 
miscellaneous sources of other income realized an increase of in versus the prior year 
this was offset by a reduction in dividend income of and a loss on marketable securities of this year compared to a loss of in the prior year 
tax rates the effective tax rate for the year ended june  decreased to from last year

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle the year ended june  includes a one time charge of  or per diluted share  attributable to the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company s  one time charge was related to the impairment of the goodwill associated with cdc products corp 
cdc which is part of our institutional sanitary supply segment 
the one time charge for cdc was primarily due to recent operating profits and cash flows being lower than expected due to increased competition from local sanitary supply companies in the markets cdc operates

the acquisition in march contributed sales of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the segment s sales  excluding the schweizerhall pharma portion  were  in versus  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was a direct result of increased volume in one generic pharmaceutical product and the initial shipments of several generic pharmaceutical products which have been in development for the past several years 
in addition  the increase is attributable to increased sales volume from the introduction of new products  especially in the fourth quarter  which was somewhat offset by lost sales from customers who purchased chemicals provided by this segment s former primary supplier 
that supplier terminated a supply agreement in october the nutritionals business showed a slight decline in versus due to softer demand for nutritional supplements 
the chemicals colorants segment saw an overall decrease of  or  to  in from  in this decrease reflects a general slowdown in the economy and in the entire industrial chemicals market

institutional sanitary supplies other sales were  for versus  last year  a decrease of or 
the decline was attributable to an overall decline in demand due to the general economic slowdown in the united states during this past year

the gross margins realized from the schweizerhall pharma business in this segment are generally lower than the margins earned by our traditional business due to a different pricing and product mix 
the agrochemicals segment showed a decline in gross profit of  which was in contrast to the increase in sales 
the restructuring of the company s arrangement referred to earlier led to an increase in sales  but the same gross profit contribution 
this is the primary cause of this discrepancy between sales and gross profit percentages for the period 
the chemicals colorants segment s gross profit declined  which was significantly higher than the decline in sales 
continued erosion of margins due to competitive pressures in many areas  particularly printing inks and electronic chemicals  caused this higher percentage decrease in margins than sales 
institutional sanitary supplies and other gross margins were in versus in the increased gross margins are a direct result of changes from a pricing review  lower costs and product mix

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market price  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market price risk short term investments at june  of which consists solely of corporate securities and are recorded at fair value have exposure to price risk 
this risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices quoted by stock exchanges and amounts to as of june  actual results may differ 
foreign currency exchange risk in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company hedges some of its transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of its various entities 
the instruments used for hedging are short term foreign currency contracts futures 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the currency of the related hedged transactions 
at june   the company had foreign currency contracts outstanding that have a notional amount of  the difference between the fair market value of the foreign currency contracts and the related commitments at inception and the fair market value of the contracts and the related commitments at june  was in addition  the company also enters into cross currency interest rate swaps to reduce foreign currency exposure on intercompany transactions 
in may  the company entered into a five year cross currency interest rate swap transaction for the purpose of hedging fixed interst rate  foreign currency denominated cash flows under an inter company loan receivable 
under the terms of this derivative financial instrument  us dollar fixed principal and interest payments to be received under an intercompany loan will be swapped for euro denominated fixed principal and interest payments 
the fair market value of the swap at june  was 
the gains or losses on the foreign currency loan receivable will be offset by the gains or losses on the swap 
because the company is receiving fixed interest payments under the swap  it is still subject to fluctuations in value due to changes in euro and us dollar foreign currency rates and us dollar interest rates 
as of june  the impact of these fluctuations was not significant 
this hedge was deemed to be highly effective as of june  the company is subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for its subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
on june   the company had translation exposure to various foreign currencies with the most significant being the euro and singapore dollars 
the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates  as of june   amounts to  actual results may differ 
interest rate risk the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based upon its financing  investing and cash management activities 
the company utilizes a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company s financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this sensitivity analysis  the company used the same change in interest rate for all maturities 
all other factors were held constant 
if there were an adverse change in interest rates of  the expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be immaterial 
however  there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly affect its results of operations
