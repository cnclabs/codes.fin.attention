overview we design  manufacture  and market high performance  high density programmable logic devices  or plds  pre defined design building blocks known as intellectual property  or ip  cores  and associated development tools 
our plds  which consist of field programmable gate arrays  or fpgas  and complex programmable logic devices  or cplds  are semiconductor integrated circuits that are manufactured as standard chips that our customers program to perform desired logic functions within their electronic systems 
our customers can license ip cores from us for implementation of standard functions in their pld designs 
customers can also develop  compile  verify  and program their pld designs using our proprietary development software  which operates on personal computers and engineering workstations 
fpgas  which represented of our sales in  consist of our stratix  cyclone  apex  apex ii  flex  acex  excalibur  and mercury families  and cplds  which represented of our total sales in  consist of our max and classic families 
the balance of our sales consists of masked devices  software tools  ip cores  and support products 
our products serve a wide range of markets  including telecommunications  data communications  computing and storage  consumer  and industrial applications 
we classify our products into three categories new  mainstream  and mature and other products 
new products include acex k  apex kc  apex ke  apex ii  max b  cyclone  excalibur  hardcopy  mercury  and stratix families  mainstream products include apex k  flex  flex ka  flex ke  max a  and max a families  and mature and other products include classic  flex  flex k  max  max s  and max families  mpld  configuration and other devices  tools  and intellectual property 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
our management believes that we consistently apply judgments and 
table of contents estimates and such consistent application results in financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on our statement of operations and financial conditions 
critical accounting policies  as defined by the securities and exchange commission  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies include those regarding revenue recognition  the valuation of inventories  and the valuation of property  equipment  and intangible assets 
revenue recognition 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and to electronic components distributors who resell products to oems or their subcontract manufacturers 
we recognize revenue on products sold to oems upon shipment  but defer recognition of revenue on products sold to distributors until the products are resold 
more than ninety five percent of our products are sold to distributors for subsequent resale to oems or their subcontract manufacturers 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer on their shipments as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
using this reported information  we apply judgment in reconciling changes in distributors inventories of our products to their reported activities 
we have developed robust systems for receiving that information and have additionally developed cross checks for verifying the accuracy of the reported information 
in addition  we perform audits of our distributors information systems and inventories 
we believe that the information supplied to us by our distributors is materially accurate and complete 
if distributors incorrectly report their sales or mis state their inventory of our products  it could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues and income 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost on a first in first out basis approximated by standard cost or market 
we reserve inventory that is excess to projected customer demand  and the creation of such reserves results in a write down of inventory to net realizable value and a charge to cost of goods sold 
historically  it has been difficult to forecast customer demand especially at the part number level 
many of the orders we receive from our customers and distributors request delivery of product on relatively short notice and with lead times less than our manufacturing cycle time 
in order to provide competitive delivery times to our customers  we build and stock a certain amount of inventory in anticipation of customer demand that may not materialize 
moreover  as is common in the semiconductor industry  we allow customers to cancel orders with minimal advance notice 
thus  even product built to satisfy specific customer orders may not ultimately be required to fulfill customer demand 
we routinely compare our inventory against projected demand and as a result frequently record immaterial inventory charges to provision for excess and obsolete inventories 
nevertheless  at any point in time  some portion of our unreserved inventory is subject to the risk of being materially in excess to projected demand 
in  as a result of a large and unforecasted decline in sales  we determined that a significant portion of our inventory was excess to projected demand and recorded inventory charges of million 
while we endeavor to accurately predict demand and stock commensurate inventory levels  we may record unanticipated material inventory write downs in the future 
valuation of property  equipment and intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our property  equipment and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we regularly compare the carrying value of long lived assets to our projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets and in the event that the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment charge against income equal to the excess of the carrying value over the asset s fair value 
actual useful lives and future cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
these differences could have a material effect on our future operating results 
in  we recorded a charge of million for the impairment of production and other equipment that was removed from service and subsequently sold  purchased intangible assets related to technology acquired in previous acquisitions but no longer being used  and investments in development stage enterprises that were in financial distress 
these charges were classified as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
results of operations sales sales were million in  million in  and  million in sales declined in from and in from 
table of contents the decline in sales in was the result of five consecutive sequential declines in quarterly sales beginning in the fourth quarter of and ending in the fourth quarter of the protracted deceleration resulted in a peak to trough decline in quarterly sales of nearly 
this period of decline was the result of a general economic downturn and softening demand for products manufactured by our customers  especially those in the communications and computing equipment markets 
our customers  in response to reduced demand for their products  acted to reduce their inventories resulting in an inventory contraction throughout the entire supply chain 
the reduction in end market demand coupled with the inventory contraction resulted in significant sales declines for the semiconductor industry including the programmable logic segment 
as the rate of decline in our customers markets moderated and as customers achieved reduced inventories consistent with their reduced sales levels  they began to procure more semiconductors  including our products 
this increase in demand  coupled with increasing sales of our new products  led to sequential quarterly sales increases during sales in total decreased in compared to primarily due to lower unit sales of our mature and mainstream products as well as lower average unit selling prices in all product categories 
sales by product category  as a percentage of total sales  were as follows for   and years ended december  new mainstream mature and other total sales new products represented of total sales in  up from of total sales in our new products have been developed and introduced to the marketplace over the last several years 
these products have additional features and higher densities than their predecessors 
as a result of increased customer demand for plds  with higher densities and enhanced performance  we have experienced a shift in sales to our newer products from our more mature products 
sales of new products increased in compared to  and in compared to we expect that sales of our new products will continue to increase in as design win momentum in our new products continues to be strong 
sales of mainstream products declined in compared to and in compared to sales of mature and other products declined in compared to and in compared to the declines in both product categories for and were driven by continued softness in end markets  discontinuation of certain product lines by some customers  excess inventory at various customers  as well as price declines 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and our products are subject to price erosion 
new products generally have higher selling prices that typically decline over a product s life cycle 
our strategy is to offset the overall reduction in sales that results from declining selling prices by introducing new products 
this strategy is dependent on successful development and roll out of new products and the market s acceptance of those products 
we believe that we have been generally successful in that regard  but can give no assurance of future success 
unless future new products are developed and introduced in a timely fashion and achieve market acceptance  future sales will decline 
effective january   we adopted a new methodology for revenue classification by market segment 
the market segment data is derived by analysis that involves interpretation and extrapolation and relies on information provided to us by our distributors and end customers  actual percentages may be different 
sales by market segment  as a percentage of total sales  were as follows for comparable data for prior years is not available 
year ended december  communications industrial and automotive computer and storage consumer total sales 
table of contents sales in the communications market segment declined in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period a year ago 
for the same periods  industrial and automotive increased  computer and storage increased  and consumer increased 
the increase in the industrial and automotive market segment was primarily due to growth in medical business and manufacturing and test and measurement equipment 
the increase in the consumer market segment was primarily due to growth in the digital broadcast business 
despite the unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending for communications equipment  we continued to generate the largest percentage of our sales from the communications market segment 
the communications market segment includes the networking  telecommunications  and wireless sectors 
we believe that the communications market segment will continue to be our largest market segment for the foreseeable future 
sales by geography  as a percentage of total sales  were as follows for   and years ended december  north america europe japan asia pacific total international total sales north america sales represented of total sales in compared to in and in in large part  the percentage of sales for north america declined as certain end customers shifted their production from north america to subcontract manufacturing sites located in asia pacific 
we expect that sales will continue to transfer from north america  europe  and japan to asia pacific for the foreseeable future 
in absolute dollars  north america sales declined in from  while sales in europe declined  and japan declined 
the declines in sales were primarily due to a general economic downturn and softening end market demand especially in the communications and computer and storage sectors 
in  north america sales declined from  while sales in europe declined  japan declined  and asia pacific declined 
the decreases in sales in all geographical locations were primarily a result of unfavorable economic conditions that began to affect us in november major items in the statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of sales  were as follows years ended december  cost of sales gross margin total research and development expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses restructuring and other special charges income loss from operations gain on sale of wafertech  llc interest and other income  net provision for income taxes net income loss gross margin gross margins were in  in  and in gross margin in included a benefit of million resulting from the sale of inventory previously written down in excluding this inventory related benefit  gross margin was in 
table of contents gross margin in included a million write down of inventories  which was charged against cost of sales 
excluding this inventory write down  gross margin was in the write down reflected our evaluation that much of our inventory was in excess of projected demand 
through the first three quarters of  we experienced rapid growth in demand for our products 
because we believed that strong demand would continue and because we desired to reduce lead times and improve customer service levels  we ordered significant volumes of wafers for delivery in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of demand began to fall precipitously in the fourth quarter of  rendering many of the wafers that we had ordered in excess of projected demand 
the products that we procure from our wafer suppliers are custom and unique to us 
once our suppliers begin production  we are obliged to take delivery of  and pay for  the material we have ordered 
our wafer suppliers manufacturing cycle times are often as long as three months and sometimes longer 
this long manufacturing cycle time as contrasted to our customers desire for short delivery lead times necessitates that we order material based upon internal forecasts of demand 
in the future  to the extent that we misestimate total demand  or the mix of demand  we may degrade customer service to unacceptably low levels or may procure materials that prove to be excess to projected demand  which may result in additional charges against cost of sales 
excluding the inventory benefit and the inventory write down  gross margins were in and in on this basis  the decrease in gross margins in compared to last year was due to declines in selling prices  coupled with fixed unit costs 
excluding the favorable impact relating to the sale of inventory previously written down  we expect that gross margin will be in the range of to for this expectation is based on anticipated improvement in manufacturing overhead absorption as we increase production for certain products and on anticipated lower die costs resulting from improved yields and lower wafer prices  offset by declines in selling prices 
additionally  we anticipate that gross margins will benefit by approximately million in from the sale of inventory previously written down 
the actual amount of the benefit is dependent on the mix of products ordered by customers  is subject to significant volatility  and is difficult to reliably predict 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in and million  or of sales  in research and development expenses include expenditures for labor  masks  prototype wafers  the amortization of deferred stock based compensation for employees engaged in research and development activities  and expenses for the development of process technologies  new packages  and software to support new products and design environments 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase was primarily attributable to higher spending on prototype wafers 
historically  the level of research and development expenses has fluctuated in part due to the timing of the purchase of masks and prototype wafers used in the development of new products 
we expect that research and development expenses in will remain high relative to sales  and will be in the range of million to million as we continue the rapid rollout of stratix  stratix gx  and cyclone families driving high mask  wafer  and prototype expenses 
in  despite unfavorable economic conditions  we continued to invest in the development of new products in order to maintain our competitive position 
excluding the million one time acquired in process research and development charge taken in  research and development expenses remained relatively flat in compared to during  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million for the acquisitions of designpro inc and right track cad inc  which is being amortized to research and development expenses over a period of three to four years 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation included in research and development expenses was million in  million in  and million in we will continue to make significant investments in the development of new products and focus our efforts on the development of new plds and hardware that utilize advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes  as well as related development software 
we are currently investing in the development of our cyclone  stratix  stratix gx  and hardcopy families  our quartus ii software  and other future products 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales in and million  or of sales  in selling  general  and administrative expenses primarily include salary expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  commissions and incentives  depreciation  legal  advertising  facilities  and travel and entertainment expenses 

table of contents selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease was primarily due to spending control measures including the restructuring program implemented in  lower expenses for labor  advertising  recruiting  travel  and entertainment  as well as reduced litigation expenses stemming from the settlement of our litigation with xilinx and lattice semiconductor corporation 
we expect that selling  general  and administrative expenses will increase in to be in the range of million to million 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased slightly in compared to despite the slight increase  the rate of spending dropped steadily during the year primarily due to spending control measures 
spending in the fourth quarter of decreased from our peak spending in the first quarter of restructuring and other special charges during  we recorded restructuring and other special charges of million in connection with our plan to reduce future operating expenses and to align our organization s cost structure with a reduction in projected sales resulting from unfavorable economic conditions 
the charges consisted of severance and fringe benefits related to our workforce reduction of approximately employees primarily in selling  general  and administrative functions 
the charges also included the write down associated with the spin off of northwest logic  the write down of certain equipment and intangible assets  the consolidation of excess facilities  and the termination of certain license agreements 
in addition  we made a one time payment of million as part of our patent litigation settlement with xilinx 
these charges were classified as operating expenses in in our consolidated statement of operations 
the following table summarizes the charges in and the activity related to the restructuring liability during and restructuring restructuring cash liability as of cash liability as of total non cash payments in december  payments in december  in thousands charges charges workforce reduction litigation settlement spin off of northwest logic impairment of production and other equipment impairment of investments and intangible assets consolidation of excess facilities and other total cash expenditures relating to workforce reductions have been substantially paid 
amounts related to non cancelable leases will be paid over their respective terms through the third quarter of the restructuring liability  totaling million as of december   is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
in process research and development during  we recorded a non recurring charge of million to in process research and development related to the acquisition of designpro and right track 
we determined this non recurring charge using valuation techniques generally used by appraisers in the high technology industry 
we immediately expensed this non recurring charge in the period of acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative use had been identified 
as of december   we believe that the projections used in the valuations with respect to each acquisition are still materially valid  however  there can be no assurance that the projected results will be achieved 
income loss from operations income from operations was million  or of sales  in compared to a loss from operations of million  or of sales  in and income from operations of million  or of sales  in the increase in income from operations in was primarily due to the inventory  restructuring  and other special charges taken during excluding these charges  income from operations in was million  or of sales 
on that basis  the decrease in income from operations compared to last year was due to the decrease in sales and gross margin percentage  partially offset by the decrease in total operating expenses 

table of contents loss from operations in was primarily due to a decline in sales  as well as the inventory write down  restructuring  and other special charges 
interest and other income  net interest and other income was million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in and million  or of sales  in interest and other income consists mainly of interest income generated from investments in high quality fixed income securities 
the year over year declines in both and were primarily due to lower market interest rates 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rates were for  for  and for excluding the inventory  restructuring  and other special charges taken in and a one time gain on the sale of wafertech  llc in  our effective tax rates were for  for  and for the reduction of the effective tax rate  as measured on this basis  over the three year period primarily resulted from the increased impact of tax exempt income and research and development tax credits  as well as a change in the geographic mix of income 
we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately 
equity investment on december   we sold our ownership interest in wafertech to a subsidiary of tsmc for million in cash 
the one time pre tax gain on the sale was million 
through december   we accounted for our investment under the equity method based on our ability to exercise significant influence over wafertech s operating and financial policies 
our equity in the loss of wafertech was million for financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources year we ended with million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments available to finance our operating activities and future growth 
since our inception  we have used a combination of equity and debt financing and cash generated from operations to support our operating activities  capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments  and repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program 
in  we spent million to repurchase our common stock  compared to million in  and million in we also spent million to purchase capital equipment in  compared to million in  and million in we believe that capital expenditures will be higher in compared to we also lease facilities under non cancelable lease agreements expiring at various times through rental expense amounted to million in we anticipate that our lease payments in will approximate we believe the available sources of funds including cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  and cash we expect to generate from operations will be adequate to finance our activities for at least the next year 
future minimum lease payments are as follows years ending december  in thousands thereafter total cash and cash equivalents increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase resulted from million provided by operating activities  net of million used for investing activities and million used for financing activities 
our positive cash flow from operations was primarily attributable to net income  depreciation and amortization  amortization of deferred stock based compensation  decreases in other current assets resulting primarily from the receipt of a tax refund  inventories  and deferred income taxes  as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued compensation 
these items were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 

table of contents during  cash used for investing activities of million primarily consisted of purchases of short term investments and capital equipment 
these items were partially offset by proceeds from the maturity and sale of short term investments 
cash used for financing activities of million resulted from the repurchase of million shares of our common stock  which was partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of million shares of our common stock to employees through various option plans and our employee stock purchase plan 
year we ended with million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease resulted from million used for operating activities  million used for investing activities  and million used for financing activities 
our negative cash flow from operations was primarily attributed to our net loss  decreases in deferred income on sales to distributors  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and income taxes payable  and an increase in other current assets 
these items were partially offset by depreciation and amortization  amortization of deferred stock based compensation  and decreases in inventories  accounts receivable  and deferred income taxes 
during  cash used for investing activities of million consisted of purchases of capital equipment  short term investments  and long term investments 
cash used for financing activities of million resulted from the repurchase of million shares of our common stock  which was partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of million shares of our common stock to employees through various option plans and our employee stock purchase plan 
employees we had  employees at the end of   employees at the end of  and  employees at the end of impact of currency translation and inflation we purchase the majority of our materials and services in us dollars and sell our products to oems and distributors in us dollars 
as of december   we had no open forward contracts  however  we may enter into contracts from time to time to hedge foreign exchange exposure 
we have  in the past  entered into forward contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations associated with contractual commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
during  we entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase malaysian ringgits to meet a portion of our firm contractual commitments to be paid in ringgits 
the contract was settled in june common stock repurchases during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of million  compared to million shares for an aggregate cost of million in fiscal  and million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of million in fiscal in october  our board of directors approved an increase in the shares authorized for repurchase from million shares to million shares 
since the inception of our repurchase program in  through december   we have repurchased a total of million of the million shares authorized for repurchase 
all shares were retired upon acquisition 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force no 
 or eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  if we engage in any exit or disposal activities in the future  the adoption of sfas no 
might have a material effect on future financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin no 
requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin no 
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements of fin no 
are effective 
table of contents for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  our adoption of fin no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors the following risk factors  among others  have affected and  in the future  could affect our actual results of operations and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by us 
before you decide to buy  hold  or sell our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained elsewhere in this report 
the following risk factors are not the only risk factors facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition  and results of operation could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our financial results depend on our ability to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the programmable logic industry is intensely competitive 
our ability to compete successfully in the industry will depend on our ability to develop  manufacture  and sell complex semiconductor components and development tools that offer customers greater value than solutions offered by competing vendors such as xilinx and lattice 
because we develop plds for applications that are presently served by vendors of asics and processor related products  such as microcontrollers and dsps  we also indirectly compete in the markets for asics  microcontrollers  and dsps 
many of these vendors  including analog devices  inc  international business machines corporation  lsi logic corporation  and texas instruments inc have substantially greater financial  technical  and marketing resources than we do and have well established market positions and solutions that have been proven technically feasible and economically competitive over several decades 
we may not be able to displace these vendors in the targeted applications and densities 
further  other programmable logic vendors are targeting these applications and may be successful in securing market share from us 
moreover  our customers have historically used standard cell technologies to achieve greater integration in their systems  this may not only impede our efforts to penetrate the markets for asics  microcontrollers  and dsps  but may also displace our products in the applications that we presently serve 
our future success depends on our ability to define  develop  and sell new products that achieve market acceptance 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic market characterized by rapid technological change 
our current product development efforts focus on developing new plds  related development software and hardware  and advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes 
our development efforts may not result in the timely introduction of competitive new products  enhancements to existing products in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive product offerings  and or market acceptance of new and existing products 
we depend entirely on independent subcontractors to supply us with finished silicon wafers 
we depend entirely upon subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers 
we purchase nearly all of our silicon wafers from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  and the remaining portion from sharp corporation 
silicon wafer production facilities have at any given time a fixed capacity  the allocation of which is determined solely by our vendors and over which we have no direct control 
we have no formalized long term commitment from our foundry suppliers 
if market demand for silicon wafers suddenly exceeds market supply  our supply of silicon wafers can become limited quickly 
a shortage in foundry manufacturing capacity could hinder our ability to meet demand for our products 
moreover  silicon wafers constitute more than half of our product cost 
if we are unable to procure wafers at favorable prices  our gross margins will be adversely affected 
to ensure the continued supply of wafers  we may establish other sources of wafer supply for our products as such arrangements become economically advantageous or technically necessary 
however  there are only a few foundries that have the capabilities to manufacture our products 
if we engage alternative sources of supply with foundries that have the capabilities to manufacture our products  we may encounter start up difficulties 
also  shipments could be delayed significantly while such sources are qualified for volume production 
in addition to sufficient foundry manufacturing capacity  we depend on good production yields and timely delivery of silicon wafers to meet our customers demand for products and to maintain profit margins 
the manufacture of cmos wafers is a 
table of contents highly complex process 
wafer production yields depend on a wide variety of factors  including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
as is common in the semiconductor industry  we have experienced  and may experience from time to time  problems with achieving acceptable production yields and timely delivery from our foundry vendors 
difficulties in production yields can often occur when we begin production of new products  when we transition to new processes  or when our principal wafer supplier  tsmc  moves production of a product from one manufacturing plant to another  or manufactures the same product at multiple factories 
further  production throughput times vary considerably among our wafer suppliers and among the various factories used by our wafer suppliers  and we may experience delays from time to time in processing some of our products 
these difficulties and delays can potentially result in significantly higher costs and lower product availability 
we have in the past experienced supply shortages 
for example  from the fourth quarter of through the first half of  process control issues associated with volume ramp up at a wafer supplier resulted in low die yields on our flex ka and flex ke products  thereby leading to reduced product availability in these families 
as a result  we were unable to support distributor stocking at desired levels and in some cases could not meet end customer demand 
we expect that  to maintain or enhance our competitive position  we will continue to introduce new products using  and convert established products to  new and more advanced process technologies 
for example  our stratix family is manufactured on a micron  all layer copper interconnect process for which there is limited production history 
we will also continue to transition our fabrication process arrangements to larger wafer sizes and smaller circuit geometries 
such transitions entail inherent technological risks and start up difficulties that can adversely affect yields  costs  and timeliness of delivery 
to enhance our product designs and cost structure  we depend on all of our subcontractors  and especially our principal foundry partner  tsmc  to improve process technologies in a timely manner 
we depend on independent subcontractors  located primarily in asia  to assemble and test our semiconductor products 
independent subcontractors  located primarily in asia  assemble and test our semiconductor products 
because we rely on independent subcontractors to perform these services  we cannot directly control our product delivery schedules or quality levels 
for example  in the second quarter of  difficulties with a subcontractor s manufacturing process limited the availability of packaging materials piece parts used in certain of our proprietary fineline bga  or ball grid array  packages  thereby causing limited production 
this in turn limited shipments of our flex ke product family 
our future success also depends on the financial viability of our independent subcontractors 
the recent reduction in overall demand for semiconductor products has financially stressed certain of our subcontractors and has weakened their capital structures 
if the capital structures of our independent subcontractors further weaken  we may experience future product shortages  quality assurance problems  increased manufacturing costs  and or supply chain disruption 
conditions outside the control of our independent subcontractors may impact their business operations 
the economic  market  social  and political situations in countries where certain independent subcontractors are located are unpredictable  can be volatile  and can have a significant impact on our business because we may not be able to obtain product in a timely manner 
market conditions  including currency fluctuation  political strife  labor disruption  power shortages  and other factors  including natural or man made disasters  adverse changes in tax laws  tariff  or freight rates  or interruption in air transportation  in areas where our independent subcontractors are located also could have a severe negative impact on our operating capabilities 
for example  in september  a major earthquake struck taiwan  resulting in widespread physical damage and loss of life 
the earthquake halted wafer fabrication production at our primary vendor  tsmc  for several days and then only limited production began 
nearly two weeks passed before full production resumed  and a portion of the inventory in the production process was scrapped as a result of damage incurred during the earthquake 
our independent subcontractors may experience similar or more severe problems in the future as a result of similar events 
our intellectual property rights may not provide meaningful protection from our competitors 
we rely significantly on patents to protect our intellectual property rights 
as of december   we held a total of issued united states patents and patents issued in other countries relating to various aspects of our products and technology and had a number of patent applications pending 
our patents and patent applications may not provide meaningful protection from our competitors 
our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents or develop new 
table of contents patentable technologies that displace our existing products 
further  we may not be able to timely develop or patent new technologies  and those patents granted to us may not be valuable in all markets or may not enable us to develop new products that achieve market acceptance 
also  from time to time in the normal course of business  we receive and make inquiries with respect to possible patent infringements 
as a result of inquiries received from third parties  it may be necessary or desirable for us to obtain licenses relating to one or more of our current or future products 
we may not be able to obtain such licenses on reasonable terms 
in addition to patent protection  we rely on trademark  trade secret  copyright  and mask work laws to protect our unpatented proprietary information or technologies 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure  parties  including our former employees or consultants  may attempt to disclose  obtain  or use our proprietary information or technologies without our authorization 
other companies may also develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or technologies or infringe on our trademarks and service marks  potentially causing our brand recognition to decline 
the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information and technologies  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if other companies obtain our proprietary information or technologies or develop substantially equivalent information or technologies  they may develop products that compete against ours products 
we may face significant costs arising from intellectual property litigation 
intellectual property claims brought against us  regardless of their merit  can result in costly litigation and the diversion of our financial resources and technical and management personnel 
legal proceedings also tend to be unpredictable and may be affected by events outside of our control 
further  we may not succeed in defending or enforcing our intellectual property rights 
if we are not successful in defending or enforcing our intellectual property rights  third parties may obtain significant monetary damages or an injunction against the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product families 
we have been a party to lawsuits and may in the future become a party to lawsuits involving various types of claims  including  but not limited to  unfair competition and intellectual property matters 
in july  we entered into a settlement agreement with xilinx under which we settled all pending litigation with xilinx 
as part of the settlement agreement  we entered into a royalty free patent cross license agreement with xilinx  including a prohibition against further patent litigation between the two companies through july in connection with the settlement agreement  we paid xilinx a one time payment of million 
prior to the settlement with xilinx  we devoted substantial financial resources over an eight year period to the xilinx litigation 
similarly  in july  we entered into a settlement agreement with lattice under which we settled all pending patent litigation with lattice 
as part of the settlement agreement with lattice  we entered into a royalty free patent cross license agreement with lattice  including a multi year prohibition against further patent litigation between the two companies 
no payments were made by altera or lattice as part of the settlement 
we may incur warranty related liabilities 
we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for varying lengths of time 
if there is a material increase in the rate of customer claims or our estimates of probable losses relating to specifically identified warranty exposures are inaccurate  we may record a charge against future cost of sales 
warranty expense has historically been immaterial 
we depend on distributors to generate sales and fulfill our customer orders 
worldwide sales through distributors accounted for more than ninety five percent of our total sales during we rely on several distributors to assist us in creating customer demand  providing technical support and other value added services to our customers  filling customer orders  and stocking our products 
our contracts with our distributors may be terminated by either party in a relatively short period of time 
our distributors are located all over the world and are of various sizes and financial strength 
the recent economic downturn has placed financial strain on our distributors 
lower sales  lower earnings  debt downgrades  the inability to access capital markets  and higher interest rates could potentially impact our distributors financial operations 
we are highly dependent on arrow electronics  inc in many locations across the world  particularly in north america 
during  arrow on a worldwide basis accounted for approximately of sales  and the next largest distributor 
table of contents accounted for approximately of sales 
as of december   arrow accounted for approximately of total accounts receivable  while the next largest distributor accounted for of total accounts receivable 
from time to time  our distributors may accept returns from end customers as they deem necessary in the ordinary course of business 
returns from end customers to our distributors are negative sales transactions and reduce our reported sales 
large returns could have a material impact on our forecasted and or actual sales 
the length of our design in and sales cycle could impact our future sales 
our sales depend on our products being designed into our end customers products and those products achieving volume production 
our products are very complex in nature  and the time from design in to volume production ranges from months to years 
from initial product design in to volume production  many factors could impact the timing of our sales or our ability to generate sales 
these factors  include  but are not limited to  the competitive position of our technology  customer adoption of our products and tools  the competitiveness of our customers products in the markets they serve  our customers financial stability  and our ability to ship products according to our customers schedule 
we depend on international sales for a majority of our total sales 
during each of the last two years  international sales were a majority of our total sales 
during  international sales constituted approximately of our total sales 
risks related to our foreign operations include unfavorable economic  market  political  and social conditions in a specific country or region  fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates  foreign currency weakness against the united states dollar  adverse changes in tax laws  increased freight costs  interruptions in air transportation  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  generally longer receivable collection periods  and natural or man made disasters in a specific country or region where we sell our products 
our business is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the importation or exportation of semiconductor products 
quotas  duties  tariffs  taxes  or other charges  restrictions  or trade barriers may be imposed by the united states or other countries upon the importation or exportation of our products in the future 
our business is subject to tax risks associated with being a multinational corporation 
as a multinational corporation  we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions 
the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions 
the application of tax law is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of regulation  and court rulings 
consequently  taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and or our effective income tax rate 
our gross margins are subject to fluctuations due to many factors 
our gross margins may fluctuate depending on many factors  including  but not limited to  our product mix  market acceptance of our new products  competitive pricing dynamics  geographic and or business segment pricing strategies  and various manufacturing cost variables 
our financial results are affected by general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  which means that semiconductor companies such as altera experience significant fluctuations in sales and profitability 
the semiconductor industry has been significantly impacted by the recent economic downturn and contraction in the computing and communication equipment markets and by the ensuing inventory correction in the supply chain for those industries 
this downcycle  like many of the preceding downcycles  has resulted in significant reductions in unit demand  excess customer inventories  price erosion  and excess production capacity 
we experienced five consecutive declines in quarterly sales beginning in the fourth quarter of and ending in the fourth quarter of the protracted deceleration resulted in a peak to trough decline in quarterly sales of nearly 
we anticipate that the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry will persist and that our sales will fluctuate accordingly 
in addition to reductions in sales  our profitability decreases during downturns as we are unable to reduce our expenses at the same rate as our sales decline 
for example  at the height of the previous upcycle  in the third quarter of  our operating 
table of contents expenses were less than of sales compared to almost of sales in the most recent quarter 
similarly  our gross margins tend to deteriorate during downcycles 
for example  in the third quarter of  our reported gross margin was over of sales compared to excluding the benefit from the sale of inventory previously written down of sales in the most recent quarter 
furthermore  the recent industry contraction was prolonged and severe and resulted in inventory charges of million in relating primarily to the write off of inventories in excess to projected demand 
additionally  as a result of reduced demand and in an effort to reduce our ongoing expense levels  we incurred restructuring charges and write downs totaling million in in the year ended december   our net income was million on sales of billion whereas for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million on sales of million 
we expect that our future sales and profitability will continue to be volatile 
last year in an effort to reduce the possibility of future charges for excess inventory  we reduced our inventory carrying targets 
our customers typically order product with less delivery lead time than our manufacturing cycle time 
the recently implemented reduction in targeted inventory carrying levels may result in poorer delivery performance relative to our customers desired lead times  which over time may erode our competitive position and result in a loss of market share 
moreover  we may not achieve our targeted inventory reductions and we may experience inventory write downs in the future 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the cyclical nature of demand for our customers products  general economic  market  political  and social conditions in the countries where we sell our products  demand for our products and the products of our customers  the pricing of our products and the products of our competitors  the gain or loss of a key customer  the timing of our and our competitors new product introductions  our inventory levels and product obsolescence  the scheduling  rescheduling  and cancellation of large orders by our customers  the availability of adequate supply commitments from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors  our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production at the foundries of tsmc or sharp  changes in manufacturing yields  changes in distribution partners or their financial stability  adverse movements in exchange rates  interest rates  or tax rates  or litigation expenses  including those litigation expenses incurred in connection with the defense or enforcement of our intellectual property rights 
our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical and management personnel 
our future success depends  in large part  upon the continued service of our key management  technical  sales  and support employees  and on our ability to continue to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
the competition for such employees is intense and the loss of key employees could prevent our sales and or profits from increasing or could cause our sales and or profits to decline 
our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes and other catastrophic events 
our corporate headquarters is located near major earthquake fault lines 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake  may cause significant disruption to our business 
in addition  our computer systems are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering 
further  our business is subject to the effects of war and acts of terrorism 
any catastrophic event  such as an earthquake or other natural disasters  the failure of our computer 
table of contents systems  or war or acts of terrorism  could significantly impair our ability to maintain our records  pay our suppliers  or manufacture or ship our products 
we carry only limited insurance coverages 
our insurance policies may not be adequate to fully offset the losses resulting from covered incidents 
additionally  we may not have coverage for certain losses 
for example  our property insurance does not provide coverage for losses caused by earthquake or war and only provides limited coverage for acts of terrorism 
our stock price may be subject to significant volatility 
in recent years  the stock market has experienced extreme price volatility and the price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations 
the overall stock market  the prices of semiconductor stocks in general  and the price of our stock may continue to fluctuate greatly 
we believe that factors such as quarter to quarter variances in financial results  announcements of new products  new orders  and order rate variations by us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the stock prices for many technology companies experience large fluctuations  which are often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic conditions such as a recessionary period or high interest rates  may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of million as of december  and million as of december  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will vary in value as market interest rates fluctuate 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december  and december   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
additionally  we anticipate holding our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we do not expect to realize an adverse impact on income or cash flows 
we have international subsidiaries and branch operations and are  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility has been insignificant 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates at december  and december   our financial position and results of operations would not be materially affected 
however  we cannot assure you that there will not be a material impact in the future
