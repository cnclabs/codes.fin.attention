related party transactions we have entered into two licenses with affiliates of our strategic partner  lv capital  usa inc lv capital  a wholly owned subsidiary of lvmh moet hennessy louis vuitton sa in may we entered into an exclusive worldwide license for prestige fragrances for the celine brand  and in march we entered into an exclusive worldwide license for christian lacroix fragrances 
both licenses are subject to certain minimum sales requirements  advertising expenditures and royalty payments as are customary in our industry 
results of operations net sales for the year ended december  increased to a record million 
for the year ended december   net sales were up 
at comparable foreign currency exchange rates  net sales rose in both and the increases in net sales are attributable to increases in both our prestige and mass market product lines 
prestige product sales  which were up approximately in  grew another in the growth in was the result of the continued global roll out of our burberry touch fragrance line 
during  we also continued the geographic expansion of our paul smith fragrance line 
in addition  in october  our celine fragrance line debuted in the united states and france 
our celine fragrance launch began slowly in the weeks following september th and prestige fragrance sales in general were slow for the first six months of however  we began to see a significant turnaround in july  which continued for the remainder of the year 
prestige product sales growth in was spurred by increased global distribution of our celine brand  which has a strong following throughout western europe and japan 
we also launched a new christian lacroix fragrance line  bazar  for men and women as well as two fragrance line extensions  essence pure by st dupont and paul smith extreme 
we have a strong line up of new brands and brand extensions in our new product pipeline 
in the spring of we plan to debut summer seasonal fragrances for both our celine and christian lacroix fragrance lines 
during the fourth quarter of  we plan to unveil a completely new burberry fragrance line and in october we plan to launch a fragrance and cosmetic line under the diane von furstenberg label 
with respect to our mass market product lines  sales gains were achieved in all three of our principal product groups mass market fragrances  intimate health and beauty aids and aziza cosmetics  for an overall improvement of in sales growth in mass market fragrances stems from our acquisition of certain fragrance brands from tristar corporation tristar  a debtor in possession in a chapter proceeding 
in may  we purchased trademarks and related intellectual property of certain brands for million  and acquired certain existing inventory for approximately million 
tristar was one of our most significant competitors in mass market fragrances and the brands acquired are being sold in the same distribution channels as that of our other mass market fragrance lines 
new product line extensions were the primary reasons for the increased sales volume from our intimate health and beauty aids and aziza cosmetic lines in we anticipate that there will be additional mass market sales growth in as we will be selling tristar brands for a full year 
for  our mass market product sales were up as a result of the initial launch of our intimate health and beauty aid line  as well as the continuing success of our aziza line of cosmetics 
our new product development program for all three of our principal mass market product groups is well under way  and we expect to roll out new mass market products throughout in addition  we are actively pursuing other new business opportunities 
however  we cannot assure you that any new license or acquisitions will be consummated 
gross profit margins were in  in and in in and  gross profit margins were ahead of our target rates of to primarily as a result of the strong dollar in relation to the euro 
this results from the fact that certain european sales are denominated in us dollars 
in  the weak us dollar reversed that trend 
in addition  our prestige fragrance lines  which in and grew at a faster rate than our mass market lines  generate a higher gross profit margin than our mass market product lines 
in  our mass market lines grew at a higher rate 
if the dollar remains weak throughout  then gross margins are expected to hover around our target rates of to 
selling  general and administrative expenses aggregated million in  million in and million in as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
our mass market sales do not require extensive advertising and therefore  more of our selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed rather than variable 
as a result  the increase in mass market sales enables us to spread our fixed costs over a larger net sales base 
on the other hand  promotion and advertising are prerequisites for sales of designer products 
we develop a complete marketing and promotional plan to support our growing portfolio of prestige fragrance brands and to build upon each brand s awareness 
promotion and advertising expense was approximately of prestige fragrance sales in and  and in in addition  recent increases in certain fixed costs  including insurance  rent and wages  is expected to cause a slight rise in selling  general and administrative expenses going into as previously reported  our french subsidiary  inter parfums  sa  is a party to litigation with jean charles brosseau  sa brosseau  the licensor of the ombre rose trademark 
in october  inter parfums  sa received notice of a judgment in favor of brosseau  which awarded damages of approximately  and which directed inter parfums  sa to turn over its license to brosseau within six months 
inter parfums  sa is appealing the judgment as it vigorously and categorically denies the claims of brosseau 
in june  as a result of certain developments  inter parfums  sa and its special litigation counsel considered it likely that the judgment would be sustained and therefore took a charge against earnings for  the full amount of the judgment 
in february  the court of appeal confirmed the brosseau claim with respect to turning over the license 
in addition  the court named an expert to proceed with additional investigations and required inter parfums  sa to pay  as an advance for damages claimed by brosseau 
inter parfums  sa is continuing its appeal as it still denies the claims of brosseau 
we do not believe that such litigation will have any further material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations 
during the year ended december  we sold marketable securities and realized a gain of million  after taxes and minority interest 
on occasion  we invest excess cash in marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale 
these funds are available to support current operations or to take advantage of other investment opportunities 
at december   we had no remaining marketable security positions and there were no marketable security transactions in and interest expense aggregated   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we use the credit lines available to us  as needed  to finance our working capital needs 
foreign currency gains or losses aggregated   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
occasionally  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments 
our effective income tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
tax rates in france declined slightly in and the effective tax rate for the year ended december  included a  accrual to cover the potential exposure related to tax audits of inter parfums  sa commenced by the french tax authorities 
excluding such charge our effective tax rate for was 
net income increased to million in after increasing to million in net income for the year ended december  included charges of  and a gain of  all after taxes and minority interest 
the charges represent an accrual for exposure relating to the brosseau litigation of  and a potential tax assessment of  the gain represents a realized gain on sale of marketable securities 
diluted earnings per share increased to in after increasing to in weighted average shares outstanding aggregated million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a diluted basis  average shares outstanding were million  for both years ended december  and and million in liquidity and financed resources profitable operating results continue to strengthen our financial position 
at december   working capital aggregated million and we had a working capital ratio of to cash and cash equivalents aggregated million and our net book value was per outstanding share as of december  furthermore  we had no long term debt 
on occasion we use a portion of our cash to make investments in marketable equity securities classified as available for sale 
these funds are available to support current operations or to take advantage of other investment opportunities 
these investments are made to maximize our return on cash 
as of december  we had no marketable security positions 
our short term financing requirements are expected to be met by available cash at december   cash generated by operations and short term credit lines provided by domestic and foreign banks 
the principal credit facilities for are a million unsecured revolving line of credit provided by a domestic commercial bank and approximately million in credit lines provided by a consortium of international financial institutions 
cash provided by operating activities aggregated million for the year ended december  as compared to million in at december   excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates  accounts receivable and inventories were up and  respectively  from december  the increase in accounts receivable is not unusual considering that net sales for the three months and year ended december   in constant dollars  were up and  respectively 
the increase in inventories is primarily attributable to the tristar inventory purchased in connection with the intellectual property acquisition in may in addition  we anticipate an inventory buildup throughout to support our schedule of new product launches 
commencing in march  our board of directors authorized our first cash dividend of 
per share  approximately million per annum  payable 
per share quarterly 
the first cash dividend of 
per share was paid on april to shareholders of record on march in march  our board of directors increased the cash dividend to 
per share  approximately million per annum  payable 
per share on a quarterly basis 
the first cash dividend of 
per share is to be paid on april to shareholders of record on march this increased cash dividend represents a small part of our cash position and is not expected to have any significant impact on our financial position 
in december  the chief executive officer exercised an outstanding stock option to purchase  shares of common stock  and the president exercised two outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the exercise prices of  for the chief executive officer and  for the president  respectively  were paid by each of them tendering to us  and  shares of our common stock  previously owned by the chief executive officer and the president  respectively  valued at per share  the fair market value on the date of exercise 
all shares issued pursuant to these option exercises were issued from our treasury stock 
in addition  the chief executive officer tendered an additional  shares for payment of withholding taxes resulting from the option exercises 
as a result of this transaction  we expect to receive a tax benefit of approximately  which has been reflected as an increase to additional paid in capital in the accompanying financial statements 
we believe that funds generated from operations  supplemented by our present cash position and available credit facilities  will provide us with sufficient resources to meet all present and reasonably foreseeable future operating needs 
in january  certain member countries of the european union established permanent fixed rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency  the euro 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro was completed on january  the introduction of the euro and the phasing out of other currencies have not had any material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation rates in the us and foreign countries in which we operate did not have a significant impact on operating results for the year ended december contractual obligations the following table sets for a schedule of our contractual obligations over the periods indicated in the table  as well as our total contractual obligations in thousands 
contractual obligations payments due by period less than years years more than total year years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases      purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap minimum royalty obligations      total      discussion of critical accounting policies we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following is a brief discussion of the more critical accounting policies that we employ 
revenue recognition we sell our products to department stores  perfumeries  mass market retailers  supermarkets and domestic and international wholesalers and distributors 
sales of such products by domestic subsidiaries are denominated in us dollars and sales of such products by foreign subsidiaries are primarily denominated in either euros or us dollars 
accounts receivable reflect the granting of credit to these customers 
we generally grant credit based upon analysis of the customer s financial position and previously established buying patterns 
we do not generally bill customers for shipping and handling costs and  accordingly  classify such costs as selling and administrative expenses 
revenues are recognized when merchandise is shipped and the risk of loss passes to the customer 
net sales are comprised of gross revenues less returns and trade discounts and allowances 
we do not generally allow customers to return their unsold products 
however  on a case by case basis we occasionally allow customer returns 
we regularly review and revise  as deemed necessary  our estimate of reserves for future sales returns based primarily upon historic trends and relevant current data 
we record estimated reserves for sales returns as a reduction of sales  cost of sales and accounts receivable 
returned products are recorded as inventories and are valued based on estimated realizable value 
the physical condition and marketability of returned products are the major factors we consider in estimating realizable value 
actual returns  as well as estimated realizable values of returned products  may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from estimates if factors such as economic conditions  inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
promotional allowances we have various performance based arrangements with retailers to reimburse them for all or a portion of their promotional activities related to our products 
these arrangements primarily allow customers to take deductions against amounts owed to us for product purchases 
estimated accruals for promotions and co operative advertising programs are recorded in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
we review and revise the estimated accruals for the projected costs for these promotions 
actual costs incurred may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from estimates if factors such as the level and success of the retailers programs or other conditions differ from our expectations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
we record adjustments to the cost of inventories based upon our sales forecast and the physical condition of the inventories 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
equipment and other long lived assets equipment  which includes tools and molds  is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital spending strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of equipment should be shortened  we would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over its revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the estimate of undiscounted cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in consumer acceptance of our products 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of other long lived assets should be shortened  we would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value after testing for impairment as described above  over the revised remaining useful life of such asset thereby increasing amortization expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that primarily consists of the use of derivative financial instruments 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not engage in the trading of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or interest rate swaps 
foreign exchange risk management we periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure related to receivables denominated in a foreign currency and to manage risks related to future sales expected to be denominated in a foreign currency 
we enter into these exchange contracts for periods consistent with our identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the receivables and cash flows of inter parfums  sa  our french subsidiary  whose functional currency is the euro 
all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions  which are rated as strong investment grade 
all derivative instruments are required to be reflected as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet measured at fair value 
generally  increases or decreases in fair value of derivative instruments will be recognized as gains or losses in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument will be recorded in other comprehensive income 
before entering into a derivative transaction for hedging purposes  we determine that the change in the value of the derivative will effectively offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item from a movement in foreign currency rates 
then  we measure the effectiveness of each hedge throughout the hedged period 
any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in the income statement 
we believe that our risk of loss as the result of nonperformance by any of such financial institutions is remote and in any event would not be material 
the contracts have varying maturities with none exceeding one year 
costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our financial results 
at december  we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts in the amount of approximately us million and gb pounds million
