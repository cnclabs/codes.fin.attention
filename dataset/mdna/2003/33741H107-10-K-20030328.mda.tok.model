total deposits increased million or  while gross loans and leases grew million to million or 
during the same time period  shareholders equity increased million to million  which was of assets 
the corporation s performance in  as compared to  reflects an increase in average earning assets as well as an increase in the net interest margin 
average earning assets were million in as compared to million in this is an increase of

non performing assets represented of total assets at december  this same ratio was for the year ending december  the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases was in as compared to for the prior year 
the allowance for probable loan and lease losses as a percentage of non performing loans was as of december  on february   the corporation and the bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with the huntington national bank to purchase four branch offices located in berkeley county  west virginia 
the acquisition will involve the assumption of approximately million in deposit liabilities and the purchase of million in outstanding loans as well as three buildings and fixed assets at these locations 
the fourth building is leased  which lease will be assumed by the bank 
net interest income net interest income is the largest source of operating revenue 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities 
as interest rates declined in  total interest income decreased in by  from million in to million in interest income was million in similarly  decreasing interest rates caused total interest expense to decrease  from million in to million in total interest expense was million in interest expense on savings deposits and interest bearing transaction accounts decreased million in to million from million in  reflecting the immediate effects of declining interest rates 
interest expense on time deposits decreased million in to million from million in through effective management of deposit and loan rates  net interest income increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
table analyzes the changes in net interest income attributable to volume and rate components 
for analytical purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis 
this adjustment facilitates performance comparisons between taxable and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate 
in  declining rates caused net interest income to increase

operating income non interest income declined in to a total of or from the total of million 
non interest income was million in non operating items affecting this comparison include security losses of 
million that were recognized in compared to a gain of 
million in secondly  a capital gain of 
million was recognized in due to the sale of a bank property 
no bank properties were sold in income from trust and fiduciary activities in was million 
this is a decrease of 
million from the million earned in and the million in trust and fiduciary activity income is directly affected by the performance of the equity and bond markets because the majority of trust account fees are calculated based on the market value of the assets under management 
the bank s trust department managed accounts whose average market values were million at december  as compared to million at december service charges on deposit accounts increased 
million due primarily to increases in return check charges 
insurance premium income increased 
million or in over levels 
other income increased

operating expense in totaled million 
the major categories of operating expense include salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  data processing expense  and other non interest expenses associated with the daily operations of the company 
salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expenses  increased million or in within this category  employee salaries increased 
million in over  due primarily to salary increases and new employees 
employee incentives increased 
million in over  due to an expanded incentive program 
pension costs and the costs of a supplemental executive retirement plan serp increased 
million and 
million  respectively  in over occupancy expense increased 
million in equipment expense increased 
million in over  due largely to software and equipment maintenance agreement costs  and the depreciation costs of software and equipment purchased in data processing expense increased 
million in over other expense increased 
million in over  resulting from increased legal and professional fees  increased consulting fees  vendor commission expense  and other miscellaneous cost increases 
operating expense management management believes that the efficiency ratio is an important measure of operating expense performance and cost management 
the ratio is calculated by analyzing non interest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus total non interest income 
during  the corporation s efficiency ratio was 
the ratio in was 
the ratio in was 
lower ratios indicate improved productivity 
applicable income taxes applicable income taxes are detailed in note of the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense amounted to million in compared with million in and million in these amounts represented effective tax rates of   and  for   and  respectively 
in  the corporation established first united investment trust  a maryland real estate investment trust  and its parent company first united capital investments  a delaware corporation 
the establishment of these entities eliminated most of the income taxes due to the state of maryland and income taxes due to the state of west virginia  thereby reducing the corporation s effective tax rate 
balance sheet overview the corporation s total assets reached million at december  this is an increase of million or over the december  total of million 
earning assets increased or million to a total of million at december  earning assets totaled million at december  investment securities the corporation s entire security portfolio is categorized as available for sale 
investment securities classified as available for sale are held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions as part of the asset liability management strategy 
available for sale securities are carried at market value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income included in shareholders equity  net of income taxes 
the corporation does not currently follow a strategy of making security purchases with a view of near term resales and therefore  does not own trading securities 
for additional information  see notes and to the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
total investment securities increased million or in from million in to a total of million 
the asset mix within the security portfolio shifted slightly with increases in the purchase of mortgage backed securities 
the mortgage backed securities were purchased as part of the leverage growth strategy program and policy that was adopted and implemented by the corporation during the third quarter of this program and policy was adopted with the goal of achieving increased returns on equity and earnings per share for the corporation s shareholders 
in july of  the corporation borrowed million in structured borrowings from the federal home loan bank of atlanta and reinvested these funds in mortgage backed securities 
in september of  a second leverage strategy was executed in the amount of million 
it is anticipated that the corporation will earn a favorable spread between the rate earned on the securities and the cost of the borrowings 
because interest rate risk is inherent in leveraging  the corporation mitigated its risk through the matching of the maturities of the investments with the borrowings 
management is committed to leverage growth strategies that will limit security purchases to those that it believes will minimize credit risk and will help to meet the objectives of the corporation s investment and asset liability management policies 
the corporation manages its investment portfolios utilizing policies which seek to achieve desired levels of liquidity  manage interest rate sensitivity  meet earnings objectives  and provide required collateral support for deposit activities 
excluding the us government sponsored agencies  the corporation had no concentration of investment securities from any single issues that exceeded of shareholders equity

loan and lease portfolio the corporation  through the bank and the oakfirst loan centers  is actively engaged in originating loans to customers primarily in garrett  allegany  washington  and frederick counties in maryland  mineral  hardy  berkeley  hampshire counties in west virginia  and the surrounding regions of west virginia and pennsylvania 
the corporation has policies and procedures designed to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of the corporation s loan portfolio 
these policies include underwriting standards for new credits and the continuous monitoring and reporting of asset quality and the adequacy of the reserve for probable loan and lease losses 
these policies  coupled with ongoing training efforts  have provided an effective check and balance for the risk associated with the lending process 
lending authority is based on the level of risk  size of the loan  and the experience of the lending officer 
table presents the composition of the corporation s loan and lease portfolio 
it has been the historical policy of the corporation to make the majority of its loan commitments in the market area it serves 
the corporation had no foreign loans in its portfolio as of december  during  gross loans and leases increased million or over to million 
loans and leases decreased million in the company allocates significant resources to seeking and serving its loan customers 
the commercial portfolio was the primary driver of growth in the overall loan portfolio in commercial loan growth totaled million in loans included in this category are commercial real estate loans  commercial installment loans  and commercial lines of credit 
residential mortgages decreased million in over the company experienced record refinancings in as customers took advantage of historically low interest rates through alternative vendors 
the company chose to not grow its balance sheet with fixed rate mortgages at these low levels 
home equity loans increased million in over this growth is attributed to a variety of special promotions held during the year 
total consumer installment loans grew million in within this category  the consumer indirect auto installment portfolio grew million in this portfolio decreased million in direct auto installment loans grew million in over table details the maturities of the loan and lease portfolio 
it is the policy of the corporation to place a loan in non accrual status whenever there is substantial doubt about the ability of a borrower to pay principal or interest on the outstanding credit 
management considers such factors as payment history  the nature of the collateral securing the loan  and the overall economic situation of the borrower when making a non accrual decision 
management closely monitors non accrual loans 
a non accruing loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments have been brought current  it becomes well secured  or is in the process of collection and the prospects of future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
at december   the corporation had million of non accrual loans

the corporation utilizes the methodology outlined in fdic statement of policy on allowance for loan and lease losses 
the starting point for this methodology is to segregate the loan portfolio into two pools  non homogeneous ie  commercial and homogeneous ie  consumer loans 
each loan pool is analyzed with general allowances and specific allocations being made as appropriate 
for general allowances  the previous eight quarters of loss activity are used in the estimation of probable losses in the current portfolio 
these historical loss amounts are modified by the following qualitative factors levels of and trends in delinquency and non accruals  trends in volumes and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policies  experience  ability  and depth of management  national and local economic trends and conditions  and concentrations of credit in the determination of the general allowance 
the qualitative factors are updated each quarter by the gathering of information from internal  regulatory  and governmental sources 
specific allocations are made for those loans on the watchlist in which the collateral value is less than the outstanding loan balance with the allocation being the dollar difference between the two 
allocations are made for loan commitments using the methodology outlined above 
the watchlist represents loans  identified and closely monitored by management  which possess certain qualities or characteristics that may lead to collection and loss issues 
allocations are not made for loans that are cash secured or for the small business administration guaranteed portion of loans 
during  management continued to place emphasis on procedures for credit analysis  problem loan detection  and delinquency follow ups 
as a result of these efforts  the provision for probable loan and lease losses in decreased over to million or of the gross loan total of million 
the provision for probable loan and lease losses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross charge offs for the years ended december    and totaled   and million  respectively

capital resources the bank and the corporation are subject to risk based capital regulations  which were adopted by federal banking regulators 
these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures  such as unused loan commitments and stand by letters of credit 
the regulatory guidelines require that a portion of total capital be tier i capital  consisting of common shareholders equity  trust issued preferred securities  and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
the remaining capital  or tier ii capital  consists of elements such as subordinated debt  mandatory convertible debt  trust issued preferred securities  and grandfathered senior debt  plus the reserve for probable loan and lease losses  subject to certain limitations 
under the risk based capital regulations  banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum for well capitalized banks total risk based capital ratio total qualifying capital divided by risk weighted assets  including a tier i ratio of 
the risk based capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio  defined as tier i capital divided by average assets  after certain adjustments 
the minimum leverage ratio is for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well diversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity and good earnings 
other banking organizations not in this category are expected to have ratios of at least  depending on their particular condition and growth plans 
higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
in the current regulatory environment  banking organizations must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk based deposit insurance assessments 
the corporation s capital policy establishes guidelines meeting these regulatory requirements  and takes into account current or anticipated risks and future growth opportunities 
on december   the corporation s total risk based capital ratio was  well above the regulatory minimum of 
the corporation s total risk based capital ratios for year end and were and  respectively

this is accomplished by formulating and implementing policies that take into account the sources and uses of funds  maturity and repricing distributions of assets and liabilities  pricing strategies  and marketability of assets 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to assure that the withdrawal demands of depositors and the legitimate credit needs of the corporation s delineated market areas are accommodated 
total liquid assets  represented by cash  federal funds sold  interest bearing deposits in banks  investment securities available for sale and loans and leases maturing within one year  amounted to million  or of total assets at december  this compares with million or of total assets  and million or of total assets 
additional liquidity of million is available from unused lines of credit at various upstream correspondent banks and the fhlb of atlanta 
interest rate sensitivity the corporation s primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics between assets and liabilities 
management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the corporation uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to measure and manage these risks 
the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interest earning asset and interest bearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date 
the differences between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval 
a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income  as more assets than liabilities will reprice 
a negative gap position would benefit the corporation during a period of declining interest rates 
in order to manage interest sensitivity risk  management of the corporation formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these guidelines are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios 
key assumptions used in the computer simulations include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  changes in asset volumes and pricing  and management s capital plans 
this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods 
management does not use derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the static gap analysis prepared by management indicated that the corporation was asset sensitive over the next year 
in computing the effect on pre tax income of changes in interest rates  management has assumed that any changes would immediately affect earnings 
normally  when an organization is asset sensitive there is a positive impact to income when interest rates increase 
the simulation analysis shown below shows a positive impact when interest rates increase or basis points in and in based on the simulation analysis performed at year end  the corporation estimates the following changes in income before taxes  assuming the indicated rate changes december  basis point increase million basis point increase million basis point decrease million basis point decrease million december  basis point increase million basis point increase million basis point decrease 
million basis point decrease million this estimate is based on assumptions that may be affected by unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment and any number of unforeseeable factors 
rates on different assets and liabilities within a single maturity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the relationships between prime rates and rates paid on purchased funds are not constant over time 
management can respond to current or anticipated market conditions by lengthening or shortening the corporation s sensitivity through loan repricings or changing its funding mix 
the rate of growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the absolute level of interest rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitive gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the net interest margin
