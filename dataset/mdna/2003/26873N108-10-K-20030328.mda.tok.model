item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which often require the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods 
we consider the following policies to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment  and because differences  between actual future events and the expectations on which these judgments were based  can have significant effects on our financial results reported for future periods 
revenue recognition on long term contracts revenue recognition for fixed price  long term contracts in the space technology and satcom segments is a critical accounting policy involving significant management estimates 
these segments long term contracts use the ratio of cost incurred to total estimated cost as the measure of performance that determines how much revenue should be recognized 
the calculation of total estimated cost relies on engineering estimates of the cost to complete the contract  with allowances for identifiable risks and uncertainties 
these engineering estimates are frequently reviewed and updated 
however  unforeseen problems can occur to substantially reduce the rate of future revenue recognition in relation to costs incurred 
most of the space technology segment s contracts involve development of new or unproven applications of technology 
due to technological uncertainties  a contract may be broadly defined in its early stages  with a structure to accommodate future changes in the scope of work or contract value as technical development progresses 
in such cases  management must estimate the future expected levels of scope of work and likely contract value changes to determine the appropriate level of current revenue associated with current costs incurred 
actual future changes may vary from expected changes  resulting in a reduction or increase in revenues recognized in future periods 
accrual of government incentives for research our accrual of research incentives from the canadian government is a critical accounting policy involving management estimates for our space technology segment 
these incentives are in the form of a cash reimbursement for a portion of certain qualified research expenditures 
incentives are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales  because the underlying research efforts primarily apply to development of technological capabilities for specific business opportunities 
for the year ended december   total incentives earned were approximately million  compared with million for the year ended december  we have established procedures to identify qualified costs and to submit appropriate claims for reimbursement  all of these claims are subject to financial and scientific audits by the canadian government concerning whether certain expenses qualified for incentive programs 
although there have historically been no significant disallowances of previously accrued incentives that resulted from these audits  such disallowances in the future would have an unfavorable effect on our statement of earnings 
evaluation of long lived assets for impairment all long lived assets on the balance sheet are periodically reviewed for impairment 
the most significant long lived asset is a less than equity investment in a limited partnership  skybridge llp  with a carrying value on the balance sheet of million at december  the goal of this investment is to enable us to participate in the development and implementation of a satellite network that will provide high data rate wireless services 
the partnership is an active and financially viable entity  and management representatives attend partners meetings to receive updates on the entity s progress 
since we acquired our equity investment four years ago  new equity partners have invested in the partnership at a higher subscription price than we paid 
as a result  we believe that the asset is not impaired and that it is appropriately accounted for as of december  however  due to current difficult economic conditions in the commercial space market  the partnership has delayed construction of its satellite network  and is instead developing a new business strategy based on an architecture with geo geosynchronous earth orbit satellites rather than leo low earth orbit satellites 
if the current difficult market conditions persist for commercial space ventures  we may determine at some future date that the asset has become impaired  which would require a charge to non operating income 
establishment of reserves for deferred income tax assets it is management s expectation that in the future our canadian operations will earn more than enough research related tax benefits each year to offset any canadian federal tax liability for any given year 
as a result  we have reserved substantially all the net deferred tax assets associated with these research related tax benefits totaling approximately million at december   because they are unlikely to be realized 
however  this reserve may be reduced resulting in an income tax benefit to a future statement of earnings if the level of our qualified research in canada decreases  which would lower the tax benefits earned in future years  or our profitability in canada increases  which would increase the tax liability incurred in future years 
results of operations most revenues were derived from commercial and international markets in  in and in  as compared with sales for us government end use 
more revenues were derived from sales to systems integrators  third party manufacturers and distributors than from sales directly to end users 
net sales consolidated net sales increased to million in  compared with million in and million in the most significant growth in was in the company s satcom segment  which benefited from the continued success of its aeronautical communications products including a new high speed terminal introduced during the year  as well as new contracts for its emergency management products 
the net revenue growth in for the space technology segment reflected much higher revenues recognized under new long term defense contracts and lower revenues recognized from older commercial space contracts which was expected  following the preceding year s strong revenues and declining order rate in commercial space 
for compared with  the most important factor in the company s sales growth was higher revenue in the space technology segment related to long term contracts for commercial space applications in particular  antennas and power control products 
also contributing to growth was the lxe segment  which had a successful rollout of new products in north america and europe  as well as the satcom segment  which experienced strong demand for its aeronautical communications products in the corporate jet market 
ems wireless revenues were affected by a slowdown in capital spending by the telecommunications industry in north america 
net sales and operating income by segment our segment net sales and operating income loss were as follows in thousands years ended december net sales space technology lxe ems wireless satcom other total operating income loss space technology contract reserve adjustment write down of netsat assets total space technology lxe ems wireless satcom other total space technology increasingly difficult market conditions caused commercial space orders to decline over the three years ended december   with the result that commercial space revenues and profits peaked in and decreased significantly in  furthermore  schedule delays and technical difficulties also contributed to lower profitability on commercial space contracts in however  orders for long term defense contracts were very low in but increased substantially in and  with the result that defense related revenues and profits grew over the three year period 
we expect that difficult market conditions in commercial space will persist in  but that defense markets will continue to improve 
we also believe that we have reduced our continuing financial risk on most of the large long term contracts that over recent years have presented serious technical  schedule and contractual challenges  but on a small number of programs we continue to address technical  schedule and contractual issues that  if not satisfactorily resolved  would materially affect our space technology revenues under the percentage completion method of accounting described in our critical accounting policies 
lxe in  lxe released the first models of a new generation of wireless products for logistics 
sales of these and other new products introduced over the next two years resulted in the modest growth of revenues and profits  despite generally sluggish conditions in capital goods markets  and we expect these trends to continue in the most active geographic markets for these products were in north america and europe 
ems wireless sales and profits from ems wireless base station antennas for pcs cellular communications peaked in  and declined in as capital spending in the telecommunications market slowed 
the results compared favorably with despite continued tough conditions in the telecommunications market  management believes this improvement was due to continued introduction of new products  improved order delivery times  and the segment establishing itself as an approved vendor to all major wireless carriers in the us we are uncertain whether the market for base station antennas will significantly improve in  but we are seeking to generate additional revenues through introduction of new products and broader market acceptance of our repeater products 
satcom most of satcom s sales over the three years ended december  have related to the corporate jet market  for which management believes that satcom is the leading supplier of advanced aeronautical communications products 
in  satcom s profits were reduced by additional costs to develop new products  including a highspeed data aeronautical terminal and enhanced land mobile terminals 
the rollout of these new products in helped increase sales and profits compared with the results also benefited from new contracts for emergency management products in particular  satellite based search and rescue systems 
we expect that our corporate jet revenues will significantly slow down in  but satcom s overall revenues should continue to grow based on defense and security opportunities for both our land mobile and aeronautical products 
cost of sales cost of sales  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  was in and compared with in the cost of sales percentage did not change in compared with  because the mix of sales by segment was comparable in both years 
in compared with  the sales mix was different  with the effect of higher space technology revenues with a higher cost of sales percentage slightly exceeding the effect of a decrease in ems wireless revenues with a lower cost of sales percentage 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  remained relatively stable at in compared with in and the dollar value increases in sg a for each of the past three years have related mainly to greater selling and marketing expenses to support geographic expansion and new product rollouts at the lxe  ems wireless and satcom segments 
research and development expenses research and development expenses r d represent the cost of our internally funded efforts 
significant r d efforts also occur under specific customer orders in the space technology segment and  accordingly  are reflected in cost of sales 
consolidated r d moderately decreased over the three year period ended december  the decrease in compared with was across the board in all segments 
the decrease in related mainly to the space technology segment  which shifted development efforts to customer funded initiatives  offsetting this decrease somewhat were increases at satcom to develop a high speed aeronautical terminal and at ems wireless to develop repeater products 
contract reserve adjustment in december  we accrued a million contract reserve  which represented an estimate of the loss to be incurred in settlement of a space technology contract 
under this contract  we were to develop and supply the crucial antenna technology for systems that provide multichannel  live television to commercial airline flights 
our customer was a partner in a joint venture that marketed these television systems to the airline industry 
we had worked with our customer on the contract for over three years and invested considerable time and expense  and the expectations were that the product rollout to the airline industry would have substantially begun by however  the rollout had proceeded much slower than expected  and the airline industry faced difficult economic conditions that had deteriorated significantly in late there were also considerable uncertainties at the end of about the timing of the airline industry s recovery and adoption of our technology 
based upon these factors  we concluded that sales under the contract were unlikely to develop at the previously expected rate  and we decided to seek a settlement of the contract with our customer  including possible use of the contract s provisions for dispute resolution 
in  while settlement negotiations were still in an early stage  the television system joint venture was acquired by a new airline that had been the joint venture s largest customer 
subsequently  we reached a new  long term agreement to supply the airline with advanced antennas 
based on the terms of the agreement and the strong financial position and creditworthiness of the new airline  we concluded that we no longer needed the million reserve 
the elimination of this reserve resulted in a statement of earnings benefit in the fourth quarter of write down of netsat assets effective as of december   we wrote down the full million value of certain receivables and inventories related to netsat company  llc netsat  which proposed to offer broadband communications services via a high capacity geostationary ka band satellite over the united states 
in september  we had negotiated an agreement to acquire control of netsat 
the acquisition was subject to approval by the federal communications commission fcc to transfer control of netsat s license to launch and operate its services 
in the first half of  prior to gaining control  we recorded million of receivables and inventory related to netsat s activities 
in mid  the fcc unexpectedly revoked netsat s license  based upon netsat s failure to begin satellite construction prior to a milestone date of may as a result  in we wrote down the full value of our netsat related receivables and inventories 
subsequent to an appeal by netsat  the fcc reinstated netsat s license and approved the transfer of control to us 
with other investors  we then established a new entity miraxis  llc to pursue a broadband communications business plan 
due to continuing uncertainty about whether the new venture can secure enough capital to proceed with its business plan  we have not attributed any value on the balance sheet to our minority investment in miraxis 
foreign exchange gain loss we recognize foreign exchange gains and losses related to an asset or liability denominated in a foreign currency  and if applicable  any embedded derivatives 
the most significant such gains and losses have been associated with us dollar denominated contracts from customers of our canadian subsidiary 
a stronger us dollar against the canadian dollar usually results in foreign exchange gains 
we also recognize net gains and losses from translation of the lxe european subsidiaries short term intercompany liabilities payable in us dollars 
these liabilities arise when the subsidiaries buy lxe products from the parent for resale in europe 
a weaker us dollar against the euro usually results in foreign exchange gains 
in  the net foreign currency gain of million resulted primarily from a period during the year when the us dollar strengthened against the canadian dollar 
due to the volatility of applicable us dollar exchange rates in  we increased our hedging activities in the second half of to reduce our future exposure to foreign currency changes 
foreign currency losses of  in and  in were the result of various changes in the us dollar against both the canadian dollar and euro 
non operating income the most significant item in non operating income was interest income of  in   in and  in these amounts vary with our level of cash on deposit 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million in  compared with million in and million in the decrease in was due to decreased debt levels that resulted from positive cash flow  and to lower interest rates 
the increase in from was due to higher average levels of debt 
income tax expense benefit the primary factor affecting our consolidated effective income tax rate each year is the relative proportion of taxable income that we earn in canada  where we have a much lower effective rate than in the us or other locations due to tax benefits for research related expenditures 
in  we earned almost all of our taxable income in the us and other locations  and the consolidated effective income tax rate was 
in  we recognized a consolidated net tax benefit despite reporting consolidated taxable income because we incurred a loss in for our combined operations in the us  where we have a higher effective tax rate  and we earned substantial taxable income in canada  where we have a lower effective rate 
therefore  the net tax benefit on the loss in the us exceeded the net tax expense on earnings in canada  resulting in a consolidated net tax benefit in in  we earned almost half of our taxable income in canada  and the resulting consolidated effective income tax rate compared very favorably with our effective tax rate outside of canada 
in  we expect to earn most of our taxable income in the us and other locations  as a result  the effective income tax rate in is expected to be approximately 
change in accounting principle in  we recorded an after tax loss from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  related to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
sfas no 
also establishes new accounting rules for hedging instruments which  depending on the nature of the hedge  require that changes in the fair value of derivatives must be either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any ineffective portion of a hedging instrument s change in fair value must be immediately recognized in earnings 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify as hedging instruments  any change in the value is recognized in current earnings 
upon the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
on january   we recorded a resulting net liability for all derivatives totaling  of which    after income taxes was charged to the statement of earnings as a transition adjustment for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
the remaining net liability for all derivatives was charged to the unbilled revenue component of accounts receivable  and to the other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
liquidity and capital resources during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared with million in and million in the company purchased million in fixed assets during during  the net repayment of long term debt was million 
this change included a million increase in the balances due under revolving credit arrangements and net repayments of term debt of approximately million 
at december   the company had million available for borrowing under its us revolving credit agreement and million available for borrowing under its canadian revolving credit agreement 
these credit agreements mature in  and the company expects to renew these agreements on terms that are comparable with the existing terms 
we expect that capital expenditures in will range from million to million 
these expenditures will be used primarily to purchase equipment that increases or enhances capacity and productivity 
the cash flow from operations during improved the company s cash position and its debt to equity ratio 
management believes that cash provided from operations and borrowings available under its credit agreements will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the operating and capital expenditure needs for existing operations during the next months 
to fund long term growth  the company may consider such measures as offerings of common stock or convertible securities 
commitments and contractual obligations the company does not have any undisclosed off balance sheet arrangements with an unconsolidated entity that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity  the availability of capital resources  or requirements for capital resources 
however  the following summary information about contractual obligations and commitments is provided to assist financial statement users 
following is the company s material contractual cash commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt  excluding capital leases capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations following is the company s material other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands amount of commitment expiration per period less than after other commercial commitments total year years years years standby letters of credit as performance guarantees risk factors and forward looking statements the company has included forward looking statements in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
actual results could differ materially from those suggested in any forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors 
such factors include  but are not limited to economic conditions in the us and abroad and their effect on capital spending in the company s principal markets  volatility of foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar and their effect on purchasing power by international customers  as well as the potential for realizing foreign exchange gains or losses associated with net foreign assets held by the company  successful resolution of technical problems  proposed scope changes  or proposed funding changes that may be encountered on contracts  changes in the company s consolidated effective income tax rate caused by the extent to which actual taxable earnings in the us  canada and other taxing jurisdictions may vary from expected taxable earnings  successful completion of technological development programs by the company and the effects of technology that may be developed by competitors  successful transition of products from development stages to an efficient manufacturing environment  customer response to new products and services  and general conditions in our target markets such as logistics  pcs cellular telephony and space based communications  the availability of financing for satellite data communications systems and for expansion of terrestrial pcs cellular phone systems  the extent to which terrestrial systems succeed in providing extensive broadband internet access on a dependable and economical basis  development of successful working relationships with local business and government personnel in connection with the distribution and manufacture of products in foreign countries  the growth rate of demand for various mobile and high speed data communications services  the company s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  particularly those with key technical skills  and the availability of sufficient additional credit or other financing  on acceptable terms  to support the company s expected growth 
effect of new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
over time  the liability is adjusted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
the company does not have any asset retirement obligations  and the adoption of this pronouncement will have no material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas no 
for example  sfas no 
provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of opinion no 
on how to present discontinued operations in the statement of earnings  but it broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business
