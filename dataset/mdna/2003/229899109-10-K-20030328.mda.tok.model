results of operations for the year ended december   cullen frost reported net income of million or per diluted common share  which is a record level for the corporation 
growth in earning assets which was funded primarily through growth in demand deposits  helped mitigate the effects of an unprecedented low rate environment 
in addition  a reduced provision for possible loan losses  steady growth in fee income and continued cost control efforts were also significant factors contributing to the strong performance

all of these factors are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow 

table of contents also included in the results was a pre tax gain of million related to the sale of an interest rate floor  which was purchased as a hedge against declining interest rates

net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and interest expense on liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings  which are used to fund those assets 
net interest income is the corporation s largest source of revenue  representing percent of total revenue in net interest margin is the taxable equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets for the period 
this measure is followed closely by the analyst community 
the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for was million  down slightly from million recorded in and down from the million for the net interest margin was percent for the year ended december   down from percent and percent for the years and  respectively 
the decrease in net interest income and the net interest margin from a year ago is primarily the result of the low interest rate environment 
with deposit costs currently at an historically low level  fixed rate assets continue to reprice lower as those assets paydown 
the federal funds rate generally the rate on one day loans of excess reserves from one bank to another declined an additional 
percent in  adding to the eleven reductions in  which totaled percent 
the corporation is primarily funded with core deposits  with demand deposits historically being a strong source of funds 
for  the ratio of average demand deposits to total average deposits was percent compared to percent for and percent for  which were well above peer levels 
this low cost funding base has historically been a positive to net interest income and margin 
however  in a falling rate environment  the corporation suffers margin compression as i earning assets reprice quicker than interest bearing liabilities and ii the low cost funding base results in an inability to cut these rates proportionately with decreases in market rates 
growth in deposits  primarily demand deposits  provided additional liquidity that led to growth in earning assets  which helped mitigate in part the negative impact of the low rate environment 
see consolidated average balance sheets on pages and and rate volume analysis on page net interest spread  which represents the difference between the rate earned on earning assets and the rates paid out on funds  was percent for compared to percent and percent for and  respectively 
the net interest spread  as well as the net interest margin  will be impacted by future changes in short term and long term interest rate levels  as well as the impact from the competitive environment 
a discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth at market risk disclosure interest sensitivity on page the corporation uses interest rate swaps  interest rate floors and caps  commonly referred to as derivatives  to manage exposure to interest rates 
information on these swaps  floors and caps is included on page and notes a  on page  and t  on page  to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents non interest income non interest income was million for  up million or percent when compared with million for  and up from million for growth in non interest income for the periods presented in the table below occurred primarily in two areas  service charges on deposits and insurance commissions  both discussed in further detail following the table 
year ended december percent percent percent non interest income amount change amount change amount change trust fees service charges on deposit accounts insurance commissions other service charges  commissions and fees net gain on securities transactions n m other total trust fees declined million or percent compared to a year ago due in part to lower investment fees  which were down million and account for approximately percent of total trust fees 
investment fees are based on the market value of assets within a trust account 
the continued decline and volatility in the equity markets negatively impacted the market value of trust assets and the related investment fees during the year 
as an indication of the drop in equity values  the s p was down approximately percent from a year ago 
oil and gas fees were also down from last year  decreasing by million 
accounts with oil and gas properties are charged based on energy prices  which were higher during relative to the declines in investment fees and oil and gas fees were partially offset by new revenue from securities lending of thousand and higher custody fees of thousand 
the securities lending program  which cullen frost began to offer in the fourth quarter of  offers institutional investors the opportunity to add incremental returns on their investment and pension portfolios by lending custodial held securities to broker dealers 
in  trust fees were down thousand or percent from  mainly due to the decline in investment fees of million  which was partially offset by higher oil and gas fees  which were up million 
the market value of trust assets at the end of was billion  down million or percent when compared to billion at the end of  with declines occurring in both managed and custody assets 
trust assets were comprised of managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion at year end compared to billion and billion  respectively  last year 
the market value of trust assets at the end of was billion  consisting of managed assets of billion and custody assets of billion 
service charges on deposits increased million or percent from primarily from higher treasury management revenues on commercial accounts 
these higher revenues resulted primarily from a lower earnings credit rate  as well as higher levels of billable services 
the earnings credit rate is the value given to deposits maintained by treasury management customers 
in a lower rate environment  deposit balances are not as valuable because of a lower earnings credit rate 
this results in customers paying for most of their services through fees rather than through the use of deposit balances 
in  deposit service charges increased million or percent from this increase resulted from higher revenues associated with both commercial and individual accounts 
the increase associated with commercial accounts primarily resulted from higher treasury management revenues due to a lower earnings credit rate and growth in billable services 
the increase in revenues from individual accounts continued to result from the simplification of deposit account offerings in and higher overdraft fees 
this simplification process resulted in fewer product offerings while enhancing the remaining available products ultimately resulting in a better value for the customer 

table of contents insurance commissions increased million or percent from a year ago 
the increase was the combined result of i continued selling efforts  ii the effect of a tighter market resulting in higher insurance premiums and related commission revenues  and iii the million impact from the ais acquisition during the third quarter of insurance commissions increased million or percent to million in from million in excluding the impact of the acquisition of ais  insurance commissions would have increased percent in from this increase was the combined result of the impact of continued selling efforts and the effect of higher insurance premiums on commission revenues  as the insurance market tightened the availability of certain products 
other service charges and fees increased thousand or percent when compared to the increase from a year ago was primarily related to higher corporate advisory fees  letter of credit fees  and money market income offset in part by lower income associated with the factoring of accounts receivable 
other service charges and fees increased thousand or percent from to the primary contributors to this growth were higher letters of credit and commitment fees as well as money market income 
other non interest income increased million or percent to million in compared to million in the increase from a year ago was impacted by i an increase in gains recognized on the sale of student loans up million  ii an increase in cash surrender value up million related to the bank owned life insurance program initiated in the second quarter of  iii higher annuity fee income up million as customers were looking for higher and more stable yields  and iv increased visa checkcard income  which was up due to a higher number of cards and increased usage 
partially offsetting this increase was the impact of the sale of a small data processing center during the first quarter of which resulted in million in lower revenues compared to last year 
also affecting the comparison was a million gain from the sale of an interest rate floor during other non interest income increased thousand or percent to million in compared to million in the increase in from was impacted by the purchase of bank owned life insurance on certain employees where the corporation is the beneficiary 
the increase in cash surrender value on these insurance policies during was million 
this revenue  combined with higher revenues received from the provider of the corporation s official checks program as a result of maintaining higher balances and the million gain from the sale of the interest rate floor  were the primary reasons for the increase 
these increases were partially offset by fewer mortgage loan origination fees  which resulted from the outsourcing of mortgage loan origination through a co branding arrangement with gmac mortgage 
a million non recurring pre tax gain from the sale of the mortgage servicing rights in and lower gains on the sale of student loans in partially offset the increase from 
table of contents non interest expense non interest expense was million for  which was down million or percent compared with million for and up from million for non interest expense would have been flat compared to after adjusting for the restructuring charges recorded in  which are included in the table and discussed below  and eliminating goodwill amortization  which totaled million in  due to the implementation of new accounting rules 
see note b accounting changes on page 
excluding the restructuring charge in  the majority of the increase from related to salaries and benefits 
year ended december percent percent percent non interest expense amount change amount change amount change salaries and wages employee benefits net occupancy furniture and equipment intangible amortization restructuring charges other total salaries and wages increased by thousand or 
percent in and million or percent in the change from a year ago was impacted by lower staffing levels resulting from actions taken in see the discussion on restructuring charges later in this section 
partially offsetting the change was the corporation s reinstatement of an accrual for potential performance related bonuses and higher salaries associated with fia s acquisition and its strong increase in revenues 
salaries and wages in experienced increases related to annual merit increases and acquisitions made by fia offset in part by the elimination of management bonuses for employee benefits decreased by thousand or percent during and were impacted by actions taken during which resulted in lower staffing levels and lower benefits expense 
these actions see the discussion on restructuring charges later in this section resulted in a decrease in most employee benefit costs  including retirement plan expense  k matching expense  payroll taxes and medical insurance costs 
these decreases were partially offset by costs associated with the new deferred profit sharing plan and higher workers compensation costs 
for the year compared to  pension and other employee benefits increased percent as a result of higher retirement plan expense  higher payroll taxes and higher medical expenses 
net occupancy expense decreased thousand or percent during primarily reflecting the benefit of lower lease expense resulting from the purchases of the twenty one story frost bank office tower and the adjacent parking garage facility in downtown san antonio  which were completed in the second quarter of this decrease was partially offset by higher lease expense related to various facilities  higher depreciation expense related to the purchased office tower and garage and costs associated with closing a branch location during in  net occupancy expense increased million or percent primarily reflecting higher general building maintenance and utility expenses and higher property tax expense related to a full year of operations for the two insurance acquisitions made in and five months of operations for the acquisition completed in august furniture and equipment costs decreased million or percent in primarily due to lower furniture and equipment depreciation down thousand and software maintenance costs down thousand 
in  furniture and equipment costs increased million or percent  which was largely due to higher software maintenance and amortization primarily related to the corporation s e commerce efforts and enhanced website introduced in november of 
table of contents intangible amortization for decreased million or percent from a year ago reflecting the non amortization of goodwill provisions of sfas no 
see note b accounting changes on page for further information 
intangible amortization for included million of goodwill amortization and million of other intangible amortization  primarily related to core deposit intangibles 
intangible amortization for included million of goodwill amortization and million of other intangible amortization  primarily related to core deposit intangibles 
the increase in amortized goodwill in from was due to goodwill associated with acquisitions by fia 
the restructuring charges recorded in included separation and benefit charges of million related to a voluntary early retirement program effective as of december   which was accepted by about four percent of the staff 
the million charge consisted of approximately million related to additional pension benefits  and million associated with future medical benefits  with the remainder due to cash payments based on length of service 
the restructuring charges also included million due to the freezing of the corporation s defined benefit and restoration plans  which were replaced by a deferred profit sharing plan 
the remaining million related to severance and outplacement services for a two percent reduction in workforce 
the freeze of the defined benefit and restoration plans and their replacement by the deferred profit sharing plan should reduce the volatility in retirement plan expense going forward 
however  the corporation still has funding obligations related to the defined benefit and restoration plans and could recognize retirement expense related to these plans in future years  which would be dependent on the return earned on plan assets  the level of interest rates and employee turnover 
at december   the corporation reduced the assumed discount rate associated with the liabilities of the defined benefit and restoration plans to percent from percent and reduced the projected return on plan assets for to percent from percent in cullen frost recognized combined expense  associated with the defined benefit and restoration plans of million in and  based on information received from its actuary  expects expenses associated with the defined benefit and restoration plans to be million 
future expense will be dependent upon a variety of factors  including the returns in the equity and bond markets 
other non interest expense increased million or percent during primarily due to higher federal reserve service charges 
these charges were up million and resulted from the lower interest rate environment  as the corporation paid more for services through fees than through the use of balances held at the federal reserve 
in addition  losses associated with foreclosed assets were up million and state sales and use taxes were up thousand 
lower attorney and other professional expenses  and a broad based decrease in operating expenses partially offset the increases 
other non interest expense increased million or percent during primarily due to higher professional and advertising expenses 
federal reserve service charges were also up due to the lower rate environment 
somewhat offsetting this increase in expenses were lower educational and telephone expenses 
results of segment operations the corporation s operations are managed along two operating segments banking and the financial management group fmg

table of contents banking net income was million for  up percent from million for and up from million for the increase in earnings in versus reflects slightly better net interest income  lower provision for possible loan losses  growth in fee income and expense control 
net interest income was up slightly due to the percent growth in average earning assets to billion for from billion for most of this increase in earning assets was due to growth in deposits which helped partially offset margin pressure from low rates 
the bank is primarily funded with non interest bearing demand deposits representing percent of average total deposits for this high level of demand deposits has been a positive for the bank s net interest income in the past 
in a falling rate environment  however  margin compression can occur more rapidly as rates on this funding source cannot go any lower 
the provision for possible loan losses decreased million from  as the provision level was impacted by the credit deterioration of two large credits and uncertainty in the economic environment during that period 
the loan loss reserve at the end of was million or percent of period end loans 
non interest income was up million primarily due to higher service charges on deposits and increased insurance commissions 
see the discussion below on fia 
the million increase in service charges on deposits  up percent over  can be attributed to higher treasury management fees on commercial accounts 
non interest expense for was down percent to million from million 
the decrease was impacted by the non amortization of goodwill under the new accounting rules  which resulted in a decrease in intangible amortization of million 
also contributing to the decrease were salaries and benefits  down million or percent as a result of the early retirement program and the reduction in workforce completed in the fourth quarter of fia  which is included in the banking operating segment  had gross revenues of million during  as compared with million in and million in insurance commissions were the largest component of these revenues and were up million or percent over  reflecting the impact of selling efforts and the effect of a tighter market for insurance products 
it also reflects the acquisition on august  of ais 
without ais  insurance commissions were up percent over last year 
referrals made by employees across the organization  including commercial banking  are an important source of growth for fia 
during  fia was successful on about percent of their proposals made to qualified referrals provided by other employees of the bank 
the million decrease in banking net income for when compared to reflects the impact of the million increase in the provision for possible loan losses  primarily related to the two credits mentioned above 
this decrease was partially offset by the pre tax gain of million related to the sale of an interest rate floor  and a million increase in service charges on deposits 
financial management group net income for was million  compared to million for and million for net interest income was down million compared to the previous year as the lower rate environment has reduced the funds transfer price paid on fmg s securities sold under repurchase agreements

annuity fees were up as customers were looking for higher and more stable yields and the securities lending program was initiated in the fourth quarter of see the discussion on trust fees in the non interest income section on page for further information 
non interest expense was down million from last year 
most of the decrease was due to lower charges from outside professionals

the purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment 
while some short term loans may be made on an unsecured basis  most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with the corporation s loan policy guidelines 
the commercial and industrial loan portfolio also includes the commercial lease portfolio and asset based lending 
at december   the commercial lease portfolio totaled million and asset based loans totaled million

these participations are made in the normal course of business to meet the needs of the corporation s customers 
general corporate policy toward participations is to lend to companies either headquartered in or having significant operations within the corporation s markets

the student loan portfolio decreased million to million at december   from million at december  this decrease is a result of the acceleration in sales during the second quarter of of loans that would have normally been sold in the ordinary course of business over an extended period of time 
the indirect consumer loan segment has continued to decrease since the corporation s decision to discontinue originating these types of loans during at december   the majority of the million portfolio was comprised of purchased home improvement and home equity loans percent of total  as well as new and used automobile loans percent of total 
the portfolio is not expected to completely pay off by year end due to the longer life of the non auto loans in this portfolio 
however  the portfolio is expected to be substantially reduced by that time 
the corporation also discontinued originating family residential mortgage loans in these types of loans are now offered through the corporation s co branding arrangement with gmac mortgage 
at december   the family residential loan segment totaled million down from million at 
table of contents year end although this portfolio will continue to decline due to the decision to withdraw from the mortgage origination business  the high level of mortgage refinances during s low interest rate environment drove the substantial decrease during the following table details the corporation s total loan portfolio by a regional breakout at year end and the other portfolios category includes indirect lending  family residential mortgages  sncs and student loans 
the decreases in the major components of this category have been previously discussed 
december percent change loans by region in millions houston san antonio fort worth austin dallas corpus christi rio grande valley other portfolios total the majority of the loan growth in dollars occurred in the higher growth markets of fort worth and houston  which are two important and growing texas markets 
part of this growth resulted from the fact that the corporation has a smaller market share in these regions 
the corporation has sought to expand its market share by i growing business through customers who previously did business with banks with larger market shares in these regions  and ii hiring new loan officers  primarily from banks with larger market shares 
the stable loan balance in the san antonio region is reflective of the mature market share that the corporation has achieved in its headquarters market 
the growth in the austin region for from reflects a stabilizing economy in that market after a difficult year in influenced by the decline in their technology sector 
loans to borrowers in mexico  which are secured by liquid assets held in the united states  were million  million  and million for the years ended   and  respectively 
cullen frost s cross border outstandings to mexico excluding these loans totaled thousand  thousand  and thousand at december    and  respectively 
at december    and  none of the mexico related loans were on non performing status 
loan commitments in the normal course of business  in order to meet the financial needs of its customers  cullen frost is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit which commit the corporation to make payments to or on behalf of customers when certain specified future events occur 
both arrangements have credit risk essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and are subject to the corporation s normal credit policies 
collateral is obtained based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
commitments to extend credit to borrowers with criticized credit are included in the calculation of the allowance for possible loan losses 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit amounted to billion and million  respectively  at december   and billion and million  respectively  at december  acceptances due from customers at december  were million  which was unchanged from the previous year 

table of contents non performing assets non performing assets were million at december   compared with million at december   and million at december  non performing assets include non accrual loans and foreclosed assets 
loans are classified as non accrual if interest income is not currently accrued because of the borrower s financial problems 
foreclosed assets represent property acquired as a result of borrower defaults on loans 
the million increase in non performing assets from last year is primarily due to higher levels of foreclosed assets  which increased million 
most of the increase is related to a single borrower with two single family land development properties 
the million increase in non accrual loans was primarily related to loans in the commercial and industrial category 
the increase in non performing assets from to was due to two large sncs that went on non accrual status during one loan  to an electronics distribution company  went on non accrual status during the first quarter of approximately million of this credit was charged off  with million remaining in non accrual loans at december  at year end  the remaining balance of this loan on non accrual status had amortized down to million 
the second loan  which went on non accrual status in the third quarter of  was made to a private company in the marketing and sales promotion industry  an industry that was dramatically affected by the terrorist attack on september  approximately million of the second loan was charged off  which resulted in million remaining in non accrual loans at december  during the second quarter of  the corporation sold its remaining interests in this non accrual loan with a carrying value of million 
this transaction resulted in a recovery of million  which was credited against the allowance for possible loan losses 
non performing assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed assets were 
percent at december   compared to 
percent one year ago 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 
percent for both year ends and december non performing assets non accrual loans foreclosed assets total as a percentage of total assets as a percentage of total loans plus foreclosed assets after tax impact of lost interest per common share accruing loans days past due consumer all other total cullen frost did not have any restructured loans for the years ended december  interest income that would have been recorded in on non performing assets  had such assets performed in accordance with their original contract terms  was million on non accrual loans and thousand on foreclosed assets 
during  the amount of interest income actually recorded on non accrual loans was thousand 
there were no foreign loans days past due as of december  
table of contents loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for non accrual status whether or not the loan is days or more past due 
consumer loan collectibility and loss are typically determined prior to the loan being days past due 
losses on consumer loans are taken at the time they are determined 
consumer loans over days past due are either in liquidation payment status or bankruptcy awaiting confirmation of a plan 
all non consumer loans days or more past due are classified as non accrual unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest income is not recognized until collected  and any previously accrued but uncollected interest is reversed 
a loan is considered as restructured if it has been modified as to original terms  resulting in a reduction or deferral of principal and or interest as a concession to the debtor that the creditor would not otherwise consider 
classification of an asset in the non performing category does not preclude collection of loan principal or interest 
potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of the obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of the obligor s potential operating or financial difficulties 
management monitors these loans closely and reviews their performance on a regular basis 
at december   cullen frost had million in loans of this type which had not been included in either of the non accrual or days past due loan categories 
approximately percent of the total is related to a single credit to a company in several gas related and equipment distribution businesses 
recent weakness in such company s operating performance combined with a slowdown in certain business sectors has caused us to heighten the attention given to this credit 
also included in potential problem loans  but unrelated to the previously discussed credit  is a single credit in the amount of million  which went on non accrual status during the first quarter of allowance for possible loan losses the allowance for possible loan losses was million or percent of period end loans at december   compared to million or percent of period end loans at year end the allowance for possible loan losses as a percentage of non accrual loans was percent at december   compared with percent at december  the allowance for possible loan losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate by management  based on estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio 
cullen frost recorded a million provision for possible loan losses during  compared to million and million recorded during and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for possible loan losses in was due to the two previously discussed snc loans and reflected the increased uncertainty in the economy since the terrorist acts of september   combined with the economic downturn already in progress at that time 
cullen frost recorded net charge offs of million for  compared to net charge offs of million and million in and  respectively 
charge offs are loan balances that have been written off against the allowance for possible loan losses once the loan is determined to be uncollectible 
as a percentage of average loans  net charge offs were 
percent for compared to 
percent last year 
gross charge offs in consisted primarily of commercial and industrial charge offs of million  consumer charge offs of million and real estate charge offs of million 
compared to  commercial and industrial charge offs were down million as last year was impacted by the two large snc non accrual loans discussed in the non performing assets section on page consumer loan charge offs were down million from last year due to lower indirect lending charge offs  a product that we stopped originating in

the specific allowances are based on a regular analysis and evaluation of criticized loans 
the quality of loans are determined based on an internal credit risk grading process that evaluates i the obligor s ability to repay  ii the underlying collateral  if any  and iii the economic environment and industry in which the borrower operates 
this analysis is performed at the relationship manager level for all commercial loans 
loans with a calculated grade that is below a predetermined grade a re viewed as criticized 
once criticized  a loan is analyzed at least quarterly by a special assets officer to determine if a specific allowance is needed 
specific allocations are based on a borrower s inability or unwillingness to repay  collateral deficiencies and risk grade  and or the state of the borrower s industry 
if a specific allowance is not assigned to a criticized loan  and the 
table of contents loan is not determined to be impaired  the loan is included in the historical loan loss experience allowance portion of the process for loans with similar characteristics 
historical allowances are determined statistically using a loss analysis that examines the loss experience of the portfolio in total  by specific loan types and the related internal grading of loans charged off 
this loss analysis is periodically updated based on actual experience 
the analysis is performed on several groups of loans and includes unfunded loan commitments 
accordingly  several historical allowance pools result 
specifically  historical allowance pools exist for similarly risk graded groups of commercial real estate loans  commercial and industrial loans  consumer loans and family residential mortgages 
unallocated allowances based on general economic conditions and other internal and external risk factors are determined by evaluating the experience  ability and effectiveness of the bank s lending management and staff  effectiveness of lending policies and procedures and internal controls  changes in asset quality  changes in loan portfolio volume  composition and concentrations of credit  impact of competition on loan structuring and pricing  effectiveness of the internal loan review  impact of environmental risks on portfolio risks  and impact of rising interest rates on portfolio risk 
quarterly  senior management evaluates the degree of risk that each one of these components has on the quality of the loan portfolio 
each component is determined to have either a high  moderate or low degree of risk 
the results are then input into a general allocation matrix to determine the unallocated general allowance 
while the loss analysis for the historical allowance is performed annually  the corporation may revise the general allocation factors whenever necessary in order to address improving or deteriorating credit quality trends or events or recognize specific risks associated with a given loan concentration or pool classification 
cullen frost has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk 
these policies and procedures  some of which are described below  are reviewed regularly by senior management 
a reporting system supplements this review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production  loan quality  concentrations of credit  loan delinquencies and non performing and potential problem loans 
diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions 
commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business 
once it is determined that the borrower s management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen  current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability to repay their obligations as agreed 
underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking 
while some short term loans may be made on an unsecured basis  most are secured by the assets being financed 
the diversity of the corporation s commercial real estate portfolio allows us to reduce the impact of a decline in a single market or industry 
management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral  geography and risk grade criteria 
as a general rule  single purpose projects are avoided unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate the risk 
we also utilize the knowledge of third party experts to provide insight and guidance about the economic conditions and dynamics of the markets served by the corporation 
in addition  management tracks the level of owner occupied commercial real estate loans versus non owner occupied loans 
at december   percent of the corporation s commercial real estate loans were secured by owner occupied properties 
these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate 
consequently  these loans must withstand the analysis of a commercial loan and the underwriting process of a commercial real estate loan 
loans secured by non owner occupied commercial real estate are made to developers and builders who have a relationship with cullen frost and who have a proven record of success 
these loans are underwritten through the use of feasibility studies  independent appraisal reviews  sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners 
sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre committed permanent loans from approved long term lenders  sales of developed property or an interim mini perm loan commitment from the corporation until permanent financing is obtained 
these loans are closely monitored by on site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate 
table of contents loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes  general economic conditions and the availability of long term financing 
a computer based credit scoring analysis is used to supplement the consumer loan underwriting process 
to monitor and manage consumer loan risk  policies and procedures are developed and modified  as needed  jointly by line and staff personnel 
this activity  coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers  minimizes the risk 
additionally  trend and outlook reports are provided to senior management on a frequent basis to aid in planning 
underwriting standards for home equity loans are heavily influenced by statutory requirements  which include  but are not limited to  a maximum loan to value percentage of percent  collection remedies  the number of such loans a borrower can have at one time and documentation requirements 
cullen frost has an independent loan review division that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis 
results of these reviews are presented to senior management 
loan review s function complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel  as well as the corporation s policies and procedures 
loans identified as losses by management  internal loan review and or bank examiners are charged off 
furthermore  consumer loan accounts are charged off automatically based on regulatory requirements 
an allowance for possible loan losses is maintained in an amount which  in management s judgment  provides an adequate reserve to absorb probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as loan losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the following table provides an allocation of the year end allowance for possible loan losses by loan type december allowance allowance allowance allowance allowance for as a for as a for as a for as a for as a possible percentage possible percentage possible percentage possible percentage possible percentage loan of total loan of total loan of total loan of total loan of total losses loans losses loans losses loans losses loans losses loans commercial and industrial real estate consumer purchasing or carrying securities financial institutions other  including foreign unallocated total allocation of a portion of the allowance does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories 
the reserve allocations for commercial loans were increased in response to the softening economy during also during the corporation assessed the impact on consumer loan losses of its decision two years ago to exit indirect consumer lending 
since exiting indirect lending  consumer loan losses have declined significantly 
in response to this decline in loan losses  the corporation reduced the consumer reserve allocation in line with the lower risk in the consumer portfolio 
the unallocated reserve increased in and in response to deterioration in the economy and the impact of the terrorist attacks of september  both events led to a higher risk environment for loan portfolios 
we responded to this higher risk environment by increasing unallocated reserves based on risk factors thought to increase with the slowing economy

in a dollar roll  the transaction contract explicitly allows for returning similar  but not necessarily identical securities to the bank 
a dollar roll will leverage up the balance sheet as it is basically a borrowing  but the corporation is able to enter into such transactions at favorable borrowing rates 
commitments to return collateral related to securities loaned under dollar roll agreements accounted for million of the growth in federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements from year end off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments assets under management and assets under custody are held in fiduciary or custodial capacity for the corporation s customers

on behalf of its customers  the corporation lends customer securities to creditworthy brokers 
cullen frost indemnifies its customers for the fair market value of those securities against a failure by the borrower to return such securities 
collateral received in securities lending transactions are held as agent and  as such  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not assets of the corporation 
cullen frost requires borrowers to provide collateral greater than or equal to percent of the fair market value of the securities borrowed 
the collateral is valued daily and additional collateral is requested as necessary

cullen frost seeks to ensure that these needs are met at a reasonable cost by maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset liability management 
asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future 
liquid assets include cash  short term time deposits in banks  securities available for sale  maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity  and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements

the liquidity position of cullen frost is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate 
interest rate swaps caps floors cullen frost uses interest rate swaps  caps and floors to hedge its interest rate risk 
the corporation had fair value type commercial loan lease interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million at december   and fair value type commercial loan lease interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million at december  these loan lease interest rate swaps essentially convert fixed rate loans into floating rate loans 
the corporation had one fair value type interest rate cap with a notional amount of million at december  in and  each interest rate swap and cap was a hedge against a specific commercial fixed rate loan lease  with remaining lives ranging from approximately one month to ten years 
for and  the scheduled reductions of the interest rate swaps notional amount generally matched the expected amortization of the underlying loan lease 
in  the corporation s derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities were all designated as fair value type hedges  which were required to meet specific criteria in order to receive hedge accounting treatment 
for fair value type hedges  the changes in fair values of both the hedging derivative and the hedged item were recorded in current earnings as other income or other expense  and were immaterial in and also in  interest rate swaps were terminated to mitigate interest rate risk exposure associated with potential future interest rate decreases 
the termination of these interest rate swaps essentially converted the swapped loans back to fixed rate instruments 
the fair value adjustment for the hedged loans when terminated was million  and is being amortized over the remaining life of the associated loans 
in  cullen frost entered into a fair value type interest rate swap agreement related to the million fixed rate subordinated debt issued in which essentially converted the debt to a floating instrument 
the swap agreement has an effective notional amount of million over a remaining period of four years 
in  the corporation entered into an interest rate floor three year agreement with a notional amount totaling billion 
the interest rate floor was a hedge of interest rate exposure associated with commercial loan accounts in an environment of falling rates 
the floor agreement was sold during the first quarter of under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities adopted on january  see note a  financial derivatives section on page  the interest rate floor did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and in management s opinion would have introduced excessive volatility into earnings 
for a discussion of the gain from the sale  see page interest rate swap and floor contracts involve the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet contractual terms 
each counterparty to a swap transaction is approved by cullen frost s asset liability management committee alco or the committee and has a credit rating that is investment grade

table of contents market risk disclosure interest rate sensitivity in the ordinary course of business  cullen frost s market risk is primarily that of interest rate risk 
the corporation s interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are monitored on an ongoing basis by the alco 
the committee seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates 
a variety of measures are used to provide for a comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk  the distribution of risk  level of risk over time and exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
cullen frost utilizes an earnings simulation model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates 
the model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net income over the next months 
the model was used to measure the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario of rates increasing over time basis points or decreasing over time basis points due to the already low level of short term rates over the next months 
these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix  pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet 
the impact of interest rate derivatives  such as interest rate swaps is also included in the model 
other interest rate related risks such as prepayment  basis and option risk are also considered 
the resulting model simulations show that a basis point increase in rates will result in a positive variance in net interest income of percent relative to the base case over the next months  while a decrease of basis points will result in a negative variance in net interest income of percent relative to the base case over the next months 
this compares to last year s estimate when a basis points increase in rates resulted in a positive variance in net interest income of percent relative to the base case over the next months  while a decrease of basis points resulted in a negative variance in net interest income of percent 
the corporation s trading portfolio is immaterial  and  as such  separate quantitative disclosure is not presented 
the committee continuously monitors and manages the balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the objective is to manage the impact of fluctuating market rates on net interest income within acceptable levels 
in order to meet this objective  management may lengthen or shorten the duration of assets or liabilities or enter into derivative contracts to mitigate potential market risk

the total allowance for possible loan losses includes activity related to allowances calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and activity related to other loan loss allowances determined in accordance with sfas no

certain non homogeneous loans are accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
this standard requires an allowance to be established as a component of the allowance for loan losses for certain loans when it is probable that all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan will not be collected

in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  which can significantly impact the estimated fair value 
as such  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of stock options
