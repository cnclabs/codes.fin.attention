item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this information is incorporated by reference to the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in sungard s annual report to stockholders included in exhibit to this report on form k 
this information should be read together with the company s consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in exhibit to this report on form k and the discussion of risk factors below 
risk factors this report on form k and other sungard reports and communications contain forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time  and  therefore  actual results may differ materially from expected results 
forward looking statements include information about possible or assumed future financial results of the company and usually contain words such as believes  intends  expects  anticipates  or similar expressions 
sungard derives most of its forward looking statements from its operating budgets and forecasts  which are based upon many detailed assumptions 
while sungard believes that its assumptions are reasonable  it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in predicting certain important risk factors  including the effect of general economic conditions on information technology spending levels  trading volumes and services revenues  the overall condition of the financial services industry and the effect of any further consolidation among financial services firms  the effect of war  terrorism or catastrophic events  the timing and magnitude of software sales  the timing and scope of technological advances  including those resulting in more alternatives for dedicated high availability services  the integration and performance of acquired businesses  including the availability services business of guardian it plc  acquired on july   the satisfaction of conditions to closing of pending acquisitions  the prospects for future acquisitions  the ability to retain and attract customers and key personnel  and the ability to obtain patent protection and avoid patent related liabilities in the context of a rapidly developing legal framework for software and business method patents 
consider these risk factors carefully in evaluating sungard s forward looking statements and in making any investment decision regarding sungard s common stock 
furthermore  remember that the risk factors described in this report on form k are not the only ones facing sungard 
there may be additional risks and uncertainties that sungard does not currently know about or that sungard currently believes are not material 
if any of the risk factors facing sungard come to pass  then there could be a material adverse affect on sungard s business  financial condition or future results of operations 
if that happens  the trading price of sungard s common stock could drop  and a sungard investor could lose a substantial part of his or her investment 
sungard assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
general economic and market conditions may hurt sungard s business and results 
when there is a slowdown or downturn in the economy  a drop in stock market trading volumes  or an event that disrupts the financial markets such as  sungard s business and financial results may suffer for a number of reasons 
for example  customers may react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their spending on information technology 
in addition  customers may curtail or discontinue trading operations  delay or cancel information technology projects  or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts 
moreover  competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away customers to lower cost solutions 
if any of these circumstances remain in effect for an extended period of time  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
weakening of the financial services industry may hurt sungard s business and results 
since sungard s customer base is concentrated in the financial services industry  its business is largely dependent on the well being of that industry 
when there is a general downturn in the financial services industry  or if sungard s customers in that industry experience financial or business problems  sungard s business and financial results may suffer 
in addition  if financial services firms continue to consolidate as they have over the past decade  there could be a material adverse effect on sungard s business and financial results 
for example  when a sungard customer merges with a firm using its own solution or another vendor s solution  they could decide to consolidate their processing on a non sungard system  which could have an adverse effect on sungard s financial results 
catastrophic events may disrupt sungard s business and hurt its results 
sungard s business may be adversely affected by a war  terrorist attack  natural disaster or other catastrophe 
a catastrophic event could have a direct negative impact on sungard or an indirect impact on sungard by  for example  affecting sungard s customers  the financial markets or the overall economy 
the potential for a direct impact is due primarily to the company s significant investment in its infrastructure 
although sungard maintains redundant facilities and has contingency plans in place to protect against both man made and natural threats  it is impossible to fully anticipate and protect against all potential catastrophes 
despite the company s preparations  a security breach  criminal act  military action  power or communication failure  flood  severe storm or the like could lead to service interruptions and data losses for customers  disruptions to sungard s operations  or damage to important sungard facilities 
any of these could have a material adverse effect on sungard s business and financial results 
the unpredictability of software sales may cause sungard s results to fluctuate 
sungard s operating results may fluctuate and be difficult to predict due to the timing and magnitude of software sales 
sungard offers some of its investment support systems on a license basis  which means that the customer has the right to run the software on its own computers 
the customer usually makes a significant up front payment to license software  which the company generally recognizes as revenue when the license contract is signed and the software is delivered 
the size of the up front payment often depends on a number of factors that are different for each customer  such as the number of customer locations  users or accounts 
as a result  the sales cycle for a software license may be lengthy and take unexpected turns 
that is why it is difficult to predict when software sales will occur or how much revenue they will generate 
since there are few incremental costs associated with software sales  sungard s operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing and magnitude of software sales 
rapid technological and business changes may cause problems for sungard 
sungard s business may suffer if it does not successfully adapt its services and software to changes in technology and changes in its customers businesses 
these changes can occur rapidly and at unpredictable intervals 
if sungard does not successfully update and integrate its services and software to adapt to these changes  or if sungard does not successfully develop new products needed by its customers to keep pace with these changes  then sungard s business and financial results may suffer 
sungard s ability to keep up with technology and business changes is subject to a number of risks  including sungard may find it difficult or costly to update its services and software and to develop new products fast enough to meet its customers needs  sungard may find it difficult or costly to make some features of its services and software work effectively and securely over the internet  sungard may find it difficult or costly to integrate more of its investment support systems into efficient straight through processing solutions  sungard may find it difficult or costly to update its services and software to keep pace with business  regulatory and other developments in the financial services industry  where many of sungard s customers operate  sungard s availability services margins may decline if new technologies accelerate the emerging trend toward increasing sales of dedicated availability services dedicated services yield lower margins than shared services because the equipment and facilities involved are not shared by multiple customers but rather used exclusively by a single customer  and sungard may be exposed to liability for security breaches that allow unauthorized persons to gain access to confidential information stored on sungard s computers or transmitted over its network 
difficulties integrating acquisitions may adversely affect sungard s business and results 
there can be no assurance that sungard s acquisition program will continue to be successful 
if sungard is unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses  or if acquired businesses perform poorly  then sungard s business and financial results may suffer 
the largest business acquired by sungard in was the availability solutions business of guardian it plc 
although the integration of the guardian business has proceeded well  it is possible that the guardian business and other businesses acquired by sungard may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than expected 
if that happens  there may be a material adverse effect on sungard s business and financial results for a number of reasons  including sungard may have to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to acquired businesses  sungard may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from its acquisitions  and sungard may have to write off goodwill or other intangible assets 
difficulties finding future acquisitions on favorable terms may hurt sungard s growth 
sungard s growth has depended in part on its ability to acquire similar or complementary businesses on favorable terms 
this growth strategy is subject to a number of risks that could adversely affect sungard s business and financial results  including sungard may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms  sungard may face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirors or from the possibility of the acquisition target pursuing an initial public offering of its stock  sungard may have to borrow money from a bank or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance future acquisitions  and sungard may find it more difficult or costly to complete acquisitions due to changes in accounting  tax  securities or other regulations 
sungard s success depends on retaining and attracting customers 
if sungard is unable to keep existing customers satisfied  sell additional services and software to existing customers or attract new customers  then sungard s business and financial results may suffer 
a variety of factors could affect sungard s ability to successfully retain and attract customers  including the level of demand for sungard s services and software  the level of customer spending for information technology  the level of competition from internal customer solutions and from other vendors  the quality of sungard s customer service  the ability of sungard to update its products and develop new products needed by customers  and the ability of sungard to integrate and manage acquired businesses 
sungard s services revenue  which has been largely recurring in nature  comes from the sale of its services and software under fixed term contracts 
sungard does not have a unilateral right to extend these contracts when they expire 
if customers cancel or refuse to renew their contracts  or if customers reduce the usage levels or asset values under their contracts  there could be a material adverse effect on sungard s business and financial results 
in availability services  customer retention risks have been amplified by recent acquisitions 
compared to sungard s historical availability services customer base  the customer base acquired in november with the availability solutions business of comdisco  inc had a greater concentration of revenue in a smaller number of accounts and a shorter average remaining term 
the availability services customer base acquired from guardian in july has average revenue per customer similar to sungard s  but also has a shorter average remaining contract term 
consequently  the amount and percentage of annual availability services revenue that is subject to renewal significantly increased 
as the company seeks to renew shorter term availability services contracts  it often agrees to lower monthly fees in exchange for longer contract commitments  which is currently having a negative impact on revenues and revenue growth rates in this segment 
sungard s success depends on retaining and attracting skilled employees 
sungard s success depends on the skill  experience and dedication of its employees 
if sungard is unable to retain and attract sufficiently experienced and capable personnel  especially in product development  sales and management  sungard s business and financial results may suffer 
for example  if sungard is unable to retain and attract a sufficient number of skilled technical personnel  its ability to develop high quality products and provide high quality customer service may be impaired 
experienced and capable personnel in the it industry remain in high demand  and there is continual competition for their talents 
when talented employees leave  sungard may have difficulty replacing them  and its business may suffer 
there can be no assurance that sungard will be able to successfully retain and attract the personnel that it needs 
difficulties protecting proprietary technology and evolving patent laws may cause problems for sungard 
sungard s success is dependent in part on its ability to protect its proprietary services and software and to defend against infringement claims 
if sungard is unable to do so  sungard s business and financial results may suffer 
to protect its proprietary technology  sungard relies upon a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret law  confidentiality restrictions in contracts with employees  customers and others  software security measures  and registered copyrights and patents see proprietary protection under item 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary technology  unauthorized persons may be able to copy  reverse engineer or otherwise use some of sungard s technology 
it also is possible that others will develop and market similar or superseding technology to compete with sungard 
furthermore  existing patent and copyright laws may afford only limited protection  and the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary technology as well as united states law 
for these reasons  sungard may have difficulty protecting its proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use 
if any of these events happens  there could be a material adverse effect on the value of sungard s proprietary technology and on its business and financial results 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to protect the company s proprietary technology 
this type of litigation is often costly and time consuming  with no assurance of success 
the legal framework for software and business method patents is rapidly evolving  and it is possible that others may patent technology similar to sungard s and may assert infringement claims against sungard 
these claims may be difficult and costly to defend and may lead to unfavorable judgments or settlements  which could have a material adverse effect on sungard s business and financial results 
for these reasons  sungard may find it difficult or costly to add or retain important features in its services and software
