item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview through its subsidiaries and joint venture arrangements  the company s principal business segment is primarily dedicated to operating a diversified fleet of offshore support vessels that service oil and gas exploration and production facilities mainly in the us gulf of mexico  the north sea  latin america  west africa and asia 
the company s vessels deliver cargo and personnel to offshore installations  handle anchors for drilling rigs and other marine equipment  support offshore construction and maintenance work and provide standby safety support and oil spill response services 
from time to time  vessels service special projects  such as well stimulation  seismic data gathering and freight hauling 
in addition to vessel services  the company s offshore marine service business offers logistics services  which include shorebase  marine transport and other supply chain management services also in support of offshore oil and gas exploration and production operations 
the company is also a leading provider of oil spill response services to owners of tank vessels and oil storage  processing and handling facilities 
the company operates an inland river barge business  and until the chiles merger on august   the company held a equity interest in chiles  a former owner and operator of ultra premium jackup drilling rigs 
on december   the company completed the acquisition of tex air  a company providing helicopter transportation services primarily to oil and gas companies operating in the us gulf of mexico 
offshore marine services the company s offshore marine service segment provides marine transportation  logistics and related services primarily dedicated to supporting oil and gas exploration and production 
since its inception  the company has actively monitored opportunities to buy and sell vessels to maximize the overall utility and flexibility of its fleet 
fleet growth has occurred principally through the purchase of vessels from competitors and equity holdings in joint ventures that own vessels and through construction of new equipment 
since and in support of fleet expansion  the company has regularly deposited proceeds from the sale of many of its vessels into construction reserve fund accounts for the express purposes of acquiring newly constructed us flag vessels and qualifying for the company s temporary deferral of taxable gains realized from the sale of those vessels 
see liquidity and capital resources cash and marketable securities for additional discussion of construction reserve funds 
the offshore marine service segment s operating revenues are primarily affected by the number of vessels owned and bareboat and time chartered in  as well as rates per day worked and utilization of the company s fleet 
overall utilization for any vessel with respect to any period is the ratio of aggregate number of days worked by such vessel to total calendar days available during such period 
the rate per day worked for any vessel with respect to any period is the ratio of total time charter revenue of such vessel to the aggregate number of days worked by such vessel for such period 
rates per day worked and utilization of the company s fleet are a function of demand for and availability of marine vessels  which are closely aligned with the level of exploration and development of offshore areas 
the level of exploration and development of offshore areas is affected by both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices  which in turn are related to the demand for petroleum products and the current availability of oil and gas resources 
over the three year period from through  demand for offshore rigs peaked in march at rigs and declined to approximately rigs at year end  where it has remained through year end the decline in offshore rig demand has been greatest in the us gulf of mexico 
drilling activity has traditionally been linked to the cash flow of oil and gas companies  which is directly related to oil and natural gas commodity prices 
high oil and natural gas prices have historically resulted in greater drilling activity  which increases the demand for the company s services 
the decline in rig demand since has tracked oil and natural gas commodity prices until recently 
although oil and natural gas prices have increased during the second half of and risen further in  this has yet to produce an increase in drilling activity 
while the company remains hopeful that drilling demand will pick up in  the year began with less offshore activity than during the same period in in most of the major markets in which the company operates 
the table below sets forth rates per day worked and utilization data for the company s fleet during the periods indicated 
year ended december  fleet rates per day worked anchor handling towing supply    crew    geophysical  freight and other   mini supply    standby safety    supply and towing supply    utility    overall utilization anchor handling towing supply crew geophysical  freight and other mini supply standby safety supply and towing supply utility overall fleet rates per day worked and overall utilization figures exclude owned vessels that are bareboat chartered out  vessels owned by corporations that participate in pooling arrangements with the company  minority owned joint venture vessels and managed vessels and include vessels bareboat and time chartered in by the company 
revenues for certain of the company s vessels included in the calculation of rates per day worked  primarily its north sea fleet  are earned in foreign currencies  primarily pounds sterling  and have been converted to us dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the periods indicated 
from time to time  the company bareboat or time charters in vessels 
a bareboat charter is a vessel lease under which the lessee charterer is responsible for all crewing  insurance  and other operating expenses  as well as the payment of bareboat charter hire to the providing entity 
a time charter is a lease under which the entity providing the vessel is responsible for all crewing  insurance  and other operating expenses and the charterer only pays a time charter hire fee to the providing entity 
operating revenues for vessels owned and bareboat or time chartered in are earned at similar rates 
however  operating expenses associated with vessels that are bareboat and time chartered in include charter hire expenses that  in turn  are included in vessel expenses  but exclude depreciation expense 
the company earns operating revenues primarily from the time or bareboat charter out of vessels  which are owned or bareboat or time chartered in 
operating revenues earned from the bareboat charter out of vessels are generally lower than for vessels owned and operated or bareboat chartered in by the company  because vessel expenses  normally recovered through charter revenue  are the burden of the charterer 
at various times  the company provides management services to other vessel owners 
charter revenues and vessel expenses of managed vessels are not included in operating results  but the company does recognize a management fee in operating revenues 
the table below sets forth the company s fleet structure at the dates indicated 
at december  fleet structure domestic owned bareboat chartered in managed joint ventures and pools foreign owned bareboat chartered in managed joint ventures and pools the number of vessels chartered in by the company has increased since due primarily to sale leaseback transactions 
see item business joint ventures and pooling arrangements 
there were no domestic and foreign pooled vessels at december  of those vessels which are joint ventured  participated in joint ventures in which the company owned less than a majority interest  participated in joint ventures in which the company owned the majority interest and were chartered in 
vessel operating expenses are primarily a function of fleet size and utilization levels 
the most significant vessel operating expense items are wages paid to marine personnel  maintenance and repairs and marine insurance 
in addition to variable vessel operating expenses  the offshore marine business segment incurs fixed charges related to the depreciation of property and equipment and charter in hire 
depreciation is a significant operating expense and the amount related to vessels is the most significant component 
drydocking repairs  which are a substantial component of a vessel s maintenance costs  are expensed when incurred 
under applicable maritime regulations  vessels must be drydocked twice in a five year period for inspection by regulatory authorities 
the company follows an asset management strategy pursuant to which it defers required drydocking of selected vessels and voluntarily removes these vessels from operation during periods of weak market conditions and low rates per day worked 
should the company undertake a large number of drydockings in a particular fiscal year or put through survey a disproportionate number of older and or larger vessels  which typically have higher drydocking costs  comparative results may be affected 
for the years ended december   and  drydocking costs totaled million  million and million  respectively 
during those same periods  the company completed the drydocking of  and marine vessels  respectively 
the number of main propulsion engine overhauls performed in any year particularly affects engine repair expenses  which are also a significant component of the company s vessel maintenance costs 
in recent years  the company has generally removed older lower horsepower main propulsion engine vessels from its fleet and has replaced them with newer higher horsepower main propulsion engine vessels 
this change in fleet mix has particularly occurred with the company s introduction of the new aluminum constructed fast support intervention vessels  in which main propulsion engines may total  horsepower and exceed the horsepower of older crew vessels sold from the fleet by as much as  horsepower 
should the company undertake a greater number of scheduled main propulsion engine overhauls and or have an increase in emergency engine repairs in a fiscal year  comparative results may be affected 
for the years ended december   and  main propulsion engine repair expenses totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the company believes that recent terrorist attacks  the continuing threat of terrorist activity and economic and political uncertainties have resulted in significant increases in the company s cost to insure liabilities to other parties and damage to its vessels and other property 
the combined effect of rising insurance premiums and the assumption by the company of higher deductible limits is presently expected to increase operating expenses in by an amount between million and million 
there is no assurance that in the future the company will be able to maintain its existing coverage or that it will not experience further substantial increases in premiums 
at december   the company had vessels bareboat chartered in pursuant to sale leaseback transactions that have been accounted for as operating leases for financial reporting purposes 
income realized from the sale component of these transactions has been deferred to the extent of the present value of minimum lease payments and is being amortized to income as reductions in rental expense over the applicable lease terms 
charter in expense  net of deferred income amortization  resulting from sale leaseback transactions totaled million in  million in and million in proceeds from vessels sold pursuant to sale leaseback transactions have been deposited into joint depository construction reserve fund accounts with the maritime administration for purposes of acquiring newly constructed vessels and qualifying for temporary deferral of taxable gains realized from the sale of those vessels 
see liquidity and capital resources cash and marketable securities for additional discussion of construction reserve funds 
in early  the company removed utility vessels from service  considering them held for sale assets pursuant to standards that govern accounting for long lived asset disposal 
these vessels range in length from feet to feet  approximate years of age  and had an aggregate carrying value of million 
as of early  of these vessels remain unsold  and due to the passage of time  no longer meet accounting standards that permit their classification as held for sale assets 
although the company will continue to market these vessels for sale  depreciation will resume on their carrying amount  adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the vessels been continuously classified as held and used over the past year 
these retired vessels have been excluded from utilization statistics and fleet counts 
a portion of the company s revenues and expenses  primarily related to its north sea operations  are received or paid in foreign currencies 
for financial statement reporting purposes  these amounts are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates during the relevant period 
other business segment environmental services the company s environmental service segment provides contractual oil spill response and other related training and consulting services 
the company s clients include tank vessel owner operators  refiners and terminal operators  exploration and production facility operators and pipeline operators 
the company charges a retainer fee to its customers for ensuring by contract the availability at predetermined rates of its response services and equipment 
pursuant to retainer agreements entered into with the company  certain vessel owners pay in advance to the company an annual retainer fee based upon the number and size of vessels in each such owner s fleet and in some circumstances pay the company additional fees based upon the level of each vessel owner s voyage activity in the us the company recognizes the greater of revenue earned by voyage activity or the portion of the retainer earned in each accounting period 
certain vessel and facility owners pay a fixed fee or a fee based on volume of petroleum product transported for the company s retainer services and such fee is recognized ratably throughout the year 
the company s retainer agreements with vessel owners generally range from one to three years while retainer arrangements with facility owners are as long as ten years 
spill response revenues and related operating profits are dependent on the magnitude of any one spill response and the number of spill responses within a given fiscal period 
consequently  spill response revenues and operating profits can vary greatly between comparable periods and the revenues from any one period is not indicative of a trend or of anticipated results in future periods 
costs of oil spill response activities relate primarily to payments to sub contractors for labor  equipment and materials and direct charges to the company for equipment and materials 
the company charges consulting fees to customers for customized training programs  its planning of and participation in customer oil spill response drill programs and response exercises and other special projects 
the principal components of the company s operating costs are salaries and related benefits for operating personnel  payments to sub contractors  equipment maintenance and depreciation 
these expenses are primarily a function of regulatory requirements and the level of retainer business 
inland river services the company s inland river business earns operating revenues primarily from voyage affreightments under which customers are charged for a committed space to transport cargo for a specific time from a point of origin to a destination at an established rate per ton 
the company also earns operating revenues while cargo is stored aboard barges and when barges are chartered out to third parties 
barge operating expenses are typically differentiated between those directly related to voyages and all other barge operating costs 
voyage expenses primarily include towing  switching  fleeting and cleaning costs  whereas  non voyage related operating expenses include such costs as repairs  insurance and depreciation 
a majority of the barges owned by the company and certain of those managed for third parties participate in two pooling arrangements 
pursuant to these pooling arrangements  operating revenues and voyage expenses are pooled and the net results are allocated to respective participating barge owners based upon the number of days any one participating owner s barges bear to the total number of days of all barges participating in the pool 
offshore aviation services tex air derives the majority of its operating revenues from service contracts with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies  primarily in the production phase of the oil and gas cycle 
the number and type of helicopters in tex air s fleet  the utilization of that fleet and the rates of hire tex air is able to obtain in the market primarily influence operating revenues 
rates and utilization are a function of demand for and availability of helicopters  which are closely aligned with the level of exploration  development and production in the us gulf of mexico 
the level of exploration  development and production is affected by both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices that  in turn  are related to the demand for petroleum products and the current availability of oil and gas resources 
at december   tex air s fleet consisted of helicopters  of which helicopters were committed for hire under customer contracts 
operating expenses are primarily a function of fleet size and utilization levels 
the majority of tex air s operating expenses consist of wages and related benefits  insurance  repairs and maintenance and equipment leases 
investment in chiles the company consolidated the reporting of financial information of drill rig operator chiles  as a consequence of its majority ownership of chiles  from chiles inception in until the chiles ipo 
on september   chiles completed the chiles ipo 
upon the chiles ipo  the company s ownership interest in chiles was reduced from to  at which point the company ceased consolidating chiles s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and began accounting for its interest in chiles using the equity method 
following the chiles merger in august  the company began accounting for the shares of ensco it acquired in the chiles merger as available for sale securities and now records changes in their market value each period as adjustments to other comprehensive income 
chiles derived its operating revenues primarily from drilling wells for oil and gas operators 
its rig operating expense consisted primarily of crew costs  insurance  inspections  repair and maintenance and other related costs 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of corporate and safety management  administration  marketing  financial and legal expenses 
other activities other activities primarily relate to the company s ownership interest in globe wireless  a handy max bulk carrier joint venture  and strategic software limited  whose principal activity is to develop and sell software to the ship brokerage and shipping industry 
the company  from time to time  may make investments in other related businesses 
critical accounting policies general 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  the company is required to make estimates  judgements and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
the company bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  as discussed in its footnotes to the consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity 
revenue recognition 
operating revenues are earned primarily from the offshore marine service segment s time and bareboat charter out of vessels 
operating revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service has been delivered  fees are fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable and when other significant obligations have been fulfilled 
reserves for doubtful accounts receivable 
the company extends short term credit to its customers who are primarily major and large independent oil and gas exploration companies 
although credit risks are considered minimal  the company regularly reviews amounts owing to the company from customers and adjusts its reserve for probable doubtful accounts receivable 
purchase accounting and goodwill 
purchase accounting requires extensive use of estimates and judgement to allocate the cost of an acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the cost of each acquired operation is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
these estimates are revised during an allocation period as necessary when  and if  information becomes available to further define and quantify the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition 
to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period  the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted 
should information become available after the allocation period  those items are included in operating results 
the cost of an enterprise acquired in a business combination includes the direct cost of the acquisition 
the operating results of entities acquired are included in the company s consolidated statements of income from the completion date of the applicable transaction 
in recording various business combinations  the company has assigned the excess of the cost of its acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed to goodwill  the balance of which totaled million at december  in and prior years  the company amortized goodwill to expense over the expected benefit period  ranging from to years 
effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other changes to prior practices  the new standard requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances occur between annual tests indicating that goodwill for a reporting unit might be impaired based on a fair value concept 
the company ceased amortization of its remaining goodwill balance effective january  the company s goodwill has primarily resulted from the acquisition of environmental and offshore marine businesses 
the company has performed its annual impairment test of goodwill based upon carrying values as of december  and has determined there was no goodwill impairment 
the implied fair values of the applicable reporting units were determined by employing comparable company and present value techniques to estimate the fair value of related groups net assets 
estimates used in discounted cash flow projections were consistent with the most recent budgets and plans used by management and incorporated consideration of industry trends 
there were many assumptions and estimates employed in determining the implied fair value of each reporting unit  including among other  the projection of vessels rates per day worked  vessels utilization  plans for vessel acquisitions and dispositions and operating expenses 
the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  variations from those estimates could produce materially different results 
after tax goodwill amortization for each of the twelve month periods ending december  and was million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
fair value of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and except for those transactions that are effective hedges for accounting purposes in accordance with sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  gains and losses are included in the determination of net income 
the derivative contracts recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheets are stated at their fair values  the determination of which the company acquired from third parties that regularly conduct business in the derivative contracts  which we have negotiated 
future adverse changes in the market price for the underlying notional amounts of the company s derivative contracts may result in losses in the company s statement of income or other comprehensive income  if hedge accounting criteria are met 
investments 
the company holds less than majority investments in  and has receivables from  strategically aligned companies that totaled million at december  the company employs the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock when such investments in voting stock gives it the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of a company even though it holds or less of the voting stock 
significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the company owns between and of an entity s voting stock  although the ability to exercise influence may be indicated in several ways even when such investments are below 
the company also holds a million investment  carried at cost  in a private company over which it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence nor does it own greater than of the entity s voting stock 
the company may record investment impairment charges when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company depreciates its vessels over to years from date of original construction  except for standby safety vessels where it has chosen a useful life of years 
in assigning depreciable lives to its vessels  the company has considered the effects of both physical deterioration largely caused by wear and tear due to operating use and other economic factors that could impact commercial viability 
furthermore  salvage value  an amount typically expected to be recovered through sale upon vessel retirement  approximates of cost 
to date  the company s experience confirms that these policies are reasonable  although  there may be events or changes in circumstances in the future that indicate the recoverability of the carrying amount of a vessel might not be possible 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate that the recoverability of a vessel s carrying amount should be assessed might include i a significant decrease in the market value of a vessel  ii a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a vessel and iii current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with a vessel 
if events or changes in circumstances as set forth above indicate that a vessel s carrying amount may not be recoverable  the company would then be required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the vessel  the company would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
income taxes 
at december   the company had not provided for us income taxes with respect to million of undistributed earnings of certain non us subsidiaries and or less owned companies as it is the company s intention to indefinitely invest these earnings abroad 
should a remittance of these earnings be expected in the foreseeable future  the company would then be required to provision for the related us income tax consequences 
foreign currency transactions 
the company accounts for its foreign operations in accordance with sfas  foreign currency translation 
the company is particularly exposed to the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations in the united kingdom  where certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries operate offshore vessels and whose functional currency  the primary currency in which the wholly owned subsidiaries conduct their business  is pounds sterling 
through these operations  the company is subject to foreign currency translation adjustments  an inherent result of the process of translating foreign entities financial statements from their functional currency to the us dollar  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
seacor has made advances to certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries  whose functional currency is pounds sterling 
seacor considers these advances to be intercompany loans with payment expected in the foreseeable future 
until repaid  accounting standards require that changes in the value of the intercompany loans due to fluctuations in the exchange rate from the transaction date until the settlement date with respect to these intercompany loans be included in the determination of net income 
the company is also exposed to transaction gains and losses that result from the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than in the functional currency of any seacor subsidiary 
if it should be determined that the functional currency of a foreign subsidiary should be changed to us dollars  the accumulated currency translation adjustments that apply to the subsidiary would be retained in accumulated comprehensive income until the subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated 
further  nonmonetary assets owned by the subsidiary at the end of the period immediately prior to the change would be translated in subsequent periods at the exchange rate that was current at the end of that period 
if the subsidiary were sold or substantially liquidated  the cumulative translation adjustment attributable to that subsidiary would then be removed from accumulated other comprehensive income and be included in determining the gain or loss recognized on the sale or liquidation of that investment 
results of operations the following table sets forth the operating revenues and profits of the company s offshore marine service business and combines similar results for its environmental and inland river businesses and for chiles from until the chiles ipo in an other reporting category  as they do not meet accounting standards for separate disclosure 
in prior years  the environmental service business was reported as a separate segment but no longer meets criteria for reporting segregation pursuant to accounting standards

the company considers long lived assets to be property and equipment that has been distributed to geographical areas based upon the assets physical location during the applicable period 
certain of the company s offshore marine service segment s long lived vessel assets relocate from time to time between its geographical areas of operation 
the costs of long lived vessel assets that are relocated have been allocated between geographical areas of operation based upon length of service in the applicable region 
the following table is presented in thousands of dollars for the years ending december revenues united states of america    foreign united kingdom    nigeria    other    long lived assets united states of america    foreign united kingdom    nigeria    other    comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year offshore marine services operating revenues 
the offshore marine service segment s operating revenues decreased million  or  in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  declines in operating revenues resulting primarily from lower utilization  rates per day worked and the bareboat charter out of additional vessels were partially offset by an improvement in operating revenues resulting from changes in fleet composition and the strengthening in of the pound sterling currency against the us dollar 
a decline in fleet utilization lowered operating revenues by approximately million 
utilization declined for all vessel types in the company s us fleet and for anchor handling towing supply and supply and towing supply vessels operating internationally 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in operating revenues resulting from improved utilization of the company s foreign crew vessels 
a decline in rates per day worked lowered operating revenues by approximately million 
rates per day worked decreased for all of the company s us vessel types  excluding anchor handling towing supply whose rates increased slightly between years 
in foreign markets  declining rates per day worked earned by anchor handling towing supply vessels were offset by an improvement in rates per day worked earned by crew and supply and towing supply vessels 
functional currency pounds sterling rates per day worked earned by the company s north sea standby safety vessels remained steady between years  however  a strengthening between years in the pound sterling currency relative to the us dollar increased reported operating revenues by approximately million 
operating revenues also declined by approximately million due to a net increase in the number of vessels entering bareboat charter out service 
an improvement in operating revenues resulting from fleet additions exceeded declines resulting from fleet dispositions by approximately million 
operating revenues earned in the current and prior year by recently acquired north sea anchor handling towing supply and supply vessels and newly constructed crew and mini supply vessels operating principally in the us gulf of mexico exceeded declines resulting from the sale and charter in termination of less marketable us utility and crew vessels  north sea standby safety vessels and other foreign supply and towing supply vessels 
operating profit 
the offshore marine business segment s operating profit decreased million  or  in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  due primarily to those factors affecting operating revenues outlined above and higher operating expenses 
crew wages for seamen increased in both the current and prior year in response to competition for qualified personnel 
regulatory docking expense rose between years as cost to repair additional supply and towing supply and anchor handling towing supply vessels in exceeded declines resulting from the repair of fewer  less expensive  crew and utility vessels 
a greater number of main engine overhauls  higher expenses resulting from major hull repairs to a anchor handling towing supply vessel and the replacement of certain diesel generator engines resulted in higher vessel repair and maintenance expenses between years 
foreign shore support expenses increased due to the company s nigerian office relocation and higher shore support wage costs in that region and expanded trinidadian vessel operations 
fleet repositioning along the west african coast and rising fees resulted in higher port and pilotage expenses 
the sale leaseback of vessels in the current and prior year caused an increase in charter in expense that was partially offset by lower depreciation 
depreciation and amortization expense additionally declined between years as certain of the company s north sea standby safety vessels reached the end of their depreciable lives and the company ceased amortizing goodwill cost effective january  in accordance with recently enacted accounting standards 
income loss from equipment sales or retirements  net 
income from equipment sales or retirements decreased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  the offshore marine service segment sold vessels in income recognized from these sales was generally constant with sale income of the prior year 
results of included a million charge against income from the write down of the carrying value of equipment associated with a cancelled offshore vessel construction contract 
this decline was offset by income recognition of million in from a vessel sale completed in a prior year to a joint venture that was previously deferred based on the company having financed the transaction 
that sale was refinanced with a lending institution and the company s loan was repaid 
prior year results included a million charge against income with respect to the write down in the carrying value of vessels 
thirteen vessels were sold in pursuant to sale leaseback transactions that resulted in the deferral of income recognition of million 
sale income was deferred to the extent of the present value of minimum lease payments and is being amortized to income as reductions in rental expense over the applicable lease terms 
equity in net earnings losses of or less owned companies 
equity earnings increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  profits rose due to improved performance by the pelican joint venture and other joint ventures operating in trinidad  egypt and greece 
foreign currency exchange gains losses 
net foreign currency exchange gains increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december   due primarily to the revaluation of intercompany loans between seacor and certain of its wholly owned offshore marine subsidiaries  whose functional currency is pounds sterling  as that currency strengthened against the us dollar 
other business segment operating revenues 
the other business segments operating revenues declined million  or  in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  operating revenues earned by the environmental service segment decreased million  or  due to the loss of certain customers retainer business  retainer service contract renegotiations with certain other customers and a decrease in the number and severity of managed oil spills 
operating revenues earned by the inland river business segment increased million  or  due to an increase in the size of the company s barge fleet 
operating revenues in included a million arrangement fee earned for provisioning services in obtaining rig construction financing for chiles 
operating profit 
the other business segments operating profit increased million  or  in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  the operating profits of the inland river business increased million  or  and other operating profit in totaled million  resulting from the arrangement fee collected from chiles 
these increases in operating profits were offset primarily by a million  or  decline in the operating profits earned by the company s environmental service segment 
reduced operating revenues of the environmental service segment were partially offset by lower direct cost of spill response and vessel and field operating expenses 
results of the environmental service segment also benefited from lower expense due to the cessation of goodwill amortization effective january  in accordance with recently enacted accounting standards 
equity in net earnings losses of or less owned companies 
the other business segments incurred equity losses of million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to recognizing equity earnings of million in the twelve month period ended december  earnings were reduced as a result of the chiles merger and a charge against income for investment impairment in strategic software limited 
results in included a gain realized from the sale of a handymax dry bulk ship by a bulk carrier joint venture 
these declines were offset by lower operating losses of globe wireless 
other net interest expense

a retainer client of a dissolved us west coast joint venture was added in late and international equipment sales increased between years 
operating profit 
the other business segments operating profit decreased million  or  in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  due primarily to those factors affecting operating revenues outlined above and higher environmental service segment operating expenses

liquidity and capital resources cash and marketable securities at december   the company s cash and investments in marketable securities totaled million  including million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in marketable securities and million of construction reserve funds 
the company s cash and investments in marketable securities increased million in the twelve month period ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  see cash generation and deployment below 
construction reserve funds at december  were comprised of joint depository accounts with the maritime administration that were established pursuant to section of the merchant marine act   as amended 
in accordance with this statute  the company has been permitted to deposit proceeds from the sale of certain vessels into the joint depository construction reserve fund accounts for purposes of acquiring newly constructed us flag vessels and qualifying for temporary deferral of taxable gains realized from the sale of the vessels 
from date of deposit  withdrawals from the joint depository construction reserve fund accounts are subject to prior written approval of the maritime administration  and the funds on deposit must be committed for expenditure within three years or be released for the company s general use 
any such gains from vessel sales previously deferred would become immediately taxable upon release to the company of sale proceeds that were deposited into joint depository construction reserve fund accounts

cash generation and deployment the company s ongoing liquidity requirements arise primarily from its need to service debt  fund working capital  acquire  construct or improve equipment and make other investments 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility although  from time to time  it may issue shares of common stock  preferred stock  debt or a combination thereof  or sell vessels to finance the acquisition of equipment and businesses or make improvements to existing equipment 
the company s cash flow levels are determined by the size of the company s offshore marine fleet  rates per day worked and overall utilization of the company s offshore marine vessels and the operations of its environmental service  inland river and offshore aviation business segments 
the volatility of oil and gas prices  the level of offshore production and exploration activity and other factors beyond the company s control will directly affect the company s offshore marine and aviation service businesses 
a curtailment of drilling activity in us gulf of mexico following march has adversely affected demand and rates per day worked for most vessel types in the company s domestic offshore marine fleet 
as a result  operating results have declined  and at december   the company has us vessels out of service that include  amongst others  utility and crew vessels 
although oil and natural gas prices have improved  this has yet to produce an increase in us gulf of mexico drilling activity 
the company cannot predict whether  or to what extent  market conditions will improve  remain stable or even deteriorate 
as a result  should present demand and rates per day worked for the company s us vessels remain unchanged or further decline  results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected 
cash flows provided from operating activities

globe wireless since its inception in the early s  globe wireless has focused on expanding its network of high frequency radio stations and customers base 
to support its continued growth  globe wireless completed a private placement offering in that raised approximately million 
although globe wireless has experienced negative cash flow  the management of globe wireless presently believes it will closely approximate operating cash break even by mid there can be no assurances that globe wireless future operations will succeed 
should globe wireless be unable to meet its funding requirements  seacor would be required to commit additional funding or record an impairment charge with respect to its investment 
at december   the carrying value of the company s investment in globe wireless was million

effects of inflation the company s operations expose it to the effects of inflation 
although the company does not consider the effects of inflation to be material to its operating revenues or income from continuing operations  in the event that inflation becomes a significant factor in the world economy  inflationary pressures could result in increased operating and financing costs 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this new statement also supercedes certain aspects of accounting principle board opinion no 
apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported in discontinued operations in the period incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required by apb additionally  certain dispositions may now qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires recording the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period incurred 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application permitted 
upon adoption of the standard  the company will be required to use a cumulative effect approach to recognize transition amounts for any existing retirement obligation liabilities  asset retirement costs and accumulated depreciation 
the nature of the company s business and long lived assets is such that adoption of this new standard should have no significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  recission of fasb statements nos 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  this statement  among other matters  provides guidance with respect to the accounting for gains or losses on capital leases which were modified to become operating leases 
the statement also eliminates the requirement that gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items and provides guidance when gains or losses on the early retirement of debt should or should not be reflected as an extraordinary item 
the adoption of this statement effective january  will result in the reclassification of the extraordinary losses recognized in and to income from continuing operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that costs associated with terminating employees or contracts or closing or relocating facilities are to be recognized at fair value at the time the liability is incurred 
the company does not expect adoption of this statement when it becomes effective for disposal activities initiated after december  to have a material effect on its financial statements 
cautionary statements in addition to the other information contained in this annual report  the following factors should be considered carefully 
the offshore marine service segment and offshore aviation segment of the company are subject to cyclicality and a significant or prolonged decline in oil and gas prices would likely reduce the level of exploration and development of offshore areas  which would reduce demand for the company s vessels and helicopters 
the offshore oil and gas industry is highly cyclical 
activity in the offshore oil and gas exploration and production industry has a significant impact on the company s offshore marine operations 
the level of exploration and development of offshore areas is affected by both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices 
in recent years  oil and gas prices have been extremely volatile and  as a result  the level of offshore exploration and drilling activity also has been extremely volatile 
reductions in oil and gas prices generally result in decreased drilling and production and corresponding decreases in demand for the company s vessels  logistics services and helicopters 
decreased demand for these services would reduce the company s revenues and profitability 
the company relies on several customers for a significant share of its revenues  the loss of which could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
the company s customers are primarily the major oil companies  large independent oil and gas exploration and production companies  members of the maritime community and owners of refineries  pipelines and tank terminals 
the portion of the company s revenues attributable to any single customer changes over time  depending on the level of relevant activity by the customer  the company s ability to meet the customer s needs and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the company may incur significant costs  liabilities and penalties in complying with government regulations 
government regulation  such as international conventions  federal  state and local laws and regulations in jurisdictions where the company s vessels operate or are registered  have a significant impact on the company s offshore marine and other business segments 
these regulations relate to worker health and safety  the manning  construction and operation of vessels  oil spills and other aspects of the company s business 
risks of incurring substantial compliance costs and liabilities and penalties for non compliance  particularly with respect to environmental laws and regulations  are inherent in the company s business 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a substantial negative impact on the company s profitability and financial position 
the company cannot predict whether it will incur such costs or penalties in the future 
the company faces intense competition that could adversely affect its ability to increase its market share and revenues 
the company s businesses operate in highly competitive industries 
high levels of competition could reduce its operating revenues  increase its expenses and reduce its profitability 
in addition to price  service and reputation  important competitive factors for offshore fleets of vessels include customers national flag preference  operating conditions and intended use all of which determine the suitability of available vessels  complexity of logistical support needs and presence of equipment in the appropriate geographical locations 
the primary competitive factors in the environmental service business are price  service  reputation  experience and operating capabilities 
in addition  the company believes that the absence of uniform environmental regulation and enforcement on international  federal  state and local levels has lowered barriers to entry in several market segments and increased the number of competitors 
the company s environmental service business faces competition from marine spill response corporation a non profit corporation funded by the major integrated oil companies  other industry cooperatives and smaller contractors who target specific market niches 
the inland business is highly competitive and there are few significant barriers to entry 
certain of the company s principal competitors have greater financial resources and or are less leveraged than the company and may be better able to withstand and respond to adverse market conditions within the barging industry 
there can be no assurance that such competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations or that the company will not encounter increased competition in the future  which also could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
an increase in supply of offshore support vessels would likely have a negative effect on the charter rates earned by the company s offshore support vessels  which would reduce the company s earnings 
expansion of the worldwide offshore support vessel fleet would increase competition in the markets where the company operates 
the refurbishment of disused or mothballed vessels  conversion of vessels from uses other than oil support and related activities or construction of new vessels could all add vessel capacity to current worldwide levels 
a significant increase in vessel capacity would lower charter rates and result in a corresponding reduction in revenues and profitability 
vessel and helicopter related risks could disrupt the company s offshore marine and helicopter services and expose the company to liability 
the operation of offshore support vessels and helicopters is subject to various risks  including catastrophic disaster  adverse weather  mechanical failure  collision  and risks with respect to vessels additionally include sea conditions  capsizing  grounding  oil and hazardous substance spills and navigation errors 
these risks could endanger the safety of the company s personnel  equipment  cargo and other property  as well as the environment 
if any of these events were to occur  the company could be held liable for resulting damages 
in addition  the affected vessels or helicopters could be removed from service and would not be available to generate revenues 
the company s offshore aviation business may be subject to adverse weather conditions and seasonality 
three types of weather related and seasonal occurrences impact the company s offshore aviation business segment  poor weather conditions generally  tropical storm season in the us gulf of mexico  and the number of hours of daylight 
poor visibility  high winds  and heavy precipitation can affect the operation of helicopters and result in reduced number of flight hours 
in the us gulf of mexico  the months of december through february have more days of adverse weather conditions than the other months of the year and june through november is tropical storm season 
during tropical storms  the company is unable to operate in the area of the storm although flight activity may increase due to the evacuation of offshore workers 
in addition  the company s facilities are located along the us gulf of mexico coast and tropical storms may cause damage to its property 
the fall and winter months have fewer hours of daylight 
consequently  flight hours are generally lower at these times 
a significant portion of the company s revenues from its offshore aviation business segment is dependent on actual flight hours and prolonged periods of adverse weather and the effect of fewer hours of daylight can adversely affect operating revenues and operating profits of the company s offshore aviation business segment 
the company s insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect the company from the liabilities that could arise in its businesses 
the company maintains insurance coverage against the risks related to its businesses 
there can be no assurance  however  that its existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims 
if a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured  the company could be exposed to substantial liability 
the company s significant global operations are subject to currency exchange risks 
to minimize the financial impact of currency fluctuations and risks arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the company attempts to contract the majority of its services in us dollars 
however  in some of its foreign businesses  the company collects revenues and pays expenses in local currency 
if the value of foreign currencies decline against the us dollar  the company s operating revenues would effectively be reduced 
the company engages in certain currency hedging arrangements designed to minimize the effect of fluctuation in pounds sterling  the currency in the united kingdom  where most of its currency exchange risk arises 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not incur losses in the future as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
because a significant proportion of the company s offshore marine operations are conducted in foreign countries  unstable political  military and economic conditions in those countries could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
during  approximately of the company s offshore marine revenues were derived from foreign operations 
these operations are subject to risks  among other things  of political instability  potential vessel seizure  terrorist attacks  nationalization of assets  currency restrictions  import export quotas and other forms of public and governmental regulation  all of which are beyond the company s control 
economic sanctions or an oil embargo  for example  could have a significant negative impact on activity in the oil and gas industry and correspondingly on the company should it operate vessels in the region of the embargo 
in addition  the company s vessel operations in mexico are significantly affected by mexican government policy 
the company cannot predict whether any such conditions or events might develop in the future 
the company may be unable to maintain or replace its vessels as they age 
as of december   the average age of vessels the company owned  excluding its standby safety vessels  was approximately years 
the company believes that after an offshore support vessel has been in service for approximately years  the expense which typically increases with age necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels  or that its financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make expenditures necessary for these purposes or to acquire or build replacement vessels 
spill response revenue is dependent upon the magnitude and number of spill responses 
the company s environmental service business spill response revenue can vary greatly between comparable fiscal periods based on the number and magnitude of spill responses in any given period 
as a result  the company s revenue and profitability attributable to this business may vary greatly from period to period 
a relaxation of oil spill regulation or enforcement could reduce demand for the company s environmental service 
the company s environmental service business is dependent upon the enforcement of regulations promulgated under opa and  to a lesser extent  upon state regulations 
less stringent oil spill regulations or less aggressive enforcement of these regulations would decrease demand for the company s environmental service segment s services 
there can be no assurance that oil spill regulation will not be relaxed or enforcement of existing or future regulation will not become less stringent 
if this happens  the demand for the company s oil spill response services could be reduced  which could have a negative impact on its profitability 
a change in  or revocation of  nrc s classification as an oil spill removal organization would result in a loss of business 
nrc is classified as an osro 
osro classification is a voluntary process conducted by the coast guard 
the coast guard classifies osros based on their overall ability to respond to various types and sizes of oil spills in different operating environments  such as rivers canals  inland waters and oceans 
coast guard classified osros have a competitive advantage over non classified service providers 
customers of a classified osro are exempt from regulations that would otherwise require them to list their oil spill response resources in filings with the coast guard 
a loss of nrc s classification or changes in the requirements could eliminate or diminish nrc s ability to provide customers with this exemption 
if this happens  the company could lose customers  in which case its revenues and profitability would decline 
the company s environmental service business may incur liability in connection with providing spill response services 
although the company s environmental service business is generally exempt from liability under the federal clean water act for its own actions and omissions in providing spill response services  this exemption would not apply if it was found to have been grossly negligent or to have engaged in willful misconduct  or if it fails to provide these services consistent with applicable regulations and directives under the clean water act 
in addition  the exemption under the federal clean water act would not protect the company s environmental service business against liability for personal injury or wrongful death  or against prosecution under other federal or state laws 
while most of the us states in which the company s environmental service business provides service have adopted similar exemptions  several states have not 
if a court or other applicable authority determines that the company s environmental service business does not benefit from federal or state exemptions from liability in providing spill response services  the company s environmental service business could be liable together with the local contractor and the responsible party for any resulting damages  including damages caused by others 
if the company does not restrict the amount of foreign ownership of its common stock  the company could be prohibited from operating its vessels in parts of the us  which would adversely affect its business and operating results 
the company is subject to the shipping act and the act 
these acts govern  among other things  the ownership and operation of vessels used to carry cargo between us ports 
the acts require that vessels engaged in the us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens and built in the united states 
for a corporation engaged in the us coastwise trade to be deemed a citizen of the us i the corporation must be organized under the laws of the us or of a state  territory or possession thereof  ii each of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board of directors must be a us citizen and no officer who is not a us citizen may act in such person s absence  iii no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business can be non us citizens and iv at least of the interest in such corporation must be owned by us citizens as defined in the acts 
the company would be prohibited from operating its vessels in the us coastwise trade during any period in which the company did not comply with these regulations 
to facilitate compliance with the acts  the company s restated certificate of incorporation i limits the aggregate percentage ownership by non us citizens of any class of the company s capital stock including the common stock to of the outstanding shares of each such class to ensure that such foreign ownership will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by applicable maritime law presently and authorizes the board of directors  under certain circumstances  to increase the foregoing percentage to  ii requires institution of a dual stock certification system to help determine such ownership and iii permits the board of directors to make such determinations as reasonably may be necessary to ascertain such ownership and implement such limitations 
in addition  the company s amended and restated by laws provide that the number of foreign directors shall not exceed a minority of the number necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and restrict any officer who is not a us citizen from acting in the absence or disability of the chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer and the president  all of whom must be us citizens 
the inland river barges may experience significant variability in freight rates 
freight transportation rates may fluctuate from season to season and year to year 
the level of dry cargoes requiring transportation on the inland waterways will vary due to numerous factors  including global economic conditions and business cycles  domestic agricultural production demand as well as international agricultural production demand and the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
in addition  the number of barges in the overall industry fleet available to transport these cargoes will vary from year to year as older barges are retired and scrapped and new barges are constructed and placed into service 
the resulting relationship between available cargoes and available barges will vary with periods of low barge availability and high cargo demand causing higher freight rates and periods of high barge availability and low cargo demand causing lower freight rates 
significant periods of high barge availability and low cargo demand could have an adverse affect on the company s inland river business 
inland river operations are exposed to the level of grain exports 
the company s inland river business is significantly affected by the level of grain export volume handled through us gulf of mexico ports 
grain exports can vary due to  among other things  crop harvest yield levels in the united states and abroad 
overseas grain shortages can increase demand for us grain  while worldwide over production can decrease the demand for us grain 
this variable nature of grain exports can result in temporary barge oversupply  which can drive down freight rates 
there can be no assurance that historical levels of grain export volume will be maintained in the future and  to the extent supply imbalances were to prevail for a significant period of time  they could have an adverse affect on the company s inland river business 
inland river operations are exposed to international economic and political factors 
the company s inland river operations may be affected by actions of foreign governments and global or regional economic developments 
for example  global economic events such as foreign import export policy or currency fluctuations  could affect the level of imports and exports 
foreign agricultural subsidies can also impact demand for us agricultural exports 
in addition  foreign trade agreements and each country s adherence to the terms of such agreements can raise or lower demand for us imports and exports 
national and international boycotts and embargoes of other countries or us imports and or exports together with the raising or lowering of tariff rates will affect the level of cargoes requiring transportation on the inland waterways 
changes in the value of the u 
s 
dollar relative to other currencies will raise or lower demand for us exports as well as us demand for foreign produced raw materials and finished good imports 
such actions or developments could have an adverse affect on the company s inland river business 
inland river operations are exposed to seasonality in activity 
the company s inland river business is seasonal  and its quarterly operating revenues and operating profits historically have been lower during the first and second fiscal quarters of the year january through june and higher during the third and fourth fiscal quarters july through december due to the grain harvest 
inland river operations are exposed to risks of adverse weather and river conditions 
the company s barging operations are affected by weather and river conditions 
varying weather patterns can affect river levels and cause ice in northern united states river areas 
for example  the upper mississippi river closes annually from approximately mid december to mid march and ice conditions can hamper navigation on the upper reaches of the illinois river during the winter months 
in addition  adverse river conditions affect towboat speed  tow size and loading drafts and can delay barge movements 
lock outages due to lock maintenance and or other interruptions in normal lock operation can also delay barge movements 
it is likely that the company s inland river operations will be subject to adverse weather or river conditions in the future and there can be no assurance that such weather or river conditions will not adversely affect its revenues and profitability 
inland river operations are exposed to fuel price fluctuations 
fuel prices are subject to fluctuation as a result of domestic and international events 
while the company does not currently own towboats or fleeting operations  but rather purchases these services from third party vendors  it is indirectly exposed to increases in fuel prices in that the vendors will adjust the price of the services when fuel prices escalate 
thus  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience pressure from increased fuel prices in the future  which could adversely affect the operating expenses and operating profits of its inland river business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has foreign currency exchange risks primarily related to its vessel operations that are conducted from ports located in the united kingdom where its functional currency is pounds sterling 
the financial statements of the company s united kingdom operations are measured using the pound sterling 
changes in the strength of that currency relative to the us dollar and the corresponding adjustment to the net assets of those operations caused by exchange rate fluctuations result in the recognition of currency translation adjustments that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
pound million of total net assets before translation to us dollars are reported in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  a weakening in the exchange rate of the pound sterling against the us dollar would result in an after tax charge of million to other comprehensive income related to these investments 
to protect the us dollar value of pound sterling denominated net assets of the company from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to their conversion to us dollars  the company has entered into forward exchange contracts 
the forward exchange contracts enable the company to sell pounds sterling for us dollars in the future at fixed exchange rates to offset the consequences of changes in foreign exchange on the amount of us dollar cash flows to be derived from the net assets 
the company considers these forward exchange contracts as economic hedges of a net investment because the translation adjustments resulting from the forward exchange contracts move in the opposite direction from the translation adjustments resulting from the restatement of its united kingdom subsidiaries net assets 
at december   there were no outstanding forward exchange contracts for which hedge accounting criteria were met 
the company has also entered into forward exchange and futures contracts that are considered speculative with respect to norwegian kroners  pounds sterling  euros and singapore dollars 
the norwegian kroner contracts enabled the company to buy norwegian kroners in the future at fixed exchange rates  which could have offset possible consequences of changes in foreign exchange had the company conducted business in norway 
the pound sterling  euro and singapore dollar contracts enable the company to buy pounds sterling  euros and singapore dollars in the future at fixed exchange rates  which could offset possible consequences of changes in foreign exchange of the company s business conducted in the united kingdom  the netherlands  france and singapore 
at december   the company had no material outstanding forward exchange and futures contracts 
the company has entered into and settled various positions in natural gas and crude oil via swaps  options and futures contracts pursuant to which  on each applicable settlement date  the company receives or pays an amount  if any  by which a contract price for a swap  an option or a futures contract exceeds the settlement price quoted on the new york mercantile exchange nymex or receives or pays the amount  if any  by which the settlement price quoted on the nymex exceeds the contract price 
the general purpose of these hedge transactions is to provide value to the company should the price of natural gas and crude oil decline  which over time  if sustained  would lead to a decline in the company s offshore assets market values and cash flows 
at december   the fair market value of the company s positions in commodity contracts was not material 
the company  furthermore  beginning in the fourth quarter of  entered into and settled various positions in us treasury notes and bonds via futures or options on futures and rate lock agreements on us treasury notes pursuant to which  on each applicable settlement date  the company receives or pays an amount  if any  by which a contract price for an option or a futures contract exceeds the settlement price quoted on the chicago board of trade cbot or receives or pays the amount  if any  by which the settlement price quoted on the cbot exceeds the contract price 
the general purpose of these hedge transactions is to provide value to the company should the price of us treasury notes and bonds decline  leading to generally higher interest rates which  if sustained over time  might lead to higher interest costs for the company 
for accounting purposes  the company records the change in the market value of its us treasury positions at the end of each month and recognizes a related gain or loss 
at december   the company had no outstanding contracts with respect to us treasury obligations 
seacor provides cash advances to wholly owned subsidiaries  whose functional currency is pounds sterling 
at december   the outstanding amount of these advances totaled million  or pound million 
seacor considers these advances to be intercompany loans with payment expected in the foreseeable future 
until repaid  accounting standards require that changes in the exchange rate from the transaction date until the settlement date with respect to these intercompany loans be included in the determination of net income 
a loan repayment in reduced the outstanding balance of the intercompany loans to approximately million  or pound million 
a weakening in the exchange rate of the pound sterling currency against the us dollar with respect to the loans presently outstanding would result in the company s recognition of an approximate million pre tax foreign currency transaction loss 
at december   the company held fixed income investments having a fair value of million 
these fixed income investments included us government bonds  uk government bonds  state and municipal bonds  and corporate notes 
these investments had terms ranging from six months to years 
the fair value of these investments will fluctuate based on the general level of interest rates and the creditworthiness of the issuers of the investments 
a increase in the level of interest rates would cause the fair value of these investments  and hence comprehensive income  to decrease by million 
the fair value of corporate notes  which bear a greater risk of default  was million 
the company manages its risk associated with these investments by maintaining a ladder of maturities and analyzing the creditworthiness of issuers 
in addition to fixed income investments  the company held equity securities with a fair value of million as of december   the majority of which was shares of ensco received in connection with the chiles merger of which  shares were subject to a costless collar as more fully described below 
a decline in the value of these securities would reduce other comprehensive income by million 
the company monitors these investments on a regular basis and disposes of investments when it judges the risk profile to be too high or when it believes that the investments have reached an attractive valuation 
the company s debt is primarily in fixed interest rate instruments 
while the fair value of these debt instruments will vary with changes in interest rates  the company has fixed most of its cash flow requirements and operations are not significantly affected by interest rate fluctuations 
the company s only significant variable rate debt instrument is its revolving credit facility  under which the company had no outstanding borrowings at december  while available for liquidity requirements  the company has not historically utilized significant portions of the revolving credit facility for any extended period of time and thus has not been significantly impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
in order to reduce its cost of capital  the company entered into swap agreements during the fourth quarter of and second quarter of with a major financial institution with respect to million of its notes 
pursuant to each such agreement  such financial institution agreed to pay to the company an amount equal to interest paid on the notional amount of the notes subject to such agreement  and the company agreed to pay to such financial institution an amount equal to interest currently at the rate of approximately per annum on the agreed upon price of such notional amount of the notes as set forth in the applicable swap agreement 
upon termination of each swap agreement  the financial institution agreed to pay to the company the amount  if any  by which the fair market value of the notional amount of the notes subject to such swap agreements on such date exceeded the agreed upon price of such notional amount as set forth in such swap agreements  and the company agreed to pay to such financial institution the amount  if any  by which the agreed upon price of such notional amount exceeded the fair market value of such notional amount on such date 
the agreed upon price of such notional amount as set forth in such swap agreements totaled  million 
at december   million notional principal amount of the notes were covered by such swap agreements 
during the fourth quarter of  the swap agreements were extended for an additional twelve months and will now terminate during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of unless they are extended further by mutual consent 
at december   the unrealized pre tax gains that resulted from the fair value of the notional amounts exceeding the agreed upon price set forth in the swap agreements totaled million 
in order to partially hedge the fluctuation in market value for part of the company s common stock position in ensco that resulted from the chiles merger  the company entered into various transactions commonly known as costless collars during with a major financial institution on  shares of ensco common stock 
the effect of these transactions is that the company will be guaranteed a minimum value of approximately and a maximum value of approximately per share of ensco  at expiration 
the costless collars will expire during the second quarter if the share value of ensco s common stock is in excess of approximately at expiration  then the company will have a choice of either a selling the shares to the counterparty for or b paying the counterparty the difference between the market value and  in cash  and continue to own the shares 
if  on the other hand  the share value of ensco s common stock is less than approximately at expiration  then the company will have a choice of either a selling the shares to the counterparty for or b receiving the difference between the market value and  in cash  and continue to own the shares 
if the share value of ensco s common stock is between and at expiration  then neither party will have a payment obligation and the company will continue to own the shares 
the company establishes the fair value of the costless collar at the end of each reporting period and the change in value is reported in the financial statements as derivative income or loss  net 
in  pre tax unrealized losses totaled million with respect to these costless collars
