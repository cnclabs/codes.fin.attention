item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
the following analysis contains forward looking statements about our future revenues  operating results and expectations 
see forward looking statements and associated risks for a discussion of the risks  assumptions and uncertainties affecting these statements as well as risk factors 
general effective february   we reorganized our operations  resulting in a change in our operating segments 
prior to february   we reported in three segments environmental infrastructure  integrated epc services and manufacturing and distribution 
effective february   we segregated our business activities into three operating segments engineering  construction maintenance ecm segment  environmental and infrastructure e i segment  and fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment 
the primary change from our previously reported segments is that pipe fabrication and related operations were moved from the segment previously reported as the integrated epc services segment to the segment previously reported as the manufacturing and distribution segment  resulting in the new ecm segment and the new fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment  respectively 
engineering  construction maintenance the ecm segment provides a range of project related services  including design  engineering  construction  procurement  maintenance  technology and consulting services  primarily to the power generation and process industries 
environmental infrastructure the e i segment provides services which include the identification of contaminants in soil  air and water and the subsequent design and execution of remedial solutions 
this segment also provides project and facilities management capabilities and other related services to non environmental civil construction  watershed restoration and outsourcing privatization markets 
fabrication  manufacturing and distribution the fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment provides integrated piping systems and services for new construction  site expansion and retrofit projects for industrial plants 
we also manufacture and distribute specialty stainless  alloy and carbon steel pipe fittings 
comments regarding future operations historically  we have used acquisitions to pursue market opportunities and to augment or increase existing capabilities and plan to continue to do so 
however  all comments concerning our expectations for future revenue and operating results are based on our forecasts for our existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions 
critical accounting policies and related estimates that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  financial condition  and results of operations and which require complex management judgments and estimates  or involve uncertainties 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to our financial statements 
engineering  procurement and construction contract and environmental and infrastructure revenue recognition and profit and loss estimates a substantial portion of our revenue from both the ecm and e i segments is derived from engineering  procurement and construction contracts 
the contracts may be performed as stand alone engineering  procurement or construction contacts or as combined contracts ie one contract that covers engineering  procurement and construction or a combination thereof 
we use accounting principles set forth in american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and other applicable accounting standards to account for our long term contracts 
we recognize revenue for these contracts on the percentage of completion method  usually based on costs incurred to date  compared with total estimated contract costs 
revenues from reimbursable or cost plus contracts are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned 
profit incentives are included in revenues when their realization is reasonably assured 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which the losses are identified 
the cumulative effect of other changes to estimated contract profit and loss  including those arising from contract penalty provisions such as liquidated damages  final contract settlements  warranty claims and reviews performed by customers  are recognized in the period in which the revisions are identified 
to the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits  we would report such a change by recognizing a charge against current earnings  which might be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
the costs attributable to change orders and claims being negotiated or disputed with customers or subject to litigation are included in total estimated revenue when it is probable they will result in additional contract revenue and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
profit from such change orders and claims is recorded in the period such negotiations are finalized or disputes resolved 
it is possible that there will be future and currently unknown significant adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and gross margins for contracts currently in process  particularly in the later stages of the contracts 
these adjustments are common in the construction industry and inherent in the nature of our contracts 
these adjustments could  depending on the magnitude of the adjustments and or the number of contracts being completed  materially  positively or negatively  affect our operating results in an annual or quarterly reporting period 
these adjustments are  in our opinion  most likely to occur as a result of  or be affected by  the following factors in the application of the percentage of completion accounting method discussed above for our contracts 
a 
revenues and gross margins from cost reimbursable  long term contracts can be significantly affected by contract incentives penalties that may not be known or recorded until the later stages of the contracts 
substantially all of our revenues from cost reimbursable contracts are based on costs incurred plus the fee earned 
applying our revenue recognition practices to these types of contracts usually results in revenues being recognized ratably with a consistent gross margin during most of the contract term 
our cost reimbursable contracts are sometimes structured as target price contracts 
target price contracts contain an incentive penalty arrangement which results in our fee being adjusted  within certain limits  for cost underruns overruns to an established target price  representing our estimated cost and fee for the project 
cost plus contracts provide for reimbursement of all of our costs  but generally limit our fee to a fixed percentage of costs or to a certain specified amount 
usually  target price contracts are priced with higher fees than cost plus contracts because of the uncertainties relating to an adjustable fee arrangement 
additionally  both the target cost and cost plus contracts frequently have other incentive and penalty provisions for such matters as schedule  liquidated damages and testing or performance results 
generally  the penalty provisions for our cost reimbursable contracts are capped to limit our monetary exposure to a portion of the contract gross margin 
although we believe it is unlikely that we could incur losses or lose all of our gross margin on our cost reimbursable contracts  it is possible for penalties to reduce or eliminate previously recorded profits 
the incentive penalty provisions are usually finalized as contract change orders either subsequent to negotiation with  or verification by  our customers 
in most situations  the amount and impact of incentives penalties are not  or cannot be  determined until the completion stages of the contract  at which time we will record the adjustment amounts on a cumulative  catch up basis 
b 
the accuracy of gross margins from fixed price contracts is dependent on the accuracy of cost estimates and other factors 
we have a number of fixed price contracts  most of which were entered into on a negotiated basis 
we also have fixed price contracts that were awarded based on competitive bids 
the accuracy of the gross margins we report for fixed price contracts is dependent upon the judgments we make with respect to our contract performance  our cost estimates  and our ability to recover additional contract costs through change orders  claims or backcharges to subcontractors and vendors 
many of these contracts also have incentive penalty provisions 
increases in cost estimates  unless recoverable from claims  will result in a reduction in margin equivalent to the cost increase multiplied by the percent complete of the project 
c 
revenues and gross margin on contracts can be significantly affected by claims against customers  vendors and others that may not be negotiated until the later stages of a contract or subsequent to the date a contract is completed 
claims include amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that we seek to collect from our customers for delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other causes of unanticipated additional costs 
these claims from customers are included in our revenue estimates as additional contract revenue to the extent that contract costs have been incurred when the recovery of such amounts is probable 
backcharges and claims from vendors  subcontractors and others are included in our cost estimates as a reduction in total estimated costs when recovery of the amounts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
we refer to these claims from customers and backcharges and claims from vendors  subcontractors and others as claims 
as a result  the recording of claims increases gross margin or reduces gross loss on the related projects in the period the claims are recorded 
when calculating the amount of total gross margin or loss on a contract  we include claims from our customers as revenue and claims from vendors  subcontractors and others as reductions in cost of revenues when the collection is deemed probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
including claims in this calculation increases the gross margin or reduces the loss that would otherwise be recorded without consideration of the claims 
claims are recorded to the extent of costs incurred and include no profit element 
in substantially all cases  the claims included in determining contract gross margin are different from the actual claim that will be or has been presented 
when recording the revenue and the associated receivable for claims  we accrue an amount equal to the costs incurred related to claims 
claims receivable are included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on the balance sheet 
claims also include expected relief from liquidated damages  which are excluded from recorded costs 
a summary of claims activity related to our major projects for the years ended august  and is presented in the table below in thousands 
the claims at august  summarized in the table relate to four contracts  most of which are complete or substantially complete 
we are actively engaged in claims negotiation with these customers or have commenced legal proceedings 
the largest claims relate to the wolf hollow  covert and harquahala contracts  which projects were approximately  and complete  respectively  at august  the amounts include claims from customers  subcontractors  and vendors as well as relief from liquidated damages 
the table excludes amounts related to one project for which we believe our exposure to liquidated damages is fully reserved at august  based on preliminary settlement discussions 
of the august  balance  million is included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and million relates to relief of liquidated damages excluded from recorded costs 
beginning balance   additions   costs incurred approved claims write offs ending balance   see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
other revenue recognition and profit and loss estimates the revenue recognition policies related to our fabrication contracts  consulting services  and pipe fittings and manufacturing operations are described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 
because of the nature of the contracts and related work  estimates and judgments usually do not play as important a role in the determination of revenue and profit and loss for these services as they do for the engineering  procurement and construction contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses that could result from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments 
we record  generally as a reduction to income  additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts based on management s assessment of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  and the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts for the specific customer reduces the recognized receivable to the net amount we believe will be ultimately collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  further additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts  which would reduce our earnings  may be required 
these increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts could be significant  depending upon i the size of certain of our epc contracts and ii the potential for us to perform a substantial amount of unreimbursed work on significant projects prior to customers notifying us of their intent not to pay the amounts due see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets liabilities are established for the difference between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we also consider the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment of such changes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
as of august   we had gross deferred tax assets of million including million related to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
as of august   we had a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million 
acquisitions fair value accounting and goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
our goodwill balance as of august  was approximately million  most of which related to the stone webster and it group acquisitions see note and note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
deals with  among other matters  the accounting for goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but that impairment of goodwill assets must be reviewed on a regular basis based on a fair value concept 
sfas no 
prohibits amortization of goodwill  thereby removing certain differences between book and tax expense  which has resulted in a reduction of our effective tax rate 
if sfas no 
had been in effect during fiscal  we estimate that our diluted earnings per share would have been increased by approximately per share for the year ended august  this increase in diluted earnings per share would have resulted from the cessation of goodwill amortization and a lower effective tax rate see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we have completed our annual impairment test as of march  in accordance with sfas no 
and have determined that our goodwill is not impaired 
however  our businesses are cyclical and subject to competitive pressures 
therefore  it is possible that the goodwill values of our businesses could be adversely impacted in the future by these or other factors and that a significant impairment adjustment  which would reduce earnings and affect various debt covenants  could be required in such circumstances 
our next required annual impairment test will be conducted as of march  additionally  our estimates of the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities we acquire in acquisitions are determined by reference to various internal and external data and judgments  including the use of third party experts 
these estimates can and do differ from the basis or value generally representing the acquired entity s actual or amortized cost previously recorded by the acquired entity for its assets and liabilities 
accordingly  our post acquisition financial statements are materially impacted by and dependent on the accuracy of management s fair value estimates and adjustments 
our experience has been that the most significant of these estimates are the values assigned to construction contracts  production backlog  customer relationships  licenses and technology 
these estimates can also have a positive or negative material effect on future reported operating results 
further  our future operating results may also be positively or negatively materially impacted if the final values for the assets acquired or liabilities assumed in our acquisitions are materially different from the fair value estimates which we recorded for the acquisition 
earnings per share and potential equity effect of convertible debt lyons effective may   we issued and sold million of year  zero coupon  unsecured  convertible debt  liquid yield option tm notes  or lyons 
the lyons were issued at an original discount price of per  maturity value and have a yield to maturity of 
we realized net proceeds after expenses from the issuance of the lyons of approximately million 
the lyons are our senior unsecured obligation and are convertible into our common stock at a fixed ratio of shares per  maturity value subject to anti dilution adjustments resulting in an effective conversion price at the date of issuance of per share of common stock issuable upon conversion of the lyons see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the conversion feature described above  the holders of the lyons have the right to require us to repurchase the lyons on each of may   may   may   and may  at the then accreted value the original issue price of the lyons increased by per year 
we currently anticipate funding all of the lyons repurchase obligations in cash 
we believe we have sufficient options in the marketplace to obtain such cash from the proceeds of the issuance of common stock and borrowings of debt 
in addition  we may elect to repurchase all or a portion of the lyons with cash from the same sources prior to may  we also have the right to fund such repurchases with shares of our common stock valued at the current market value at the time of the repurchases  or cash  or a combination of common stock valued at the current market value at the time of the repurchases  and cash 
although we do not intend to do so  if some or all of the lyons were redeemed in common stock  the incremental dilutive shares would be in proportion to the portion converted significantly greater than the dilution based upon the conversion terms reflected above 
on march   pursuant to a tender offer which commenced on february   we completed the purchase of lyons with an amortized value of approximately million and an aggregate principal value of approximately million for a cost of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repurchased additional lyons with an amortized value of approximately million and an aggregate principal value of million for a cost of approximately million 
we have  in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share  computed our diluted earnings per share using the if converted method assumption that the lyons would be converted at the contract rate of shares per  maturity value or an approximate equivalent conversion price of at august  
under this method  for the year ended august   we have reported diluted earnings per share to reflect approximately  additional shares on the basis that the lyons would be converted into common stock at a rate of shares per  maturity value 
for the years ended  august  and  the effect of the lyons convertible debt of  and  incremental shares has been excluded from the calculation of diluted income per share because it was antidilutive 
we have presented the lyons as short term debt as opposed to equity on our balance sheet with the entire balance classified as current as of august  we currently anticipate funding all of the lyons repurchase obligations in cash 
we are currently evaluating our options with respect to any lyons that may be submitted to us for repurchase  and we believe we have sufficient options in the marketplace  including refinancing the lyons repurchase obligation in cash from the proceeds of a combination of the issuance of common stock and borrowings of debt 
therefore  pursuant to sfas no 
 our financial statements do not reflect the effect on diluted earnings per share that could result from the issuance of additional shares of our common stock resulting from the submission by the holders of the lyons for repurchase on the specified anniversary dates 
it is possible that in adverse circumstances  such as a combination of a large number of repurchase requests  low stock price and or liquidity or financing restraints  we could be required to issue a significant number of shares to satisfy our repurchase obligations and the number of shares actually issued could exceed the number of shares presently being used to compute diluted earnings per share see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the issuance of a large number of shares could significantly dilute the value of our common stock and materially affect our earnings per share calculations 
litigation  commitments and contingencies we are subject to various claims  lawsuits  environmental matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based on professional knowledge and experience of our management and legal counsel 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
retirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plans are regularly evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as experts 
in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used  such as the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on investments  or future salary costs  our future pension benefit expenses could increase or decrease 
as of august   we had a minimum pension liability recorded of million 
this liability will likely require us to increase our future cash contributions to the plans 
results of operations the following table presents summary income and expense items as a percentage of revenues year ended august  revenues cost of revenues gross profit general and administrative expenses goodwill amortization operating income interest expense interest income other expense  net income before income taxes and earnings losses from unconsolidated entities provision for income taxes income before earnings losses from unconsolidated entities earnings losses from unconsolidated entities net income fiscal compared to fiscal general our revenues by industry sector were as follows year ended august  industry sector in millions in millions environmental and infrastructure  power generation   process industries other industries the increase in total revenue from to was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from our e i segment  partially reduced by the extended weakness in the domestic power market  which has had a pervasive negative impact on our ecm and fabrication  manufacturing and distribution revenues 
revenue from the power generation sector was approximately million less in fiscal than in fiscal  as revenue from several large gas fired power generation projects  which commenced in fiscal and early fiscal  declined upon completion of those projects 
the decrease in power industry revenue was offset by a million increase in environmental and infrastructure revenue from fiscal to fiscal  due primarily to the acquisition of the it group in may see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  and a million increase in process revenue  due primarily to a  tons per year ethylene plant project in china 
the following tables present our revenues by geographic region year ended august  geographic region in millions in millions united states   asia pacific rim canada europe south america and mexico middle east other revenues for projects in the united states increased million for the year ended august  due primarily to growth in environmental and infrastructure revenues  partially offset by the previously mentioned decline in power generation revenues 
revenues from international projects increased to million for the year ended august  from million for the year ended august  the revenue increase in the asia pacific rim region was primarily the result of the work performed on the ethylene plant in china 
the increase in revenue in canada was due primarily to an environmental consulting unit acquired through the it group acquisition 
backlog by industry sector is as follows at august  industry sector in millions in millions environmental and infrastructure   power generation   process industries other industries the decrease in backlog of million since august  is attributable to reduction in demand for gas fired power generation services  which resulted in a decrease in new orders for our services 
since august   the decline in power generation awards has been partially offset by increases in awards for environmental and infrastructure services  services to the process industry  and nuclear maintenance services 
approximately of the backlog relates to domestic projects and approximately of the backlog relates to work currently anticipated to be completed during the months following august  power generation backlog at august  does not include our million fixed price epc contract signed and announced in september to build a combined cycle power plant in queens  new york 
we expect to include this project in our backlog if and when financing for this project is completed 
backlog is largely a reflection of the broader economic trends being experienced by our customers and is important in anticipating operational needs 
backlog is not a measure defined in generally accepted accounting principles  and our methodology in determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog 
we cannot provide any assurance that revenues projected in our backlog will be realized  or if realized  will result in profits 
the following presents a comparison of our operating results and certain other information for the year ended august  as compared with the year ended august  for our three business segments 
we have conformed our prior year segment financial information to be consistent with our current year presentation of our reorganized segments 
ecm segment year ended august  in millions except in millions except percentages percentages revenues   gross profit gross profit the following tables present ecm revenues from customers in the following industry sectors year ended august  industry sector in millions in millions power generation   process industries other industries the decrease in total segment revenue from fiscal to fiscal was due to the downturn in the domestic power market  specifically the decline in gas fired power generation projects and power engineering and consulting activity which reduced new orders for our ecm services  partially offset by an increase in revenue from process projects and nuclear maintenance and restart projects 
process industry revenues increased primarily due to work on the ethylene plant project in china that is scheduled to continue into fiscal due to the decline in the market for the construction of new gas fired power plants  we anticipate that the ecm segment s revenues will decline in early fiscal as compared with fiscal as remaining in process epc projects booked in and early are completed 
gross profit for the ecm segment for fiscal decreased from fiscal  due primarily to the reduction of estimated margins on certain contracts for the construction of new gas fired power plants  offset by increases in margin on nuclear maintenance and restart projects and the ethylene plant project in china 
the ethylene plant in china contributed significantly more to gross margin in the fourth quarter of than in each of the first three quarters due to a reduction in the estimated cost at completion 
the impact of the reduction in the estimated cost positively impacted gross profit in the fourth quarter of by million 
gross margin for the third and fourth quarters of also was positively impacted by increasing activity on the tva nuclear restart project and recognition of components of project incentives earned based on our performance to date on this project 
further  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in revenue that we earned as a fee for providing a letter of credit to an independent power producer ipp to secure the ipp s power purchase agreement 
as epc projects that began in fiscal and early fiscal are completed and their project costs finalized  the ecm segment s margins have been  and we expect will continue to be  positively or negatively impacted by contract completion negotiations with customers and vendors on such projects 
we recognized million in margin in as a result of the favorable resolution of various contingencies  contract claims and backcharges related to projects that were substantially complete at august  during fiscal  we also recognized million in margin as a result of the favorable resolution of estimated project obligations which were recorded when we acquired stone webster in fiscal gross profit percentage was negatively impacted by the covert and harquahala projects the neg projects  on which we recorded revenues of million during and a million charge million of which resulted from reversal of gross profit recorded prior to fiscal related to the neg projects that negatively impacted the ecm segment s gross profit by for fiscal this charge was a result of increased estimated costs to complete these projects combined with an agreement with the owners of these projects and their lenders that increased the contract prices by a total of million and converted the contracts from target price to fixed price see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the contingencies related to certain cancelled and active ecm projects  including additional discussion of the covert and harquahala projects 
of the million loss recorded during on the neg projects  million was recorded in the fourth quarter reflecting a million increase in estimated cost at completion of the projects  offset by an increase in expected recovery of claims from neg and backcharges and liquidated damages expected from vendors and subcontractors totaling million 
gross profit percentage was negatively impacted by the aes wolf hollow project  on which we recorded revenues of million during with a reversal of previously recorded profit of million 
on this project  we recorded claims receivable from our customer  aes  of million and claims  backcharges and other cost recovery receivables from subcontractors  vendors and others of million see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the wolf hollow project in we believe we have a strong basis for claims and backcharges in excess of the recorded amounts discussed above  however  recovery of the claims and other amounts is dependent upon negotiations with the applicable parties and the results of litigation 
we cannot assure you as to the timing or outcome of these negotiations or results of litigation 
if we collect amounts different than the amounts recorded or if we are held responsible for liquidated damages different than the amounts recorded  we will recognize the difference as income or loss 
we reversed previously recorded profit of million in the fourth quarter of resulting from the settlement with our customer of disputed change orders and other items on our target price epc contract to build a combined cycle cogeneration facility near philadelphia  pennsylvania 
the settlement agreement eliminates our exposure to schedule risk and related liquidated damages  maintains our guaranteed minimum fee and provides for incentives that allow us to earn profit in excess of the minimum fee 
in october  we entered into a settlement agreement with a customer for which we executed three separate projects prior to fiscal under the settlement agreement  we will receive million representing the return of amounts our customer had drawn on our letter of credit and payment for costs incurred which were previously in dispute 
we will record no gain or loss on the settlement because the settlement proceeds are equal to the net assets recorded 
gross profit for the year ended august  was increased cost of revenues decreased by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal for the amortization of contract liability adjustments related to contracts acquired in the stone webster acquisition in see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended august   less ecm segment revenues were derived from large equipment purchases 
such revenues were approximately million for the year ended august   compared to approximately million for the year ended august  segment backlog at august  was approximately billion  compared with approximately billion at august   and was comprised of the following year ended august  industry sector in millions in millions power generation nuclear power   fossil fuel epc other total power generation   process industries other industries total ecm   the ecm segment s backlog has declined from august  because the amount of work performed on power generation contracts was not fully replaced with new orders due to the downturn in demand for power generation services 
our fossil fuel epc backlog does not include our million fixed price epc contract signed and announced in september to build a combined cycle power plant in queens  new york 
we expect to include this project in our backlog  if and when financing for this project is completed 
we anticipate that in the future the ecm segment will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from the power industry including generation from fossil fuel sources and nuclear sources and will increase its revenues from other sectors of the domestic power industry through contracts to re power  refurbish or maintain existing power plants and to provide and install emission control equipment 
although management anticipates that revenues from the power industry in fiscal will be less than in prior years  we expect to continue to design and construct new power plants 
however  due to expected decreases in revenues from the power industry  we expect total revenue from the ecm segment to be lower in than in further  we would expect gross profit percentages from ecm to decline during the first quarter of and return to approximately the levels reported in fiscal over the balance of the year 
e i segment year ended august  in millions except in millions except percentages percentages revenues  gross profit gross profit the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to our acquisition of the it group assets and operations in may  as twelve months of revenues are included in fiscal as compared to four months in fiscal see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to our acquisition of the it group assets and operations in may gross profit was increased cost of revenues decreased by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal for the amortization of asset liability adjustments to the fair value of contracts acquired in the it group acquisition 
in addition  gross profit was increased cost of revenues decreased by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal for the usage of accrued loss reserves related to contracts acquired in the it group acquisition see note and note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the reduction in the gross profit percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to lower margin contracts associated with the businesses acquired in the it group transaction 
the difference in the gross profit percentages between our pre it group environmental and infrastructure operations primarily infrastructure and hazardous material clean up and disposal and those acquired in the it group acquisition environmental clean up  landfills and facilities management is primarily attributable to differences in customers  competition and mix of services 
backlog for the e i segment increased to approximately billion as of august  from approximately billion as of august  we believe the e i segment revenues will increase over the next several years as a result of a combination of factors  including market opportunities in various environmental clean up  homeland security and infrastructure markets and our belief that we will be able to re gain market share which the it group lost while it was experiencing financial difficulties  including the period in which it was in bankruptcy during the first four months of calendar we anticipate that segment revenue for fiscal will be slightly higher than fiscal and we expect gross profit percentages in to be consistent with fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment year ended august  in millions except in millions except percentages percentages revenues gross profit gross profit the decreases in revenues and gross profit percentages in fiscal versus fiscal were attributable to reduced domestic demand  primarily from power generation customers  without offsetting increases in other industry sectors 
the reduced demand for the segment s products has had a negative impact on pricing and gross profit 
backlog for this segment has decreased from million at august  to million at august  this decrease includes a reduction of backlog from one customer in the power industry 
as a result of the current market situation  we have decided to significantly reduce or cease production at certain smaller facilities  consolidate certain operations  and implement certain other cost savings programs for this segment 
further  we have suspended operations at our facility in venezuela due to the political situation in that country 
we expect domestic demand to continue at reduced levels for fiscal  though we are experiencing an increase in inquires in foreign markets for this segment 
demand is strong in the markets serviced by the segment s unconsolidated joint ventures in bahrain and china 
the facility for the china joint venture is under construction and is expected to become operational in late calendar or early given this market outlook  we expect revenues and gross profit levels to remain flat for the fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment over the next few quarters 
unconsolidated subsidiaries during fiscal  we recognized a loss of million net of taxes of million from operations of unconsolidated subsidiaries  including joint ventures  which are accounted for using the equity method 
these losses were primarily attributable to three joint ventures including our entergy shaw  shaw nass and recently created china joint venture 
the entergy shaw joint venture has no active projects as of august  as of august   we have a negative investment balance of million and we expect to continue to fund the joint venture until it is dissolved in fiscal as all projects were completed as of august  the loss in the shaw nass joint venture was due to weaker sales of fabricated pipe in the middle east in fiscal as compared to while the loss in the china joint venture reflects costs incurred in the early stages of the joint venture until its facility is running at full capacity which is scheduled for early calendar year in fiscal  we realized income of approximately million net of taxes of million from the entergy shaw joint venture and losses of million net of taxes of million from shaw nass net of taxes due to the operations of these unconsolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures 
general and administrative expenses  interest expense and income  other income expense  income taxes  and other comprehensive income general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in fiscal  compared with approximately million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal a substantial portion of the approximate million increase in general and administrative costs are attributable to the operations of the e i segment comprised largely of the it group operations which we acquired during the third quarter of fiscal 
we also incurred increased depreciation and facilities costs in fiscal resulting from capital projects and the move into our new corporate facility in baton rouge  louisiana completed in the latter part of fiscal general and administrative expenses are expected to trend slightly downward during as we continue to integrate our administrative functions 
general and administrative costs for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year were reduced by million resulting from the favorable resolution of estimated obligations recorded in the acquisition of stone webster in fiscal interest expense was approximately million in fiscal  compared to approximately million in fiscal the increase over prior year is primarily due to the issuance on march  of approximately million principal amount of year  senior notes  partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to the lyons repurchase with an amortized value of approximately million in march see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our interest costs also include the amortization of loan fees associated with the senior notes  the lyons and the credit facility  as well as unused line of credit and letter of credit fees  and therefore  our interest expense is higher than would be expected based on our borrowing levels and the stated interest rates 
a significant portion of our interest expense accretion of zero coupon discount interest and amortization of loan fees represents non cash charges 
interest income in fiscal decreased to approximately million from million in fiscal as a result of lower levels of invested funds due to use of working capital  cash paid for the repurchase of a portion of the lyons  and the purchase of treasury stock 
for fiscal  other income expense included a charge of approximately million for the write off of i investments in securities available for sale of orion of approximately million  ii accounts and claims receivable due from orion of approximately million  and iii other accounts receivable of approximately million 
also included in other income expense for fiscal were gains of approximately million and million  net of expenses and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs  related to the march and august  respectively  repurchases of portions of the lyons see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal our tax rate is significantly impacted by the mix of foreign including foreign export revenues versus domestic work 
the decrease in the tax rate in fiscal versus fiscal is due primarily to the decrease in income before taxes  and the related increase in the ratio of favorable permanent differences to income before taxes 
additionally  the increased foreign income in fiscal had a lower overall rate of tax than domestic income 
we did not pay any federal income taxes in fiscal primarily because of a taxable loss for the fiscal year and the utilization of operating losses resulting from the it group and stone webster acquisitions 
in fiscal  we established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for the venezuelan net operating losses and in fiscal  we established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for the australian net operating losses 
the valuation allowance reflects our judgment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we believe that the remaining deferred tax assets at august   amounting to million  are realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income 
uncertainties that affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets include the risk of not having future taxable income 
this factor has been considered in determining the valuation allowance 
during fiscal  the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets for two of our united kingdom uk defined benefit retirement plans and our canadian defined benefit retirement plan  and a liability of million  net of tax was recorded see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the increase in the minimum liability is recorded through a direct charge to stockholders equity and is reflected  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheet as of august  this liability will likely require us to increase our future cash contributions to the plan 
fiscal compared to fiscal general our revenues by industry for the periods presented approximated the following amounts year ended august  in millions in millions industry environmental infrastructure power generation  process industries other industries our revenues by geographic region for the periods presented approximated the following amounts year ended august  in millions in millions geographic region united states   asia pacific rim canada europe south america and mexico middle east other the primary reason for the increase in revenue from to was an approximately billion increase in revenues from construction of new gas fired power plants realized by the ecm and fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segments 
additionally  during the third quarter of fiscal  we acquired most of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the it group  a leading provider of environmental and infrastructure services to governmental and commercial customers 
as a result of this acquisition  we formed a new business segment  the e i segment  by combining the acquired it group operations with our existing environmental and infrastructure businesses 
this acquisition increased our revenues from environmental and infrastructure services to million in fiscal  from fiscal revenues of million  an increase of million 
the following table breaks out our backlog in the following industry sectors at august  industry sector in millions in millions power generation   environmental infrastructure  process industries other industries the following presents a comparison of our operating results from fiscal compared with fiscal for our three business segments 
ecm segment year ended august  in millions except in millions except percentages percentages revenues   gross profit gross profit revenues by industry for the ecm segment approximated the following amounts and percentages year ended august  industry sector in millions in millions power generation  process industries other industries revenues from the domestic power generation market accounted for substantially all of the increase from to the increase in revenues was attributable to significant contracts for the construction of new gas fired power plants entered into in fiscal when there was strong demand for these facilities 
most of these contracts were completed in fiscal process industries revenues in fiscal decreased by approximately million  from fiscal this decrease was attributable to industry trends and our decision not to pursue low margin projects similar to those we assumed in the stone webster acquisition in fiscal revenues from other industries increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in domestic revenues 
segment gross profit increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the growth in revenue volume during the year 
gross profit in fiscal years and was increased cost of sales decreased by approximately million and  million respectively  by the utilization of contract adjustments and accrued contract loss reserves that were established to record the fair value of primarily fixed price contracts acquired in the stone webster acquisition 
the gross profit percentage for the year ended august  decreased to from in the prior year 
this decrease in gross margin percentage is attributable to fiscal revenues having a much higher percentage of lower margin revenue as compared with fiscal the lower margins relate primarily to i cost reimbursable contracts entered into in fiscal and ii purchases of large equipment items for power generation contracts 
prior to fiscal  revenues included a higher percentage of fixed price contracts which were generally priced with higher gross margins than cost reimbursable contracts in order to compensate for cost overrun risks 
also during fiscal  revenues from large equipment purchases on behalf of customers were approximately million as compared with approximately million in fiscal and these revenues generally carry a very low gross margin due to the pass through nature of their underlying costs 
segment backlog at august  was approximately billion as compared with approximately billion at august   and was comprised of the following at august  in millions in millions industry sector power generation nuclear power  fossil fuel epc  other total power generation   process industries other industries total ecm   the decline in backlog was primarily because the demand for the construction of new domestic power plants fell dramatically due to questions about future economic growth rates and whether the united states had excess power generation capacity 
further  certain of our independent and merchant power producer customers experienced severe liquidity problems as financing was reduced to these companies and their projects 
as a result of these conditions  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  three customers cancelled or suspended their projects  resulting in a reduction of our backlog of approximately million 
e i segment year ended august  in millions except in millions except percentages percentages revenues gross profit gross profit e i segment revenues in fiscal were million  an increase of million from fiscal revenue of million 
this increase was entirely attributable to our acquisition of the it group assets see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
gross profit in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal gross profit in fiscal was increased cost of revenues decreased by approximately million for the amortization of asset liability adjustments to the fair value of contracts acquired in the it group acquisition see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the gross profit percentage was approximately in fiscal and approximately in fiscal the reduction in the gross profit percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to lower margin contracts that were acquired in the it group transaction 
the difference in the gross profit percentages between our pre it group environmental and infrastructure operations primarily infrastructure and hazardous material clean up and disposal and those acquired in the it group acquisition environmental clean up  landfills and facilities management is primarily attributable to such factors as different customers  competition and mix of services 
backlog in this segment at august  was approximately billion compared with approximately billion at august  this increase was entirely attributable to the it group acquisition 
fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment year ended august  in millions except in millions except percentages percentages revenues gross profit gross profit revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these increases were due primarily to an increased demand in the power industry along with an increase in capacity to handle the demands 
segment backlog was approximately million at august  unconsolidated subsidiaries during fiscal and  we recognized income of million net of taxes of million and a loss of million net of taxes of million  respectively  from the operations of unconsolidated subsidiaries  including joint ventures  which are accounted for under the equity method 
general and administrative expenses  interest expense and income  income taxes and other comprehensive income general and administrative expenses  excluding goodwill amortization  increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from expenses associated with the increase in our revenue and the it group acquisition 
however  as a result of our efforts to control our expenses and economies realized from the integration of stone webster  general and administrative expenses excluding goodwill amortization in fiscal decreased as a percentage of sales to from in fiscal our interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of having convertible debt outstanding for the full fiscal year 
interest income also increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to our investment of a substantial portion of the funds received from the sale of our convertible debt 
however  the interest rates we received on these investments decreased substantially from rates we received in fiscal due to the general decline in interest rates between periods 
our effective tax rates for the years ended august  and were and  respectively 
our estimates of our tax rates are derived from our estimates of pre tax income for each year and the mix of domestic and foreign sourced income  including foreign export sales 
the decrease in the tax rates in fiscal versus fiscal is due primarily to our adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal see note and note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal because we no longer recognize goodwill amortization expense which is only partially deductible for tax purposes in our financial statements 
this decrease was partially offset by increased domestic income in fiscal that has a higher tax rate than most foreign income 
we did not pay any federal income taxes in fiscal and primarily because of our utilization of operating losses resulting from the stone webster acquisition 
additionally  at august   we had recorded a million liability for a uk defined benefit retirement plan also see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources stock repurchase program in september  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase shares of our common stock  depending on market conditions  up to a limit of million 
as of october   we completed our purchases under this program  having purchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
we purchased  shares at a cost of approximately million during the year ended august  and  shares at a cost of approximately million during the first quarter of fiscal credit facilities and liquidity our primary credit facility  dated july  was amended and restated on march  and extended for a three year term from that date 
the amendment reduced the credit facility to million from million  however  we may  by march   increase the credit limit to a maximum of million by allowing one or more lenders to increase their commitment or by adding new lenders 
the credit facility provides that both revolving credit loans and letters of credit may be issued within the million limit of this facility 
in october  we have amended our credit facility to increase the available credit to million and to amend certain of the covenants contained therein  as more fully described below 
the effectiveness of this amendment is conditioned upon the completion of a million equity offering announced on october  under the credit facility  interest is computed  at our option  using either the defined base rate or the defined libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
the terms base rate and libor rate have meanings customary for financings of this type 
the applicable margin is adjusted pursuant to a pricing grid based on ratings by standard and poor s rating services and moody s investor services for the credit facility or  if the credit facility is not rated  the ratings from these services applicable to our senior  unsecured long term indebtedness 
the margins for the credit facility loans may be in a range of i to over libor or ii from the base rate to over the base rate 
at august   the interest rate on the credit facility would have been either if the prime rate index had been chosen or if the libor rate index had been chosen 
at august  and  we did not have outstanding borrowings under the credit facility but had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million and million  respectively 
we are required  with certain exceptions  to prepay loans outstanding under the credit facility with i the proceeds of new indebtedness  ii net cash proceeds from equity sales to third parties if not used for acquisitions or other general corporate purposes within days after receipt  and iii insurance proceeds or condemnation awards in excess of million that are not used to purchase a similar asset or for a like business purpose 
the credit facility is secured by  among other things  i guarantees by our domestic subsidiaries  ii a pledge of all of the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock in certain of our foreign subsidiaries  and iii a security interest in all of our property and the property of our domestic subsidiaries except real estate and equipment 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including a leverage ratio which changes after may   representing the initial date lyons may be submitted by lyons holders for repurchase  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  defined minimum net worth and defined minimum adjusted earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
further  we are required to obtain the consent of the lenders to prepay or amend the terms of the senior notes 
as of august   we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit facility 
the most restrictive of these covenants is the leverage ratio of x  which is the ratio of outstanding debt to twelve month rolling adjusted ebitda as defined in the credit facility 
as of august   our leverage ratio was x  however  as of august   we had cash available that could have been used to reduce outstanding debt in order to improve this ratio 
in may  this leverage ratio covenant requirement will change to x 
conditioned upon the completion of our million equity offering announced on october   the covenants contained in this facility are being amended to provide us with additional flexibility 
the most significant of these changes includes o a reduction in the minimum adjusted ebitda covenant from million to million on a rolling twelve month basis through november  and o an increase in the total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio from x to x as of may we have previously used the credit facility to provide working capital and to fund fixed asset purchases and subsidiary acquisitions 
the credit facility permits us to repurchase million of our lyons obligations 
additional lyons repurchases are also permitted if  after giving effect to the repurchases  we have the availability to borrow up to million under the credit facility and we have the required amounts of cash and cash equivalents 
prior to may   million of cash and cash equivalents is required for purposes of this test and thereafter not less than million 
pursuant to our most recent amendment  this requirement will be decreased to million upon consummation of our proposed equity offering 
cash and cash equivalents for purposes of this test consist of balances not otherwise pledged or escrowed and are reduced by amounts borrowed under the credit facility 
as of august  and  our foreign subsidiaries had short term revolving lines of credit permitting borrowings totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
these subsidiaries had outstanding borrowings under these lines of approximately million and million  respectively  at a weighted average interest rate of approximately and  respectively  at august  and these subsidiaries also had outstanding letters of credit under these lines of million and million  respectively  at august  and  leaving million of availability under these lines at august  at august   we had working capital of approximately million the way in which we calculate working capital is more fully described in note of the notes to our financial statements and unutilized borrowing capacity under our credit facility of approximately million 
our working capital requirements for fiscal will be impacted by a number of factors including o the amount of working capital necessary to support our expanding environmental and infrastructure operations  o the timing and negotiated payment terms of our projects  o our capital expenditures program  o the timing and resolution of claims receivable on major projects  o the sale of non core assets and operations  o cash interest payments on our million principal amount of senior notes which were sold and issued on march   as discussed below  and o our obligation to repurchase the remaining lyons in may if the holders of lyons exercise their right to require us to repurchase the lyons at that time 
pursuant to the terms under which the lyons were issued  we have the ability to repurchase the remaining lyons in either cash or shares of our common stock  or a combination of common stock and cash on may  we currently anticipate funding all of the lyons repurchase obligations in cash 
we believe we have sufficient options in the marketplace to obtain such cash from the proceeds of the issuance of common stock and borrowings of debt 
in addition  we may elect to repurchase all or a portion of the lyons with cash from the same sources prior to may  however  we also have other options  including issuing stock for a portion of the obligations or other alternatives  including refinancing all or a portion of the obligations 
we are currently evaluating our options with respect to lyons that may be submitted to us for repurchase on may  if we refinance the lyons with new debt obligations  our working capital requirements for fiscal will be impacted by cash interest payments due on those obligations 
as a result of these factors  our working capital position is expected to decrease during the next twelve months 
however  we believe that our working capital and unused borrowing capacity  along with anticipated positive cash flow from operations in fiscal  is in excess of our identified short term working capital needs  based on our existing operations  and that we will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity to fund our liquidity needs and repurchase the lyons over the next twelve months 
senior notes in march  we issued  of senior notes due the senior notes bear interest at a rate of and will mature on march  the senior notes are guaranteed  jointly and severally  on a senior unsecured basis  by all of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries 
we may redeem some or all of the senior notes beginning on march  at the redemption prices described in the indenture governing our senior notes 
prior to march   we may  at our option  redeem all  but not less than all  of the senior notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the senior notes plus the applicable premium described in the indenture governing the senior notes and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
if we experience a change of control as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes  we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of repurchase 
the terms of the senior notes place certain limitations on our ability to  among other things o incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  o pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders  o repurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  o make investments  o create liens  o enter into sale leaseback transactions  o incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us  o enter into transactions with our affiliates  and o merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
these limitations are subject to a number of exceptions and qualifications described in the indenture governing the senior notes 
many of the covenants will be suspended during any period when the senior notes have an investment grade rating from standard poor s  a division of the mcgraw hill companies and moody s investors service  inc cash flow for fiscal versus fiscal net cash used in operations was approximately million for fiscal compared with million of net cash provided by operations in fiscal in fiscal  cash was increased by i net income of million  ii deferred tax expense of million  iii depreciation and amortization of million  iv interest accretion and loan fee amortization of million  and v  the write off of an investment in securities available for sale and accounts and claims receivable from orion and other uncollectible receivables of million 
these increases in cash were more than offset by significant decreases in the cash position on long term contracts and by amortization of purchase accounting reserves 
normally  billings and cash receipts on construction contracts exceed costs incurred early in the lives of the contracts and the contracts require net cash outflow later in their lives 
as we are winding down a number of large epc contracts and did not enter into significant new epc contracts in  normal contract execution has required a net use of cash 
in addition  we have recorded a net increase in claims in of approximately million related to cash costs incurred by us  while these claims have been reflected in contract gross profits  cash has not been received 
further  we have been involved in various customer disputes  most significantly nrg  neg and aes see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
claims related to neg resulted in net cash outflow of million in the nrg dispute was settled in october  but resulted in a net cash outflow of million in related to the pike project 
the aes dispute involves unpaid billings  claims  letter of credit draws by aes  and other factors which resulted in a net cash outflow of million in we expect the nrg settlement to result in positive operating cash flows related to this project in in fiscal  we also expect that we will begin new epc projects which will provide cash as down payments are received 
however  the timing of these new projects is uncertain and a single or group of large projects could have a significant impact on sources and uses of cash 
we expect that because of this  changes in working capital could be highly variable from one period to next  although over an extended period of time significant increases and decreases would tend to offset one another 
additionally  we acquired a large number of contracts in the stone webster and it group acquisitions with losses and lower than market rate margins partially due to the effect of the financial difficulties experienced by stone webster and the it group on negotiating and executing contracts prior to acquisition 
a reserve was recorded to reflect the estimated losses on acquired contracts 
for other than insolvent contracts  the contracts were adjusted to their fair value as an asset or liability and the related amortization has the net effect of adjusting cost of revenues for the contracts as they are completed 
cost of revenues was reduced on a net basis by approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively  through the amortization of contract loss reserves and fair value adjustments  which are non cash component of income 
the amortization of these assets and liabilities resulted in a corresponding net increase in gross profit during fiscal and the adjustments are amortized over the lives of the contracts  which for certain it group contracts  will continue for five to ten years 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million in fiscal  compared with net cash used of million for the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  we used cash for acquisitions of million for lfg e  million for envirogen  net of cash received  and million for badger technologies see note of the notes to our financial statements 
we also purchased of property and equipment  as compared to million in fiscal  with the reduction due primarily to the completion of most of our planned system and facilities upgrades 
sales and maturities of marketable securities exceeded purchases by approximately million during fiscal  as compared to fiscal when purchases exceeded sales and maturities by million  with the change due to decreased cash on hand during also during fiscal  we received distributions from our joint ventures and unconsolidated entities of million and made contributions of million 
during fiscal  we used cash of approximately million to fund the it group acquisition and million to fund the psycor acquisition 
net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million in fiscal  compared with million during fiscal during  we received net cash proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior notes 
we also repurchased a portion of the outstanding lyons for million in march  including approximately million of associated tender fees and other expenses see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  subsequent to august   we funded additional repurchases of lyons transacted in late august for million in cash 
also  during the first quarter of  we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock for a cost of approximately million  completing our repurchases under our stock repurchase program see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
during  we repurchased approximately  shares under this program for million 
additionally  we made repayments on debt and leases of million and on our foreign revolving lines of credit of approximately million  and we received approximately million from employees upon the exercise of stock options 
off balance sheet arrangements we provide guarantees to certain of our joint ventures which are reported under the equity method and are not consolidated on our balance sheet 
at august  we had guaranteed approximately million of bank debt or letters of credit and million of performance bonds with respect to our unconsolidated joint ventures 
we would generally be required to perform under these guarantees in the event of default by the joint venture s 
no amounts were recorded related to these guarantees as of august  as of august   we had a negative investment balance of million in an unconsolidated entity  entergy shaw  which we will fund to the extent necessary to complete its operations in early as there are no active projects as of august  the majority of our transactions are in us dollars  however  certain of our foreign subsidiaries conduct their operations in their local currency 
accordingly  there are situations when we believe it is appropriate to use financial hedging instruments generally foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risks when it enters into a transaction denominated in a currency other than its local currency 
the fair value of our hedges was not material at august  as of august   we had an asset and other income on fair value hedges of million million net of taxes that offset transaction losses in the related hedged accounts receivable 
we normally do not use any other type of derivative instrument or participate in any other hedging activities 
commercial commitments our lenders issue letters of credit on our behalf to customers or sureties in connection with our contract performance and in limited circumstances certain other obligations to third parties 
we are required to reimburse the issuers of these letters of credit for any payments which they make pursuant to these letters of credit 
at august   we had both letter of credit commitments and bonding obligations  which were generally issued to secure performance and financial obligations on certain of our construction contracts  which expire as follows commercial commitments amounts of commitment expiration by period in millions less than total year years years after years letters of credit surety bonds total commercial commitments note commercial commitments above exclude any letters of credit or surety bonding obligations associated with outstanding bids or proposals or other work which were not awarded prior to august  additionally  they do not include a letter of credit drawn down in september in the amount of million related to the wolf hollow project see item legal proceedings 
the surety bond commitments above include escrowed cash see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
for the years ended august  and  we made payments to reimburse the issuers of these letters of credit of million and million  respectively  which had a negative impact to our working capital and cash position 
for the year ended august   fees related to these commercial commitments of million were recorded in our statement of income 
as of august   total commercial commitments were as follows commercial commitments amounts of commitment expiration by period in millions less than total year years years after years letters of credit surety bonds total commercial commitments note commercial commitments above exclude any letters of credit or surety bonding obligations associated with outstanding bids or proposals or other work which were not awarded prior to august  the surety bond commitments above include escrowed cash see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the increase in commercial commitments reflects an increase in contracts in our environmental and infrastructure business which often require surety bonds  partially offset by the release of letters of credit upon the completion of milestones on our epc contracts 
aggregate contractual obligations as of august  we had the following contractual obligations contractual obligations payments due by period in millions less than total year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations as of august   we had the following contractual obligations contractual obligations payments due by period in millions less than total year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the reduction in long term debt reflects the repurchase of lyons with a book value totaling million at the dates of repurchase during fiscal offset by the issuance of million senior notes 
capital lease obligations and operating leases have remained consistent as our lease terms continue to expire with few new leases entered into during fiscal see note and note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of long term debt and leases 
also see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies 
effects of inflation we will continue to focus our operations on cost plus or negotiated fixed price contracts 
to the extent that a significant portion of our revenues are earned under cost plus type contracts  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations should generally be low 
however  if we expand our business into markets and geographical areas where fixed price work is more prevalent  inflation may begin to have a larger impact on our results of operations 
to the extent permitted by competition  we intend to continue to emphasize contracts that are either cost plus or negotiated fixed price 
for contracts we accept with fixed price terms  we monitor closely the actual costs on the project as they compare to the budget estimates 
on these projects  we also attempt to secure fixed price commitments from key subcontractors and vendors 
however  due to the competitive nature of our industry  combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel  equipment and materials we traditionally need in order to perform on our contracts  there can be no guarantee that inflation will not affect our result of operations in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued financial accounting series interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
the interpretation also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of interpretation no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and existing variable interest entities at the end of period ending after december  february  for us 
there was no impact to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended august  we have not yet determined what effect  if any  this interpretation will have on our financial statements 
risk factors investing in our common stock will provide an investor with an equity ownership interest 
shareholders will be subject to risks inherent in our business 
the performance of our shares will reflect the performance of our business relative to  among other things  general economic and industry conditions  market conditions and competition 
the value of the investment may increase or decrease and could result in a loss 
an investor should carefully consider the following factors as well as other information contained in this form k  including the discussion of our critical accounting polices  before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock 
this form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including the risk factors described below and the other factors described elsewhere in this form k 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and vulnerable to downturns in the industries to which we market our products and services 
the demand for our products and services depends on conditions in the environmental and infrastructure industries and the power generation industry that accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our backlog as of august   and  to a lesser extent  on conditions in the petrochemical  chemical and refining industries 
these industries historically have been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the domestic and international economies 
for example  in fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  there was a slowdown in construction activity and new construction awards for power generation projects  primarily as a result of less activity by certain independent power producers who had encountered financing and liquidity problems 
these factors contributed to the cancellation or suspension of a number of projects by our customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting in a reduction of our backlog 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a more complete discussion of the potential impact of these cancellations and other factors 
our results of operations have varied and may continue to vary depending on the demand for future projects from these industries 
our results of operations may also be adversely affected by cancellations of existing projects by our customers or difficulties in collecting amounts owed to us for work completed or in progress 
the dollar amount of our backlog  as stated at any given time  is not necessarily indicative of our future earnings 
as of august   our backlog was approximately billion 
there can be no assurance that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or  if realized  will result in profits 
further  project terminations  suspensions or adjustments in scope may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog 
for example  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  three domestic power projects previously reflected in our backlog were suspended or cancelled  resulting in a reduction of our backlog of approximately million 
reductions in backlog due to cancellation by a customer or for other reasons adversely affect  potentially to a material extent  the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts projected in backlog 
in the event of project cancellation  we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog 
in addition  projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time 
if we were to experience significant cancellations or delays of projects in our backlog  our financial condition could be significantly adversely affected 
we define backlog as a working backlog which includes projects for which we have received a commitment from our customers 
this commitment may be in the form of a written contract for a specific project  a purchase order or an indication of the amount of time or material we need to make available for a customer s anticipated project 
in certain instances  the engagement is for a particular product or project for which we estimate anticipated revenue  often based on engineering and design specifications that have not been finalized and may be revised over time 
also  we estimate based on our prior experience the amount of future work we will receive for multi year government contracts for which funding is approved on an annual or periodic basis during the term of the contract 
in the environmental infrastructure segment  many of these contracts are multi year indefinite delivery order  or ido  agreements with the federal government 
these contracts do not initially provide for a specific amount of work  and we derive the contract backlog of ido agreements from our historical experience with ido agreements 
we estimate backlog associated with these ido agreements based on our experience with similar awards and similar customers and such backlog averages approximately of the total unfunded awards 
estimates are reviewed periodically and appropriate adjustments are made to the amounts included in backlog and in unexercised contract options 
our backlog does not include any awards funded or unfunded for work expected to be performed more than five years after the date of our financial statements 
the amount of future actual awards may be more or less than our estimates 
our backlog for maintenance work is derived from maintenance contracts  some of which do not specify actual dollar amounts of maintenance work  in which case our backlog is based on an estimate of work to be performed in light of such customers historic maintenance requirements 
accordingly  the amount of future actual awards may be more or less than our estimates 
we also include in backlog commitments from certain individual customers that have committed to more than one significant epc project and other customers who have committed to multi year orders for environmental  piping or maintenance services 
there can be no assurance that the customers will complete all of these projects or that the projects will be performed in the currently anticipated time frame 
we may incur unexpected liabilities associated with the stone webster and it group acquisitions  as well as other acquisitions 
in july  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets and assumed certain liabilities of stone webster  inc  and during fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets and assumed certain liabilities of the it group  inc we believe  pursuant to the terms of the agreements for the stone webster and it group asset acquisitions  that we assumed only certain liabilities  which we refer to as assumed liabilities  specified in those agreements 
in addition  those agreements provide that certain other liabilities  including but not limited to  certain outstanding borrowings  certain leases  certain contracts in process  completed contracts  claims or litigation that relate to acts or events occurring prior to the acquisition date  and certain employee benefit obligations are specifically excluded from our transactions 
we refer to these as excluded liabilities 
there can be no assurance  however  that we do not have any exposure related to the excluded liabilities 
in addition  some of the former owners of companies that we have acquired are contractually required to indemnify us against liabilities related to the operation of their companies before we acquired them and for misrepresentations made by them in connection with the acquisitions 
in some cases  these former owners may not have the financial ability to meet their indemnification responsibilities 
if this occurs  we may incur unexpected liabilities 
any of these unexpected liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us 
difficulties integrating our acquisitions could adversely affect us 
from time to time  we have made acquisitions to pursue market opportunities  increase our existing capabilities and expand into new areas of operation 
we plan to pursue select acquisitions in the future 
if we are unable to identify acquisition opportunities or complete acquisitions we have identified  our business could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we may encounter difficulties integrating our future acquisitions and in successfully managing the growth we expect from the acquisitions 
in addition  our expansion into new businesses  such as with our it group acquisition  may expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have traditionally experienced 
to the extent we encounter problems in identifying acquisition opportunities or integrating our acquisitions  we could be materially adversely affected 
because we may pursue acquisitions around the world and may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously  we may encounter unforeseen expenses  complications and delays  including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 
our inability to complete acquisitions could impact our growth strategy 
our strategy has been  and continues to be  to grow through acquisitions 
we pursue strategic acquisitions in markets where we currently operate as well as in markets in which we have not previously operated 
we may have difficulties identifying attractive acquisition candidates in the future  or we may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms 
in the event we are unable to complete future strategic acquisitions  we may not grow in accordance with our expectations or our historical experience 
our significant engineering  procurement and construction projects may encounter difficulties that may result in additional costs to us  reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages 
our epc projects generally involve complex design and engineering  significant procurement of equipment and supplies  and extensive construction management that may occur over extended time periods  often in excess of two years 
we may encounter difficulties in the design or engineering equipment and supply delivery  schedule changes  and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  that impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the original delivery schedule 
in addition  we generally rely on third party equipment manufacturers as well as third party subcontractors to assist us with the completion of epc contracts 
in come cases  the equipment we purchase for a project or that is provided to us by the customer does not perform as expected  and these performance failures may result in delays in completion of the project or additional costs to us or the customer to complete the project and  in some cases  may require us to obtain alternate equipment at additional cost 
any delay by subcontractors to complete their portion of the project  or any failure by a subcontractor to satisfactorily complete its portion of the project  and other factors beyond our control may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us to incur additional costs  or both 
these delays and additional costs may be substantial and we may be required to compensate the project customer for these delays 
while we may recover these additional costs from the responsible vendor  subcontractor or other third party  we may not be able to recover all of these costs in all circumstances 
for example  we are currently involved in litigation with the customer and a third party subcontractor relating to the engineering  design  procurement and construction of a gas fired  combined cycle power plant in texas 
in this litigation we are seeking payment from the customer for additional costs incurred by us as a result of a fire at the construction site and certain misrepresentations  and we are seeking payment from a third party equipment vendor for additional costs and liquidated damages potentially payable by us as a result of the failure of a turbine during start up testing 
to the extent we do not receive these amounts  we will recognize a charge to earnings 
for a more complete description of this litigation  see item legal proceedings 
in addition  the project customer may require that it provide us with design or engineering information or with equipment or materials to be used on the project 
in some cases  the customer provides us with deficient design or engineering information or equipment or provides the information or equipment to us later than required by the project schedule 
the project customer may also determine  after commencement of the project  to change various elements of the project 
our epc project contracts generally require the customer to compensate us for additional work or expenses incurred due to customer requested change orders or failure of the customer to prove us with specified design or engineering information or equipment 
under these circumstances  we generally negotiate with the customer with respect to the amount of additional time required and the compensation to be paid to us 
we are subject to the risk that we are unable to obtain  through negotiation  arbitration  litigation or otherwise  adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred by us due to customer requested change orders or failure by the customer to timely provide items required to be provided by the customer 
a failure to obtain adequate compensation for these matters could require us to record an adjustment to amounts of revenue and gross profit that were recognized in prior periods under the percentage of completion accounting method 
any such adjustments  if substantial  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our dependence on subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could adversely affect us 
we rely on third party equipment manufacturers as well as third party subcontractors to complete our projects 
to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired 
if the amount we are required to pay for these goods and services exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed price work  we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts 
in addition  if a subcontractor or a manufacturer is unable to deliver its services  equipment or materials according to the negotiated terms for any reason  including the deterioration of its financial condition  we may be required to purchase the services  equipment or materials from another source at a higher price 
this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the services  equipment or materials were needed 
our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts could adversely affect us 
in certain circumstances  we guarantee facility completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels 
failure to meet any such schedule or performance requirements could result in additional costs  and the amount of such additional costs could exceed project profit margins 
performance problems for existing and future contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within our industry and our client base 
the nature of our contracts could adversely affect us 
although approximately of our backlog as of august  was from cost plus contracts  the remaining was from fixed price or unit price contracts 
a significant number of our domestic piping contracts and substantially all of our international piping contracts are fixed price or unit price 
in addition  a number of the contracts we assumed in the stone webster and it group acquisitions were fixed price contracts  and we will continue to enter into these types of contracts in the future 
under fixed price or unit price contracts  we agree to perform the contract for a fixed price and  as a result  benefit from costs savings and earnings from approved change orders  but we are generally unable to recover any cost overruns to the approved contract price 
under certain incentive contracts  we share with the customer any savings up to a negotiated or target ceiling 
when costs exceed the negotiated ceiling price  we may be required to reduce our fee or to absorb some or all of the cost overruns 
contract prices are established based in part on cost estimates that are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
if these estimates prove inaccurate or circumstances change  cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations 
our profit for these projects could decrease or we could experience losses if we are unable to secure fixed pricing commitments from our suppliers at the time the contracts are entered into or if we experience cost increases for material or labor during the performance of the contracts 
for example  in september  we signed and announced a million fixed price epc contract to build a combined cycle power plant in queens  new york that will be subject to the overrun risks described above 
we enter into contractual agreements with customers for some of our engineering  procurement and construction services to be performed based on agreed upon reimbursable costs and labor rates 
some of these contracts provide for the customer s review of the accounting and cost control systems to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reimbursable costs invoiced 
these reviews could result in reductions in reimbursable costs and labor rates previously billed to the customer 
many of our contracts require us to satisfy specified design  engineering  procurement or construction milestones in order to receive payment for the work completed or equipment or supplies procured prior to achievement of the applicable milestone 
as a result  under these types of arrangements  we may incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of services prior to receipt of payment 
if the customer determines not to proceed with the completion of the project or if the customer defaults on its payment obligations  we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended to purchase equipment or supplies 
in addition  as many of our customers for large epc projects are project specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the epc project 
it may be difficult for us to collect amounts owed to us by these customers against the customer s more credit worthy parent company 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us for these matters  we may be required to record a charge against previously recognized earnings related to the project under percentage of completion accounting 
we are subject to the risks associated with being a government contractor 
we are a major provider of services to governmental agencies and therefore are exposed to risks associated with government contracting 
for example  a reduction in spending by federal government agencies could limit the continued funding of existing contracts with these agencies and could limit our ability to obtain additional contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the risks of government contracting also include the risk of civil and criminal fines and penalties for violations of applicable regulations and statutes and the risk of public scrutiny of our performance at high profile sites 
in addition  government customers typically can terminate or modify any of their contracts with us at their convenience  and some of these government contracts are subject to renewal or extension annually 
if a government customer terminates a contract or fails to renew or extend a contract  our backlog may be reduced or we may incur a loss  either of which could impair our financial condition and operating results 
a termination due to our unsatisfactory performance could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 
in cases where we are a subcontractor  the prime contract under which we are a subcontractor could be terminated  regardless of the quality of our services as a subcontractor or our relationship with the relevant government agency 
our government customers can also reduce the value of existing contracts  issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our services and associated materials 
as a result of our government contracting business  we have been  are and will be in the future  the subject of audits and or cost reviews by the defense contract audit agency  which we refer to as dcaa  or by other contracting agencies 
additionally  we have been and may in the future be the subject of investigations by governmental agencies such as the office of inspector general of the environmental protection agency  which we refer to as epa 
during the course of an audit  the dcaa may disallow costs if it determines that we improperly accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with cost accounting standards or regulatory and contractual requirements 
under the type of cost plus government contracts that we typically perform  only those costs that are reasonable  allocable and allowable are recoverable under the federal acquisition regulation and cost accounting standards 
in addition  our failure to comply with the terms of one or more of our government contracts  other government agreements  or government regulations and statutes could result in our being suspended or barred from future government contract projects for a significant period of time 
this could materially adversely affect our business 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements 
to prepare financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  management is required to make estimates and assumptions  as of the date of the financial statements  which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
areas requiring significant estimates by our management include o contract expenses and profits and application of percentage of completion accounting  o recoverability of inventory and application of lower of cost or market accounting  o provisions for uncollectible receivables and customer claims and recoveries of costs from subcontractors  vendors and others  o provisions for income taxes and related valuation allowances  o recoverability of net goodwill  o recoverability of other intangibles and related amortization  o valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations  and o accruals for estimated liabilities  including litigation and insurance reserves 
our actual results could differ from those estimates 
our use of percentage of completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits 
as is more fully discussed in critical accounting policies and related estimates that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and in the notes to our financial statements  a substantial portion of our revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion  or poc  method of accounting 
this accounting method is standard for engineering  procurement and construction  or epc  contracts 
the poc accounting practices that we use result in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability 
contract losses are recognized in full when determined  and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability 
further  a substantial portion of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that impact the earnings we realize from the contracts  and adjustments related to these incentives and penalties are recorded when known or finalized  which is generally during the latter stages of the contract 
in addition  we record claims when we believe recovery is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
actual collection of claims could differ from estimated amounts 
although most of our contracts are cost plus and our financial loss exposure on cost reimbursable contracts is generally limited to a portion of our gross margin  it is possible that the loss provisions or adjustments to the contract profit and loss resulting from ongoing reviews or contract penalty provisions could be significant and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings 
in certain circumstances it is possible that such adjustments could be material to our operating results 
our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts 
a substantial portion of our revenues is directly or indirectly derived from large scale domestic and international projects 
it is generally very difficult to predict whether and when we will receive such awards as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process which is affected by a number of factors  such as market conditions  financing arrangements  governmental approvals and environmental matters 
because a significant portion of our revenues is generated from large projects  our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards 
in addition  many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and  as a result  we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project 
in certain circumstances  customers may require us to provide credit enhancements  including cash and letters of credit 
for example  our million fixed price epc contract to build a combined cycle power plant in queens  new york is subject to receipt of financing and we have been asked to provide certain credit enhancements 
as a result  a contract award for a project may not result in revenue from the project 
the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs 
in some cases  we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than called for under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on us 
further  our significant customers vary between years  and the loss of any one or more of our key customers could have a material adverse impact on us 
in addition  timing of the revenues  earnings and cash flows from our projects can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control  including unavoidable delays from weather conditions  unavailability of material and equipment from vendors  changes in the scope of services requested by clients or labor disruptions 
we are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve 
downturns in the businesses that use our ecm services can adversely affect our revenues and operating profit 
many of our customers are in businesses that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions 
the demand for our ecm services is dependent upon the existence of projects with engineering  procurement  construction and management needs 
our ecm segment  which primarily services the power generation and process industries  has seen strong growth in the past few years due to previously unmet power needs and deregulation but is now seeing its business opportunities decrease relative to the last few years 
industries such as these and many of the others we serve have historically been and will continue to be vulnerable to general downturns and are cyclical in nature 
as a result  our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in these industries 
political and economic conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 
approximately of our fiscal revenues were attributable to projects in international markets  some of which are subject to political unrest and uncertainty 
we have operations in russia  china  the middle east  europe and australia 
we expect international revenues and operations to continue to contribute to our growth and earnings for the foreseeable future 
international contracts  operations and expansion expose us to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states  including o uncertain economic conditions in the foreign countries in which we make capital investments  operate and sell products and services  o the lack of well developed legal systems in some countries in which we operate and sell products and services  which could make it difficult for us to enforce our contractual rights  o expropriation of property  o restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency  and o political risks  including risks of loss due to civil strife  acts of war  guerrilla activities and insurrection 
for example  in june  we closed our operations in venezuela due to the political unrest and the economic uncertainty of doing business in venezuela 
our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if any of these risks occur 
foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects or to obtain projects 
we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in us dollars  however  from time to time we enter into contracts denominated in a foreign currency 
this practice subjects us to foreign exchange risks  particularly to the extent contract revenues are denominated in a currency different than the contract costs 
we attempt to minimize our exposure from foreign exchange risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies  matching the contract revenue currency with the contract costs currency or entering into hedge contracts when there are different currencies for contract revenues and costs 
however  these actions will not always eliminate all foreign exchange risks 
foreign exchange controls may also adversely affect us 
for instance  foreign exchange controls were instituted in venezuela on february  these controls may limit our ability to repatriate profits from our venezuelan subsidiary or otherwise convert local currency into us dollars 
these limitations could adversely affect us 
further  our ability to obtain international contracts is impacted by the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar to foreign currencies 
our dependence on one or a few customers could adversely affect us 
due to the size of many engineering and construction projects  one or a few clients have in the past and may in the future contribute a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years 
for example  in fiscal  approximately of our revenues were from pg e national energy group  inc similarly  our backlog frequently reflects multiple projects for individual clients  therefore  one major customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a point in time 
an example of this is the tva  with which we have two contracts representing an aggregate of of our backlog at august  including our backlog from tva  a government owned entity  backlog from the us government or us government owned entities accounted for of backlog at august  because these significant customers generally contract with us for specific projects  we may lose these customers from year to year as their projects with us are completed 
if we do not replace them with other customers or other projects  our business could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  we have long standing relationships with many significant customers  including customers with which we have alliance agreements that have preferred pricing arrangements 
however  our contracts with these customers are on a project by project basis  and they may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their purchases at any time 
the loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
our projects expose us to potential professional liability  product liability  warranty and other claims 
we engineer  construct and perform services in large industrial facilities in which accidents or system failures can be disastrous 
any catastrophic occurrences in excess of insurance limits at locations engineered or constructed by us or where our products are installed or services performed could result in significant professional liability  product liability  warranty and other claims against us 
in addition  under some of our contracts  we must use new metals or processes for producing or fabricating pipe for our customers 
the failure of any of these metals or processes could result in warranty claims against us for significant replacement or reworking costs 
further  the engineering and construction projects we perform expose us to additional risks including cost overruns  equipment failures  personal injuries  property damage  shortages of materials and labor  work stoppages  labor disputes  weather problems and unforeseen engineering  architectural  environmental and geological problems 
in addition  once our construction is complete  we may face claims with respect to the performance of these facilities 
our environmental and infrastructure operations may subject us to potential contractual and operational costs and liabilities 
many of our environmental infrastructure segment customers attempt to shift financial and operating risks to the contractor  particularly on projects involving large scale cleanups and or projects where there may be a risk that the contamination could be more extensive or difficult to resolve than previously anticipated 
in this competitive market  customers increasingly try to pressure contractors to accept greater risks of performance  liability for damage or injury to third parties or property and liability for fines and penalties 
prior to our acquisition of the it group  it was involved in claims and litigation involving disputes over such issues 
therefore  it is possible that we could also become involved in similar claims and litigation in the future as a result of our acquisition of the assets of it group and our participation in environmental and infrastructure contracts 
environmental management contractors also potentially face liabilities to third parties for property damage or personal injury stemming from exposure to or a release of toxic substances resulting from a project performed for customers 
these liabilities could arise long after completion of a project 
although the risks we face in our anthrax and other biological agent work are similar to those faced in our toxic chemical emergency response business  the risks posed by attempting to detect and remediate these biological agents may include risks to our employees  subcontractors and those who may be affected should detection and remediation prove less effective than anticipated 
because anthrax and similar contamination is so recent  there may be unknown risks involved  and in certain circumstances there may be no body of knowledge or standard protocols for dealing with these risks 
the risks we face also include the potential ineffectiveness of developing technologies to detect and remediate the contamination  claims for infringement of these technologies  difficulties in working with the smaller  specialized firms that may own these technologies and have detection and remediation capabilities  our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and subcontractors in light of these risks  the high profile nature of the work and the potential unavailability of insurance and indemnification for the risks associated with biological agents and terrorism 
over the past several years  the epa and other federal agencies have constricted significantly the circumstances under which they will indemnify their contractors against liabilities incurred in connection with cercla  and similar projects 
we are exposed to certain risks associated with our integrated environmental solutions businesses 
certain subsidiaries within our environmental infrastructure division are engaged in two similar programs that may involve assumption of a client s environmental remediation obligations and potential claim obligations 
one program involves our subsidiary  the landbank group  inc  or landbank  which was acquired in the it group acquisition 
under this program  landbank purchases and then remediates and or takes other steps to improve environmentally impaired properties 
the second program is operated by our subsidiary shaw environmental liability solutions  llc  which will contractually assume responsibility for environmental matters at a particular site or sites and provide indemnifications for defined cleanup costs and post closing third party claims in return for compensation by the client 
these subsidiaries may operate and or purchase and redevelop environmentally impaired property 
as the owner or operator of such properties  we may be required to clean up all contamination at these sites even if we did not place the contamination there 
we attempt to reduce our exposure to unplanned risks through the performance of environmental due diligence  the use of liability protection provisions of federal laws like the brownfields revitalization act and similar state laws and the purchase of environmental and cost cap insurance coverage or other risk management products 
however  we cannot assure you that our risk management strategies and these products and laws will adequately protect us in all circumstances or that no material adverse impact will occur 
our ability to be profitable in this type of business also depends on our ability to accurately estimate cleanup costs 
while we engage in comprehensive engineering and cost analyses  if we were to materially underestimate the required cost of cleanup at a particular project  such underestimation could significantly adversely affect us 
further  the continued growth of this type of business is dependent upon the availability of environmental and cost cap insurance or other risk management products 
we cannot assure you that such products will continue to be available to us in the future 
moreover  environmental laws and regulations governing the cleanup of contaminated sites are constantly changing 
we cannot predict the effect of future changes to these laws and regulations on our landbank and environmental liability solutions businesses 
in addition  prior to the it group acquisition  we had not previously conducted this type of business and we have had no material transactions in this business 
additionally  when we purchase real estate in this business  we are subject to many of the same risks as real estate developers  including the timely receipt of building and zoning permits  construction delays  the ability of markets to absorb new development projects  market fluctuations and the ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing on satisfactory terms  among others 
environmental factors and changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities and affect the demand for our services 
in addition to the environmental risks described above relating to the businesses acquired from it group and our environmental remediation business  our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations  including those concerning o emissions into the air  o discharges into waterways  o generation  storage  handling  treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  and o health and safety 
our projects often involve highly regulated materials  including hazardous and nuclear materials and wastes 
environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards for regulated materials and require us to obtain a permit and comply with various other requirements 
the improper characterization  handling  or disposal of regulated materials or any other failure to comply with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations or associated environmental permits may result in the assessment of administrative  civil  and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations  or the issuance of injunctions that could restrict or prevent our ability to perform 
in addition  under cercla and comparable state laws  we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated materials 
cercla and these comparable state laws typically impose liability without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release  and liability for the entire cost of clean up can be imposed upon any responsible party 
the principal federal environmental legislation affecting our operating subsidiaries and clients include the national environmental policy act of  or nepa  the resource conservation and recovery act of  or rcra  the clean air act  the federal water pollution control act  and the cercla  together with the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of  or sara 
our foreign operations are also subject to similar governmental controls and restrictions relating to environmental protection 
we could also incur environmental liability at sites where we have been hired by potentially responsible parties  or prps  to remediate contamination of the site 
such prps have sought to expand the reach of cercla  rcra and similar state statutes to make the remediation contractor responsible for cleanup costs 
these companies claim that environmental contractors are owners or operators of hazardous waste facilities or that the contractors arranged for treatment  transportation or disposal of hazardous substances 
if we are held responsible under cercla or rcra for damages caused while performing services or otherwise  we may be forced to incur such cleanup costs by ourselves  notwithstanding the potential availability of contribution or indemnification from other parties 
the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject are constantly changing  and it is impossible to predict the effect of any future changes to these laws and regulations on us 
we do not yet know the full extent  if any  of environmental liabilities associated with many of our recently acquired properties undergoing or scheduled to undergo site restoration  including any liabilities associated with the assets we acquired from stone webster and it group 
we cannot assure you that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations or that any such laws and regulations will not significantly adversely affect us 
the level of enforcement of these laws and regulations also affects the demand for many of our services 
proposed changes in regulations and the perception that enforcement of current environmental laws has been reduced have decreased the demand for some services  as clients have anticipated and adjusted to the potential changes 
future changes could result in increased or decreased demand for some of our services 
the ultimate impact of the proposed changes will depend upon a number of factors  including the overall strength of the economy and clients views on the cost effectiveness of remedies available under the changed regulations 
if proposed or enacted changes materially reduce demand for our environmental services  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
the limitation or the expiration of the price anderson act s indemnification authority could adversely affect our business 
the price anderson act  or paa  comprehensively regulates the manufacture  use and storage of radioactive materials  while promoting the nuclear power industry by offering broad indemnification to nuclear power plant operators and doe contractors 
because we provide services for the doe relating to its nuclear weapons facilities and the nuclear power industry in the on going maintenance and modification  as well as decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear power plants  we are entitled to the indemnification protections under the paa 
although the paa s indemnification provisions are broad  it has not been determined whether such indemnification applies to all liabilities that we might incur while performing services as a radioactive materials cleanup contractor for the doe and the nuclear power industry 
in addition  the paa s ability to indemnify us with respect to any new contract expired on august   but was reauthorized and extended through december  because nuclear power remains controversial  there can be no assurance that the paa s indemnification authority will be reauthorized and extended when that authority expires again at the end of if the paa s indemnification authority is not extended  our business could be adversely affected by either a refusal of plant operators to retain us or our inability to obtain commercially adequate insurance and indemnification 
we face substantial competition in each of our business segments 
in our e i segment  we compete with a diverse array of small and large organizations  including national and regional environmental management firms  national  regional and local architectural  engineering and construction firms  environmental management divisions or subsidiaries of international engineering  construction and systems companies  and waste generators that have developed in house capabilities 
increased competition in this business  combined with changes in client procurement procedures  has resulted in changes in the industry  including among other things  lower contract margins  more fixed price or unit price contracts and contract terms that may increasingly require us to indemnify our clients against damages or injuries to third parties and property and environmental fines and penalties 
we believe  therefore  these market conditions may require us to accept more contractual and performance risk than we have historically for the environmental and infrastructure segment to be competitive 
the entry of large systems contractors and international engineering and construction firms into the environmental services industry has increased competition for major federal government contracts and programs  which have been a primary source of revenue in recent years for our environmental infrastructure business 
there can be no assurance that our e i segment will be able to compete successfully given the intense competition and trends in its industry 
in our engineering  procurement and construction business  we face competition from numerous regional  national and international competitors  many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
our competitors include well established  well financed concerns  both privately and publicly held  including many major power equipment manufacturers and engineering and construction companies  some engineering companies  internal engineering departments at utilities and certain of our customers 
the markets that we serve require substantial resources and particularly highly skilled and experienced technical personnel 
in our pipe engineering and fabrication business  we face substantial competition on a domestic and international level 
in the united states  there are a number of smaller pipe fabricators 
internationally  our principal competitors are divisions of large industrial firms 
some of our competitors  primarily in the international sector  have greater financial and other resources than we do 
our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on us 
our ability to attract and retain qualified engineers  scientists and other professional personnel in accordance with our needs  either through direct hiring or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals  will be an important factor in determining our future success 
the market for these professionals is competitive  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain needed professionals 
in addition  our ability to be successful depends in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled laborers and craftsmen in our pipe fabrication and construction businesses 
demand for these workers can at times be high and the supply extremely limited 
terrorists actions have and could continue to negatively impact the us economy and the markets in which we operate 
terrorist attacks  like those that occurred on september   have contributed to economic instability in the united states  and further acts of terrorism  violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate  our business and our expectations 
there can be no assurance that armed hostilities will not increase or that terrorist attacks  or responses from the united states  will not lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability in the united states 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers and could impact our domestic or international revenues  our supply chain  our production capability and our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business 
if we must write off a significant amount of intangible assets  our earnings will be negatively impacted 
because we have grown in part through acquisitions  goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets 
goodwill was approximately million as of august  if we make additional acquisitions  it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books 
a determination that a significant impairment in value of our unamortized intangible assets has occurred would require us to write off a substantial portion of our assets 
such a write off would negatively affect our earnings 
we are and will continue to be involved in litigation 
we have been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in legal actions claiming damages in connection with engineering and construction projects and other matters 
these are typically actions that arise in the normal course of business  including employment related claims and contractual disputes or claims for personal injury or property damage which occurs in connection with services performed relating to project or construction sites 
our contractual disputes normally involve claims relating to the performance of equipment  design or other engineering services or project construction services provided by our subsidiaries 
our repurchase obligations under the lyons could result in adverse consequences 
in may  we issued million aggregate principal amount at maturity of year  zero coupon  unsecured  convertible debt liquid yield option tm notes  or lyons 
the lyons were issued on an original issue discount basis of per  maturity value of the lyons 
on may of   and  holders of lyons may require us to purchase all or a portion of the lyons at their accreted value the original issue price of lyons increases by per year 
in march  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount at maturity of lyons pursuant to our tender offer for the lyons and in august  we repurchased another million aggregate principal amount at maturity of lyons in open market purchases 
after giving effect to the total repurchases of million aggregate principal amount at maturity of lyons  the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the lyons that remain outstanding is approximately million or a current accreted value of approximately million 
at may   the first date on which the holders can require us to repurchase the lyons  the aggregate accreted value will be million 
the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on october  was per share 
unless our common stock price increases to a price in excess of per share  we anticipate that a substantial portion  and perhaps all  of the remaining outstanding lyons will be submitted for repurchase as early as may  in the event that holders of lyons require us to repurchase the lyons on any of the above dates  we may  subject to certain conditions  choose to redeem the lyons in cash or in shares of our common stock  or in a combination of both 
if we elect to issue our common stock  the value of the common stock would be determined by reference to the current market value of our common stock at the time of each repurchase 
as of august   we anticipate that we would fund the entire repurchase obligation with cash 
assuming that our cash flow from operations through the repurchase date meets our reported projections  we anticipate that we would have sufficient cash resources to repurchase up to the remaining million in accreted value of the lyons with cash on may  however  if we elect to fund all or substantially all of this repurchase obligation with cash  we will substantially reduce our available cash resources or other forms of liquidity 
this could have the effect of restricting our ability to fund new acquisitions or to meet other future working capital needs  as well as increasing our costs of borrowing 
we may seek to refinance or restructure our obligations under the lyons  including the incurrence of additional borrowings  but we may not be successful in doing so or the refinancing or restructuring may result in terms less favorable to us and the holders of the notes than the terms of the lyons 
our amended and restated credit facility dated as of march   permits us to repurchase lyons as long as  after giving effect to the purchase  we have the ability to borrow up to million under that facility and that we have designated amounts of cash and cash equivalents 
prior to may   cash and cash equivalent amounts must be not less than million and thereafter not less than million 
cash and cash equivalents for purposes of this test consist of those sums not otherwise pledged or escrowed under our credit facility and are reduced by amounts borrowed under our credit facility 
in addition  regardless of whether we meet these tests  our amended credit facility permits us to use up to million to repurchase lyons 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to fulfill our obligations under our senior notes and our credit facility 
as of august   we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately million  approximately million of which was secured indebtedness  including obligations under capital leases 
in addition  as of august   letters of credit issued for our account in an aggregate amount of million were outstanding 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences  including the following o it will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  including our outstanding senior notes due  or senior notes  and may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to repurchase the lyons  in each case reducing the availability of cash flow to fund acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  o it will limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements and other purposes  o it will limit our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in our business  o it may place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are more highly leveraged than some of our competitors  o it may make us more vulnerable to a further downturn in the economy of our business  and o it may restrict us from making additional acquisitions or exploiting other business opportunities 
to the extent that new debt is added to our currently anticipated debt level  the substantial leverage risks described above would increase 
restrictive covenants in our credit facility and the indenture relating to the senior notes may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
our credit facility and the indenture relating to the senior notes contain certain restrictions on our ability to  among other things o incur additional indebtedness or contingent obligations or issue preferred stock  o pay dividends or make distributions to our shareholders  o repurchase or redeem our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  o make investments  o create liens  o enter into sale leaseback transactions  o incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us  o make capital expenditures  o enter into transactions with our stockholders and affiliates  o sell assets  and o acquire the assets of  or merge or consolidate with  other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
our credit facility requires us to achieve certain financial ratios  including a leverage ratio which becomes more restrictive over time and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
we may not be able to satisfy these ratios  especially if our operating results fall below management s expectations 
in addition  in order to remain in compliance with the covenants in our credit facility  we may be limited in our flexibility to take actions resulting in non cash charges  including as a result of our settling claims 
these covenants may impair our ability to engage in favorable business activities and our ability to finance future operations or capital needs  including those associated with honoring our repurchase obligations with respect to the lyons 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our credit facility 
in the event of any default under our credit facility  the lenders thereunder will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us and could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable  or require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings 
the acceleration of outstanding loans under our credit facility in excess of million constitutes an event of default with respect to the senior notes 
if we are unable to repay borrowings with respect to our credit facility when due  the lenders thereunder could proceed against their collateral  which consists of substantially all of our assets other than real estate  plants  parts and equipment 
if the indebtedness under our credit facility or the senior notes were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
adverse events could negatively affect our liquidity position 
our operations could require us to utilize large sums of working capital  sometimes on short notice and sometimes without the ability to recover the expenditures 
this has been the experience of certain of our competitors 
circumstances or events which could create large cash outflows include losses resulting from fixed price contracts  environmental liabilities  litigation risks  unexpected costs or losses resulting from acquisitions  contract initiation or completion delays  political conditions  customer payment problems  foreign exchange risks  professional and product liability claims and cash repurchases of our lyons  among others 
we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity or the credit capacity to meet all of our cash needs if we encounter significant working capital requirements as a result of these or other factors 
insufficient liquidity could have important consequences to us 
for example  we could o have less operating flexibility due to restrictions which could be imposed by our creditors  including restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on our properties and paying dividends  o have less success in obtaining new work if our sureties or our lenders were to limit our ability to provide new performance bonds or letters of credit for our projects  o be required to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest associated with that debt  o failure to comply with the terms of our credit facility  o incur increased lending fees  costs and interest rates  and o experience difficulty in financing future acquisitions and or continuing operations 
all or any of these matters could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors with more liquidity and could have a negative impact upon our financial condition and results of operations 
work stoppages and other labor problems could adversely affect us 
some of our employees in the united states and abroad are represented by labor unions 
we experienced a strike  without material impact on pipe production  by union members in february relating to the termination of collective bargaining agreements covering our pipe facilities in walker and prairieville  louisiana 
a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on us 
from time to time we have also experienced attempts to unionize our non union shops 
while these efforts have achieved limited success to date  we cannot give any assurance that we will not experience additional union activity in the future 
changes in technology could adversely affect us  and our competitors may develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology 
we believe that we have a leading position in technologies for the design and construction of ethylene processing plants 
we protect our position through patent registrations  license restrictions and a research and development program 
however  it is possible that others may develop competing processes that could negatively affect our market position 
additionally  we have developed construction and power generation and transmission software which we believe provide competitive advantages 
the advantages currently provided by this software could be at risk if competitors were to develop superior or comparable technologies 
our induction pipe bending technology and capabilities favorably influence our ability to compete successfully 
currently this technology and our proprietary software are not patented 
even though we have some legal protections against the dissemination of this know how  including non disclosure and confidentiality agreements  our efforts to prevent others from using our technology could be time consuming  expensive and ultimately may be unsuccessful or only partially successful 
finally  there is nothing to prevent our competitors from independently attempting to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
our success depends on key members of our management 
our success is dependent upon the continued services of our key officers 
the loss of any of our key officers could adversely affect us 
we do not maintain key employee insurance on any of our executive officers 
market prices of our equity securities have changed significantly and could change further 
the market prices of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control  including the following o the other risk factors described in this form k  including changing demand for our products and services  o a shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors  o changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industry generally  o general conditions in our industries  o general conditions in the securities markets  o issuance of a significant number of shares upon exercise of employee stock options or conversion of the lyons  and o issuance of a significant number of shares of common stock to fund lyons repurchases 
provisions in our articles of incorporation and by laws and rights agreement could make it more difficult to acquire us and may reduce the market price of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and by laws contain certain provisions  such as a provision establishing a classified board of directors in the event the entire board of directors is increased to twelve or more members  provisions entitling holders of shares of common stock that have been beneficially owned for four years or more to five votes per share  a provision prohibiting shareholders from calling special meetings  a provision requiring super majority voting of the outstanding voting power to approve certain business combinations and provisions authorizing the board of directors to issue up to million shares of preferred stock without approval of our shareholders 
also  we have adopted a rights plan that limits the ability of any person to acquire more than of our common stock 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or the removal of management  of deterring potential acquirers from making an offer to our shareholders and of limiting any opportunity to realize premiums over prevailing market prices for the common stock 
provisions of our shareholder rights agreement could also have the effect of deterring changes of control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates  primarily in the united states 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and short term fixed rate investments 
we currently do not use any derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
the table below provides information about our future maturities of principal for outstanding debt instruments including capital leases and fair value at august  in millions 
fair thereafter total value long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate short term line of credit variable rate average interest rate as discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  on may   we issued million face value  year  zero coupon unsecured convertible debt liquid yield option tm notes the lyons for which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
after paying off approximately million of outstanding debt  the remaining proceeds were invested in high quality short term cash equivalents and marketable securities held to maturity 
during fiscal  the income realized from these investments was greater than the interest costs associated with the lyons debt 
however  during fiscal and interest income was less than our interest expense as a result of our utilization of cash for various investments including the it group acquisition  the decline in interest rates available for short term investments  and the amortization of deferred credit costs 
during fiscal  through our tender offer in march and additional repurchases in august  we repurchased a total of million face value of the lyons  leaving million face value outstanding at august  the holders of the lyons have the right to require us to repurchase the lyons on may   may   may   and may  at the then accreted value 
therefore  the debt is presented above as maturing on may  because of the potential for repurchase requests by the debt holders at that time 
at august   the interest rate on our primary credit facility was either if the prime rate index had been chosen or if the libor rate index had been chosen with an availability of million see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our credit facility 
the estimated fair value of long term debt and capital leases as of august  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the convertible debt as of august  was based on recent sales of such debt as of august  the fair value of our other long term debt and capital leases were based on borrowing rates currently available to us for notes with similar terms and average maturities 
foreign currency risks the majority of our transactions are in us dollars  however  certain of our subsidiaries conduct their operations in various foreign currencies 
currently  when considered appropriate  we use hedging instruments to manage our risks associated with our operating activities when an operation enters into a transaction in a currency that is different from its local currency 
in these circumstances  we will frequently utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge the anticipated purchases and or revenues 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching our revenues and expenses in the same currency for our contracts 
as of august   we had a minimal number of forward exchange contracts outstanding that were hedges of certain commitments of foreign subsidiaries 
the exposure from the commitments is not material to our results of operations or financial position see notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements
