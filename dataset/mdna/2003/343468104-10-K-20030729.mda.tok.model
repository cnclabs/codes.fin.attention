item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special risk factors and uncertainties our business has been adversely affected by our overall financial position 
following our announcement of our loss for the third quarter and continued losses for the fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced some reluctance from certain customers to buy from us 
we believe that this may be indicative of fears by customers that we will become unreliable in supplying our products or that our brand image will be harmed 
if our customers lose confidence in our ability to supply quality products reliably  our business may be materially harmed 
in addition  the willingness of suppliers to do business with us or changes in our trade terms with suppliers could negatively impact future margins and costs 
we had a substantial loss in fiscal and fiscal and may continue to incur losses in future periods 
our net loss for the fiscal year ended april  and was million and million  respectively 
as described in this section and the notes to the financial statements  we have begun to significantly restructure our operations 
we believe these restructuring and cost cutting initiatives will reduce overall spending 
if our restructuring efforts fail to adequately reduce costs  or if our sales are less than we project  we may continue to incur losses in future periods 
continued economic weakness in our served markets may adversely affect our ability to meet our sales projections 
we may default on our loan covenants 
we are operating under a new credit agreement with our senior lenders and an amended note agreement with our subordinated lender 
the agreement with our senior lenders expires august  and sets forth specific financial covenants and debt commitment levels to be attained on a quarterly basis 
our subordinated lender has amended the subordinated note agreement to mirror the covenants agreed to by the senior lenders 
in the event of default  the senior and subordinated lenders together  the lenders may limit our access to borrow funds as needed 
our ability to continue operating is dependent on the lenders willingness to grant access to funds so long as we are in compliance with our existing loan covenants 
if we are unable to obtain the necessary funds  our ability to continue operations would be seriously impaired unless we are able to obtain alternative financing from another source 
given our current financial position  obtaining alternative financing is unlikely  especially in the short term 
we may be unable to achieve our projected operating results and maintain compliance with the loan covenants which would trigger an event of default with our lenders 
in an event of default  the lenders would be in the position to exercise default remedies which include applying a default interest rate and acceleration of payment schedules for our outstanding debt 
if the debt were called in such a manner  it is unlikely we would be able to pay off our lenders and we would be subject to the authority of our lenders as provided in the new credit agreement and also in the amended subordinated note agreement 
our lenders may pursue any number of plans to reduce the outstanding debt  including  in certain circumstances  a liquidation of some or all of our assets 
we may be unsuccessful in the implementation of our restructuring plan 
our comprehensive two year restructuring plan includes reductions in headcount  consolidation of facilities and operations  and closure or divestiture of selected operations 
the plan affects roughly half of our locations and reduces the total square footage occupied by nearly half 
we anticipate that headcount will be reduced by more than a quarter 
we have begun consolidating the production of our shapecutting products from our european facilities to our north 
table of contents american facilities and standardizing shapecutting products between the european  north american and asian markets 
as with any restructuring  there are numerous risks that could affect the success of the restructuring  including those mentioned below 
during the period that we are restructuring and perhaps for a period thereafter  we will be subject to risks that companies are exposed to during periods of restructuring 
these risks result from the uncertainties  workforce reductions  facility closings  divestitures of operations  and rapid changes that accompany restructurings 
as a result  one or more of the following adverse consequences could occur to at least some degree the hiring and or retaining of employees may be more difficult  customer and vendor relationships may be damaged  there may be disruptions in the delivery and servicing of product  there may be manufacturing cost overruns  and competitors may try to attract customers by suggesting that we may not be able to successfully restructure 
we may be unable to retain and attract key management positions 
given our current financial position and substantial losses  we may lose key management personnel and encounter difficulties replacing these positions 
we may have to incur greater costs to attract replacement personnel 
we may be unable to satisfy our subordinated obligations through operations 
our subordinated notes mature in two installments of million each on april  and our subordinated lender has also agreed to capitalize the semi annual interest remittances due through april   which total million 
this unpaid interest accrues interest at the rate of and will increase the obligation to the subordinated lender 
in order to satisfy these obligations  we may be required to enter into transactions which could be highly dilutive to current shareholders 
current events on january   stephen r 
light assumed the role of president and ceo 
upon commencement of his employment  mr 
light faced several challenges  including the following our debt levels were very high and not supportable and we were in default of our financial loan covenants with both our lenders 
in addition  our senior credit facility was expiring in september we had a market leadership position in our core ultrahigh pressure cutting business  but the machine tool industry was in recession  and most economic forecasts anticipated it would be several quarters before business levels would show signs of recovery 
the avure business segment was losing money  as the general press business was experiencing a cyclical decline in revenue and the food processing business  while making progress in proving the commercial viability of its products  continued to require further investment to generate sufficient sales volume to become profitable 
we had more than twenty locations throughout the world  burdening us with significant overhead and diminishing our management s focus and direction 
these factors prompted mr 
light to meet with our lenders to discuss strategic alternatives directed toward reducing the current debt levels and improving our operating results 
mr 
light  using the knowledge and previous efforts of his executive team  then developed a comprehensive plan aimed at improving cash flow and profitability by redefining and refocusing our strategy 
this plan is comprised of three primary objectives a obtaining support from our lenders to ensure continued borrowing capability  b conducting a comprehensive financial review of our assets and obligations and c restructuring to reduce structural expenses and resolve current operational issues within the core business 
lender update 
effective april   we entered into a new credit agreement with our senior lenders which was signed on july  this senior credit facility expires august  and bears interest at the bank s prime rate in effect from time to time plus currently 
the agreement sets forth specific 
table of contents financial covenants and debt commitment levels to be attained on a quarterly basis 
the covenants and commitment levels are based on our management s forecast of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal operating results and cash flows 
on july   our subordinated lender has amended the subordinated note agreement  effective april   to mirror those covenants agreed to by the senior lenders and has agreed to capitalize required semi annual interest payments  beginning with april   until april  which total million 
any unpaid interest accrues further charges at the rate of 
comprehensive financial review 
beginning with the third quarter of fiscal  we revised our approach to receivable collection  inventory reduction and investigated other cash generating initiatives in response to the continued declined in the economy and our highly leveraged position 
we reviewed the carrying values of those assets that we expected to convert to cash in the short term  as well as long lived tangible and intangible assets and adjusted the carrying value of such assets to reflect their estimated current net realizable value 
in addition  we conducted a review of potential liabilities 
the total adjustments for the year ended april  are included in the consolidated statement of operations 
these adjustments  which are summarized below  were highly influenced by the economic environment our customers and we are facing 
we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by million 
this increase is based on extensive collection efforts and the results of a worldwide receivable by receivable review  including evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions  which have restricted customers ability to pay their account balances 
we expect that we will negotiate discounts or assign accounts to collection agencies to accelerate cash collections 
we evaluated our ability to convert inventories  including evaluation and demonstration units  into cash in the short term by their sale or disposition 
this evaluation led to a total adjustment of million to arrive at the estimated net realizable value of our inventories 
we conducted a detailed review of the carrying value of our goodwill 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires a company to perform impairment testing when certain triggering events affecting a business unit have occurred 
the triggering events were the expectation of sale or full or partial disposal of certain of our divisions  the continuing deterioration of the economic climate  and our operating losses 
our review resulted in impairment charges of million during the third quarter of fiscal the impairment resulted primarily from continued weakness in the automotive industry  as well as poor performance at our european operations 
our required annual fas review as of april  led to no further impairment charges 
although our former ceo remains obligated to perform consulting services though may  the remaining term of his consulting contract  we have determined that no significant future services are likely to be required of him 
therefore we accrued and charged to operations all remaining contractual fees and related benefits aggregating approximately million 
during the year  we sold million of long term notes receivable for million 
this discount of million plus an additional accrual of million on potential future notes available for sale are recorded in other expense  net 
we have accrued an additional million for potential losses related to several recourse repurchase obligations on european sales 
we have from time to time entered into recourse obligations with third party leasing companies 
in response to continued concerns about the financial health of several customers  as well as a recent bankruptcy  we have revised our estimate of potential future exposure 
included in the million accrual is  for the estimated loss on the repurchase and subsequent sale of a flex form press system  where we have a recourse obligation for a bankrupt customer 
we 
table of contents guaranteed the customer s obligation on this transaction and are taking possession of the unit for future resale 
subsequent to april   we have signed a contract to sell the system which is scheduled to be delivered in may  following refurbishment 
we had deferred million in professional fees associated with previous ongoing strategic transactions  consisting of a planned equity offering and spin off of avure 
we have abandoned these plans and accordingly expensed all of these fees in connection with the recent hiring of the food partners  llc food partners to assist us in conducting a strategic analysis of avure 
we reversed percentage of completion revenue previously recognized on three food systems one customer based on the customer s failure to fulfill its obligations under the contract terms 
the total revenue reversed in the third quarter was million with an associated gross margin of million 
we received new orders for which we plan to deliver already completed systems from inventory 
accordingly  these specific contracts do not qualify for percentage of completion accounting and the corresponding revenue will be recognized upon delivery and acceptance in a later period 
we assessed our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets 
recognizing the magnitude of the losses generated during the fiscal year  we determined it appropriate to establish a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets  with the exception of our swedish operations  amounting to million as well discontinuing  in the near term  any future recognition of deferred tax assets resulting from losses 
based upon our proposed strategy to downsize and streamline our operations and convert non core or excess assets to cash  we adjusted various other asset values and reserves to appropriately reflect their net realizable value on a prospective basis  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
these adjustments totaled million for the year ended april  restructuring 
on february   we announced a comprehensive two year restructuring plan intended to return the company to profitability through reductions in headcount  consolidation of facilities and operations  and closure or divestiture of selected operations 
we expect to invest cash of between million and million in the restructuring program  which will affect roughly half of our locations and will reduce the total square footage occupied by nearly half 
we anticipate that headcount will be reduced by more than one quarter 
we have begun consolidating the production of our shapecutting systems from our european facilities to our north american facilities and standardizing shapecutting systems between the european  north american and asian markets 
we believe that these actions will achieve significant cost savings 
we anticipate being able to fund the restructuring program within our new credit facility  as well as our foreign notes payable 
in addition  we expect to incur significant non cash expenses associated with the implementation of the restructuring program 
under current accounting rules  the associated restructuring expenses will generally be recognized in the period they are incurred 
to date  we have incurred cash expenses of nearly million 
at april   we were considering alternative strategies for the avure segment 
as of that date  we were unsure of the ultimate disposition for avure  but had been considering a wide range of alternatives including continuation of operations in the present form  operations on a diminished scale  suspension of operations  shutdown  or divestiture 
subsequent to year end  we received several offers from potential buyers  however no binding offer has been accepted as of the filing date of this form k 
if a sale were consummated  we would recognize a loss on unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet 
the debit balance of the avure unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments at april  was million 
the ultimate loss on disposal would be determined at the time of sale and would be based on the then carrying value of avure  as well as the amount of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments

waterjet cutting is recognized as a better alternative to traditional cutting methods such as lasers  saws or plasma 
it is faster  has greater versatility in the types of products it can cut and eliminates the need for secondary processing operations 
based upon a change in reporting structure at the beginning of fiscal  we have redefined our two reportable segments  flow waterjet systems waterjet systems and avure technologies avure  replacing the two previous reportable segments of uhp systems and fresher under pressure 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues flow waterjet systems 
the waterjet systems segment includes cutting and cleaning operations  which are focused on providing total solutions for the aerospace  automotive  job shop  surface preparation cleaning and paper industries 
as a result of continued weakness in the machine tool market for the year ended april   waterjet systems revenue decreased to million from million in the prior year 
domestically  we recorded a million or revenue decrease over the prior year period  as compared to the domestic machine cutting tool market  which recorded a year over year decline of  according to the association for manufacturing technology 
our shapecutting equipment business continues to outperform the broader domestic market which demonstrates the ongoing application expansion that flow waterjets are experiencing resulting from their flexibility and superior machine performance 
this decrease in domestic revenues was further exacerbated by weak demand in the domestic automotive and aerospace sectors which was offset slightly by an expansion of our cutting cell applications to non automotive customers 
for the year ended april   domestic waterjet systems revenues were million  down from million for the prior year 

table of contents outside the united states  waterjet systems revenue growth was positively influenced by asia  whose revenues were up for the year ended april  to million  compared to million in the prior year 
these increases were driven largely by sales into china 
additionally  in korea  changes in lending policies have provided capital to small and mid sized businesses flow s traditional customers 
we typically sell our products at higher prices outside the united states due to the costs of servicing these markets 
our european operations have been negatively impacted over the past several months by the continued slowing of the overall economy and weakening customer financial stability 
these marketplace conditions have resulted in a significant decrease in waterjet systems revenues in europe as compared to the prior fiscal year posting a decrease of million or to million compared to million in in an effort to offset any additional future impact  we have put in place a new general manager  changed our pricing structure and accelerated payment terms 
waterjet systems are further comprised of system sales and consumable parts and services sales 
systems are generally comprised of a pump along with the robotics or articulation used to move the cutting or cleaning head 
systems are further broken down between standard cutting systems  standard automotive systems  and special or custom designed systems used primarily in the aerospace and automotive markets 
consumables represent parts used by the pump and cutting head during operation 
systems revenues for the year ended april  were million  a decrease of million or  compared to the prior fiscal year due to the impact of revenue decreases in the us and europe 
consumables revenues  on the other hand  recorded a or million improvement to million for the year ended april   compared to the prior year consumable revenue of million 
this is due to increased machine utilization by our customers which has led to higher parts consumption 
consumables revenue has also been positively impacted by the introduction of proprietary productivity enhancing kits and improved parts availability 
avure technologies revenues 
avure includes the fresher under pressure technology as well as general press operations 
fresher under pressure is focused on providing food safety solutions for food producers  while the general press business manufactures systems which produce and strengthen advanced materials for the aerospace  automotive and medical industries 
as expected  a portion of the decrease in avure s revenues resulted from reduced general press revenues 
for the year ended april   general press revenues were down from million for the prior year to million 
the majority of this revenue decrease occurred in europe and accordingly net consolidated revenues in europe are down over the prior year 
general press revenues will vary from year to year due to the nature of their sales and production cycle 
the sales cycle on one of our general presses can range from one to four years  including a manufacturing period of six to months 
for the year ended april   revenues for fresher under pressure were million  representing a million  or decline  compared to the prior year s revenue of million 
a portion of this decrease can be attributed to the million reversal of percentage of completion revenue previously recognized on three food systems one customer based on the customer s failure to fulfill its obligations under the contract terms 
in addition  we received some orders for which we plan to deliver already completed systems 
accordingly  these specific orders do not qualify for percentage of completion accounting and the corresponding revenue will be recognized upon delivery and acceptance in a later period 
our fresher under pressure technology exposes foods to pressures from  to over  psi for a short time  reducing food borne pathogens such as camplyobacter  e 
coli  listeria monocytogenes  salmonella and vibro vulnificus 
while conventional thermal and chemical preservation methods can ensure safety and longevity  they have a negative impact on fresh foods sensory qualities such as nutrition  flavor  color and texture 
avure s technology uses uhp to destroy bacteria and other microorganisms without using high temperatures or chemical additives with minimal effects on the nutrition  taste  texture  or color of food  while simultaneously extending shelf life 
cost of sales and gross margins 
gross margin for the year ended april  amounted to million or of revenues as compared to gross margin of million or of revenues in the prior year 

table of contents fiscal gross margin was significantly impacted by a number of adjustments posted during our third quarter 
generally  comparison of gross margin rates will vary year to year depending on the mix of sales  which includes special system  standard system and consumables sales 
gross margin rates on our systems sales are typically less than as opposed to consumables sales which are in excess of 
on average  standard systems carry higher margins than the custom engineered systems  which include general presses 
waterjet systems margins represented million of the overall margin or of waterjet systems revenues  while avure margins amounted to million or of avure revenues 
both of our business segments experienced decreased margins resulting in part from adjustments made to the carrying value of inventories to net realizable value  amounting to million in both segments or of revenues 
waterjet systems gross margin was further depressed by weak sales in the automotive and aerospace business which resulted in underabsorption of overhead costs 
in addition  the weakened european economy has led to a change in estimate on several revenue projects in which we had a financial obligation to a third party 
gross margins were negatively impacted by million due to increased revenue reserves based on this change in estimate 
additionally  the decrease in avure gross margins dollars resulted from the revenue reversal of three units due to the customer s failure to fulfill contractual obligations as well as an accrual for the anticipated loss of a general press unit on which the customer defaulted 
these adjustments amounted to million or of total revenues 
marketing expenses 
marketing expenses increased million or to million for the year ended april   as compared to the prior year marketing expenses of million 
the increase stems primarily from an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during the year as a result of our assessment of the financial conditions of our individual customers and general marketplace conditions 
the remainder of the increase is attributable to the completion of the investment in the marketing organization and infrastructure of avure  which now has a complete sales team  and the cost of participation by flow waterjet systems at the bi annual imts tradeshow 
expressed as a percentage of revenue  marketing expenses were and for the years ended april  and  respectively 
research and engineering expenses 
research and engineering expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended april   as compared to the prior year s research and engineering expenses of million 
this reduction is due to our focused global realignment of resources and overall cost cutting efforts 
expressed as a percentage of revenue  research and engineering expenses were and for the years ended april  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended april   as compared to the prior year s general and administrative expenses of million 
these increases stemmed in part from the accrual of our former ceo s severance  the write off of previously deferred professional fees and recruitment and other expenses associated with the hiring of stephen light as the new president and ceo 
additionally  a portion of the increases was due to avure s executive management team being in place for the full year  and only part of the prior year  as well as additional costs associated with bank amendments 
expressed as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended april  and  respectively 
impairment charges 
at january   we conducted a selected review of the carrying value of our goodwill 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires a company to perform impairment testing when certain triggering events affecting a business unit have taken place 
the triggering events were the expectation of a sale or full or partial disposal of certain of our divisions and the continuing deterioration of the economic climate 
our review resulted in impairment charges of million during the quarter ended january  the impairment resulted primarily from continued weakness in the automotive industry  as well as weakness in our european operations 
with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  we prepared an analysis of the fair value of the company s reporting units for our required fas annual assessment 
this assessment  performed as of april   revealed no further impairment 
at april   we also conducted an impairment review of our long lived assets in 
table of contents accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this review led to a million impairment charge related primarily to the carrying value of the depreciable assets of avure 
operating loss 
we recorded an operating loss of million for the year ended april   as compared to operating income of million in the prior year 
interest and other expense  net 
fiscal net interest expense increased million or to million compared to the prior year of million due to a higher weighted average cost of capital and a higher average debt level throughout the first months of the fiscal year 
included in other expense  net are realized foreign exchange transaction gains and losses as well as a million accrual related to a discount agreed to as part of the sale of a substantial portion of our long term notes receivable to a financial institution 
we retain no contingent liabilities associated with this sale 
income taxes 
during fiscal  we assessed our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets 
recognizing the magnitude of the losses generated during the year  we determined it appropriate to establish a valuation allowance to reduce all previously recognized net deferred tax assets to a level offset by deferred tax liabilities  with the exception of our swedish operation 
the valuation allowance of million  recorded during the third fiscal quarter  on net deferred tax assets generated in prior periods  is included in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations and shown as a reduction of both current and long term deferred income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet 
further  we did not recognize deferred tax assets associated with any losses generated in the fourth quarter  with the exception of the swedish operations 
the united states net operating losses can be carried forward years to offset united states profits in future periods 
discontinued operations  net of tax 
as of april   we held one of our service subsidiaries for sale and have consequently shown its results of operations under discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the sale of this subsidiary was consummated may  and resulted in cash proceeds of million and a gain of approximately  the weighted average number of shares outstanding used for the calculation of basic and diluted loss earnings per share is  for fiscal and  for fiscal net loss 
our consolidated net loss for fiscal amounted to million  or basic and diluted loss per share as compared to a net loss of million  or basic and diluted loss per share in the prior year 
waterjet systems reported a net loss of million or basic and diluted loss per share versus net loss of million or basic and diluted loss per share in the comparable prior year 
we have used internally developed estimates to determine the allocation of costs from the consolidated operations to avure s results of operations 
based on these estimates  the net loss for avure was million or basic and diluted loss per share for fiscal compared to a net loss of million or basic and diluted loss per share in the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues our revenues are segregated according to our currently identified segments  waterjet systems and avure  which were redefined effective in fiscal as such  prior year results have been recast to afford comparability 
our total revenues for the year ended april  were million  a decrease of million over the prior year period 
flow waterjet systems revenues decreased million  due to a decline in domestic revenues  impacted by the tightening economy which was further exacerbated by the events of 
table of contents september  this decline was offset in part by a million growth in avure sales 
within avure  general press revenues increased million to million in fiscal fiscal domestic waterjet systems sales decreased as compared to the overall united states machine cutting tool market which declined for the year ended march   according to the association for manufacturing technology amt 
consistent with historical performance  waterjet technology continues to gain market share due to its advantages over traditional cutting technologies  even in a down market 
these advantages  as well as continued product development  should allow us to continue to gain market share  however  growth will be affected by the performance of the broader machine tool market 
systems sales for waterjet systems in fiscal were million  a decrease of million over the prior year resulting from the soft economic conditions which have slowed capital spending decisions 
consumable parts and services revenues decreased million to million in fiscal the slowdown in the consumable sales growth reflects a decrease of machine utilization in the worldwide machine tool market  as well as success of our goal of providing lower operating costs through longer life parts 
fiscal avure revenues of million included million related to food technology or fresher under pressure  a decrease from the fiscal total of million 
this decline from fiscal revenues is the result of a reorganization of the business  including a comprehensive product evaluation and a program to focus on specific markets within the food industry  as well as from purchasing decisions being placed on hold after the events of september  consolidated european revenues of million increased million compared to the prior year and represented of fiscal consolidated revenue 
this increase was spurred by a growth in general press sales of million offset by declining revenues in european shapecutting sales of million resulting from the economic softness in the european market 
sales in the remainder of the world  primarily asia  canada  mexico and south america  decreased to million  the result of weak global economic conditions 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended april  decreased million as compared to the prior fiscal year 
gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal systems sales  including avure  represented of fiscal revenues  slightly higher than the prior year s  and consumables sales represented of fiscal revenues as compared to in the prior year 
the slight decrease in current year gross margin was a function of the increase  as a percentage of total revenues  of general press systems  as compared to standard systems sales 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased million as compared to the prior year 
expressed as a percentage of revenues  total operating expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal marketing expenses of million decreased million as compared to the prior year  but expressed as a percentage of revenues  increased to from in the prior year 
the current year expense decrease results from the lower commission expense associated with lower revenue levels as well as lower trade show expenses  having not incurred imts trade show expenses in fiscal as the show is held every other year 
research and engineering expenses in fiscal decreased million to million as compared to the prior year due to a global realignment of resources 
as a percentage of revenues  research and engineering expenses were in fiscal which is comparable to fiscal general and administrative expenses of million decreased million for the year as compared to the prior year 
a portion of the decrease stems for worldwide staffing reductions as we continue to realign our resources while the remaining million of the decrease stems from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  in may  which discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
expressed as a percentage of revenues however  general and administrative expenses were for both fiscal years 
another component of fas requires that we conduct a periodic evaluation of the carrying value of our goodwill balances 
from this review  we identified and expensed million of asset impairment in our automotive divisions which have been highly impacted from recent economic events 
this amount is reflected in the impairment charges caption on our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents operating income 
operating income can vary significantly for domestic and foreign operations  but is primarily the result of product mix variations and volume from year to year 
the domestic machine tool market extended its weakness into fiscal and the us dollar continued to gain strength over the european currencies 
interest and other expense  net 
net interest expense of million increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in interest expense is due to higher average debt levels associated with the additional financing related to the development of the fresher under pressure program  as well as higher weighted average cost of capital year over year 
average debt outstanding increased million during fiscal compared to the prior year 
this increase in debt was related to funding of the business development of fresher under pressure 
during fiscal  other expense  net  totaled million compared to other expense  net  of  in fiscal this increase is comprised primarily of the write down of two investments to their market value at april  which amounted to million 
income taxes 
the fiscal income tax benefit was computed using a rate of as compared to in the previous year 
the current year tax rate is a blended rate of the various tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
in fiscal  the income tax rate was lower than the statutory rates primarily due to lower foreign tax rates and benefits from the foreign sales corporation 
we regularly evaluate the likelihood of utilizing our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance thereon based on an evaluation of both positive and negative evidence related to these deferred tax assets 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding used for the calculation of basic and diluted loss earnings per share is  for fiscal and  and  respectively  for fiscal cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax 
the effect of the adoption of sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  during fiscal is shown as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax 
net loss 
our consolidated net loss for fiscal amounted to million  or basic and diluted loss per share as compared to net income of million  or basic and diluted earnings per share in the prior year 
waterjet systems reported a net loss of million or basic and diluted loss per share versus net income of million or basic and diluted earnings per share in the prior year 
we have used internally developed estimates to determine the allocation of costs from the consolidated operations to avure s results of operations 
based on these estimates  the net loss for avure was million or basic and diluted loss per share for fiscal compared to net income of million or basic and diluted earnings per share in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources we generated million in cash from operations during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal we generated cash of million as the result of our reduction in operating assets  primarily from the collection of receivables which generated million in cash 
net receivables are comprised of trade accounts and unbilled revenues 
at april   our net receivables balance decreased million or from the april  level of million 
in response to the continued weak global economy  we conducted quarterly reviews of our worldwide trade receivables to assess collectibility 
based on these reviews  we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts by million during the year ended april  we have implemented a strategy to quickly convert receivables to cash and made a concerted effort to collect aged accounts 
we have also implemented procedures to prevent accounts from extending beyond their due dates 
this has led to a million reduction in trade receivables from million at april  to million at april   a decrease 
the majority of the decrease in net 
table of contents receivables stemmed from unbilled revenues of million at april  compared to million at april   a million or decrease 
this decrease is the result of weak demand for our general presses 
receivables can be negatively impacted by the traditionally longer payment cycle outside the united states and the timing of billings and payments on large special system orders 
we do not believe these timing issues will present a material adverse impact on our short term liquidity requirements 
a significant portion of unbilled receivables relates to equipment and systems accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
because of the lead time to build and deliver such equipment  ultimate collection of such accounts can be subject to changing customer business and economic conditions 
in prior years  we had provided long term financing to our food system customers 
during the third quarter of fiscal  in order to accelerate our cash receipts  we sold  without any recourse obligation  million of the notes receivable and received million in cash 
this discount of million plus an additional accrual of million on potential future notes available for sale are recorded in other expense  net  on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended april  inventories at april  decreased million or to million from the april  level of million due to our strategy to convert inventories to cash in the short term by their sale or disposition 
inventory reserve adjustments approximated million 
our future cash commitments include our restructuring plan which currently calls for a cash investment of between million and million over an month period 
we anticipate funding these amounts within our existing credit facilities 
in addition  in july  we committed million to fund the construction of a new manufacturing facility for our taiwanese operations 
as of april   we have a remaining commitment of million  which will be funded over the next six months  through two unsecured lines of credit from taiwanese banks 
we anticipate converting the line of credit to a permanent loan upon completion of the building and are exploring the potential of a sale and leaseback arrangement 
our credit agreements are our primary source of external funding 
on july   we entered into a new credit agreement with our senior lenders  effective april  this new senior credit facility expires august  and bears interest at the bank s prime rate in effect from time to time plus at april  
as of april   giving effect to our new agreement with our senior lenders  we are in compliance with all amended covenants 
we also amended  as of april   our subordinated note agreement to coincide with the new credit agreement with our senior lenders 
prior to signing these agreements  we were in default of our debt covenants 
the subordinated lenders have also capitalized the semi annual interest remittances due from april  through april   which total million 
this capitalized interest accrues at the rate of 
since april   each of the above described agreements has been amended with an effective date of april  concurrent with the signing of the credit agreement and the note amendment  described above  we paid a total of million towards reduction of amounts owing 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has incurred losses during fiscal and in february  we announced a comprehensive two year restructuring plan intended to return the company to profitability through reductions in headcount  consolidation of facilities and operations  and closure or divestiture of selected operations 
we have been able to satisfy our needs for working capital and capital expenditures  due in part to our ability to access adequate financing arrangements 
we expect that operations will continue  with the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
compliance with future debt covenants requires us to meet our operating projections  which include achieving certain revenues  costs  consistent operating margins  and working capital targets 
we believe that our existing cash and credit facilities at april  are adequate to fund our operations through april  if we fail to achieve our planned revenues  costs and working capital objectives  management believes it has the ability to curtail capital expenditures and reduce costs to levels that will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements and debt covenants through april  
table of contents however  demand for our products and timing of cost reductions are difficult to project 
our restructuring initiatives may have unanticipated effects on our business 
if we are unable to comply with the amended debt covenants  and our lenders are unwilling to waive or amend the debt covenants  certain components of our long term obligations and notes payable would become callable  and we would be required to seek alternative financing 
alternative sources of financing may not be available if required or  if available  may not be on satisfactory terms 
if we are unable to obtain alternative financing on satisfactory terms  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  and we may be required to curtail capital spending  further reduce expenses  and otherwise modify our planned operations including potentially discontinuing operations 
the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of april   by due date payments due by period less than year years years after years total long term debt and notes payable operating leases total contractual cash obligations long term debt obligations  notes payable and lease commitments are expected to be met from working capital provided by operations and  as necessary  by other borrowings 
our capital spending plans currently provide for outlays of approximately million in fiscal  primarily related to our taiwan facility 
it is expected that funds necessary for these expenditures will be generated internally and through available credit facilities 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition for standard systems and consumable and services sales  we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab requires that revenue can only be recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue generally is realized or realizable and earned when all four of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criterion is based on our judgments regarding the collectibility of those amounts 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine this criterion is not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 

table of contents for non standard and long lead time systems  including the avure segment  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we use the cost to cost method  measuring the costs incurred on a project at a specified date  as compared to the estimated total cost of the project 
percentage of completion requires management to estimate costs to complete 
accordingly  modifications to estimates will impact percentage of completion revenues and associated gross margins 
if  however  the time from order to install is less than three months  revenue is recognized under sab revenues from equipment on lease are recognized as rental income in the period earned 
shipping revenues and expenses are recorded in revenue and costs of goods sold  respectively 
product warranty reserve our products are generally covered by a warranty up to months 
we accrue a reserve for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase resulting in decreased gross profit 
valuation of accounts receivable we use estimates in determining our allowance for bad debts that are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  we review historical write offs in our receivables 
we have had a low rate of write offs until the present recession 
in determining the appropriate reserve percentages  we also review current trends in the credit quality of our customers  as well as changes in our internal credit policies 
valuation of obsolete excess inventory we currently record a reserve for obsolete or excess inventory for parts and equipment that are no longer used due to design changes to our products or lack of customer demand 
we regularly monitor our inventory levels and  if we identify an excess condition based on our usage and our financial policies  we record a corresponding reserve 
if our estimate for obsolete or excess inventory is understated  gross margins would be reduced 
valuation of deferred tax assets we review our deferred tax assets regularly to determine their realizability 
when evidence exists that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize a deferred tax asset  we set up a valuation allowance against the asset based on our estimate of the amount which will likely not be realizable 
future utilization of deferred tax assets could result in future income 
impairment of patents  other intangibles and goodwill we evaluate patents  other intangibles and acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators as of our fiscal year end and when certain triggering events occur 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on expected operational performance of our operating and acquired businesses  market conditions  legal factors  and future plans 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that any patents  other intangibles and goodwill associated with these businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
expected future operational performance is based on estimates and management s judgment 
many factors will ultimately influence the accuracy of these estimates 

table of contents legal contingencies at any time  we may be involved in certain legal proceedings 
as of april   we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and is based upon an analysis of potential outcomes  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
however  it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  or the effectiveness of our strategies  related to these proceedings 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations provides accounting and reporting standards for recognizing obligations related to asset retirement costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets

fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements ending after december  and have been incorporated into these financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows as the company does not have a significant amount of guarantees 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin which requires extensive disclosures including certain disclosures that are applicable to these financial statements and will require companies to evaluate variable interest entities to determine whether to apply the consolidation provisions of fin to those entities 
companies must apply fin to entities with which they are involved if the entity s equity has specified characteristics 
if it is reasonably possible that a company will have a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity at the date fin s consolidation requirements become effective  the company must disclose the nature  purpose  size and activities of the variable interest entity and the consolidated enterprise s maximum exposure to loss resulting from its involvement with the variable interest entity in all financial statements issued after january  including december  financial statements regardless of when the variable interest entity was created

the amendments set forth in fas improve financial reporting by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly 
fas is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  with a few exceptions and for hedging relationships designated after june  the guidance is to be applied prospectively 
we do not expect the provisions of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exists in our financial instruments related to an increase in interest rates  adverse changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar  as well as financial risk management and derivatives 
these exposures are related to our daily operations 
interest rate exposure interest rate exposure at april   we had million in interest bearing debt 
of this amount  million was fixed rate debt with an interest rate of per annum 
in addition the capitalized interest payments due our subordinated lender are accruing at a rate of per annum 
the majority of the remaining debt of million was variable at a rate of prime or at april  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional contractual information on our debt obligations 
market risk is estimated as the potential for interest rates to increase on the variable rate debt 
a increase in interest rates would result in an approximate additional annual charge to our pretax profits and cash flow of  at april   we had no derivative instruments to offset the risk of interest rate changes 
we may choose to use derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage the risk associated with interest rate changes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  the eurodollar  the japanese yen  the new taiwan dollar  and the swedish krona 
the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations  with functional currencies other than the us dollar  are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
aggregate transaction losses included in the determination of net loss amounted to million for the year ended april  based on our overall currency rate exposure at april   a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
at april   we had two forward exchange contracts to offset the risk of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we may continue to use derivative instruments  such as forward exchange rate contracts  to manage the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes
