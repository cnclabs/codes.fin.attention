critical accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where it is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  it records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected 
for all other customers  it recognizes reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit  adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the agings and changes in current economic conditions 
the company evaluates all aged receivables that are over days old and will reserve specifically on a day basis 
the company s us operations have uniform commercial code ucc filings on all wholegoods each customer purchases 
this allows the company in times of a difficult economy when the customer is unable to pay or has filed for bankruptcy usually chapter  to repossess the customer s inventory 
this allows alamo group to maintain a reserve over its cost which usually represents the margin on the original sales price 
the bad debt reserve balance was  at december  and  at december  the increased requirement was primarily from the acquisition of faucheux and  to a lesser extent  continued soft market conditions in the agricultural sector 
sales discounts at december  the company had  in reserves for sales discounts compared to  at december  on product shipped to our customers under various promotional programs 
the increase was due primarily from additional discounts given on the company s rhino and m w products during the pre season  which runs from september to december of each year 
the company reviews the reserve quarterly based on analysis made on each program outstanding at the time 
the company bases its reserves on historical data relating to discounts taken by the customer under each program 
historically between and of the company s customers who qualify for each program  actually take the discount that is available 
inventories obsolescence and slow moving the company had  at december  and  at december  in reserve to cover obsolescence and slow moving inventory 
the increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of valu bilt and faucheux that occurred during the obsolescence and slow moving policy states that the reserve is to be calculated on a basis of no inventory usage over a three year period and inventory with quantity on hand is deemed obsolete and reserved at percent and slow moving inventory with little usage requires a percent reserve on items that have a quantity greater than a three year supply 
there may be exceptions to the obsolete and slow moving classifications if approved by an officer of the company based on specific identification of an item or items that is deemed to be either included or excluded from this classification 
the reserve is reviewed and if necessary  adjustments made  on a quarterly basis 
the company relies on historical information to support its reserve 
once the inventory is written down  the company does not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is sold 
warranty the company s warranty policy is generally to provide its customer s warranty for up to one year on all whole good units and days for parts 
warranty reserve  as a percent of sales  is calculated by looking at the current twelve months expenses and prorating that based on twelve months sales with a six month lag period 
the company s historical experience is that a customer takes approximately six months from the time he receives the unit and puts it into operation to file any warranty claim 
a warranty reserve is established for each different marketing group 
reserve balances are evaluated on a quarterly basis and adjustments made when required 
the warranty reserve balance was  at december  and  at december  the increase was related to the growth in sales and a higher claims experience primarily in the industrial division 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to various market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk international sales a portion of the company s operations consist of manufacturing and sales activities in international jurisdictions 
the company primarily manufactures its products in the united states  the uk  france  canada and australia 
the company sells its products primarily within the markets where the products are produced  but certain of the company s sales from its uk operations are denominated in other european currencies 
as a result  the company s financials  specifically the value of its foreign assets  could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the other markets in which the subsidiaries of the company distributes their products 
to mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates on the company s functional currency based sales  the company s uk subsidiaries regularly hedge by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge approximately of its future net foreign currency sales transactions over a period of six months 
as of december   the company had  outstanding in forward exchange contracts related to accounts receivable  additionally there was an exchange contract of  relating to a short term inter company cash transfer from the uk to the uk a fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately  however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts should be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
exposure to exchange rates the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominately in european countries  as a result of the sale of its products in international markets 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
at december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would result in a decrease in gross profit of  for the year ending december  comparatively  at december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in gross profit of approximately  for the year ended december  this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices 
the translation adjustment during was a gain of  on december   the british pound closed at 
relative to us dollar  and the euro dollar closed at relative to us dollar 
by comparison  on december   the british pound closed at 
relative to us dollar  and euro dollar closed at 
relative to us dollar 
no assurance can be given as to future valuation of the british pound or euro or how further movements in those or other currencies could affect future earnings or the financial position of the company 
interest rate risk the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s net income is affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and a two hundred basis point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  the company s interest expense would have changed by approximately  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management could take actions to mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such actions 
further  this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
