item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the largest rent to own operator in the united states with an approximate market share based on store count 
at december   we operated  company owned stores nationwide and in puerto rico  including stores located in wisconsin and operated by our subsidiary get it now  llc under the name get it now 
another of our subsidiaries  colortyme  is a national franchisor of rent to own stores 
at december   colortyme had franchised stores in states  of which operated under the colortyme name and stores of which operated under the rent a center name 
our stores generally offer high quality durable products such as home electronics  appliances  computers  and furniture and accessories under flexible rental purchase agreements that generally allow the customer to obtain ownership of the merchandise at the conclusion of an agreed upon rental period 
these rental purchase agreements are designed to appeal to a wide variety of customers by allowing them to obtain merchandise that they might otherwise be unable to obtain due to insufficient cash resources or a lack of access to credit 
these agreements also cater to customers who only have a temporary need  or who simply desire to rent rather than purchase the merchandise 
we have pursued an aggressive growth strategy since we have sought to acquire underperforming stores to which we could apply our operating model as well as open new stores 
as a result  the acquired stores have generally experienced more significant revenue growth during the initial periods following their acquisition than in subsequent periods 
because of significant growth since our formation  particularly the thorn americas acquisition  our historical results of operations and period to period comparisons of such results and other financial data  including the rate of earnings growth  may not be meaningful or indicative of future results 
we plan to accomplish our future growth through selective and opportunistic acquisitions  with an emphasis on new store development 
typically  a newly opened store is profitable on a monthly basis in the ninth to twelfth month after its initial opening 
historically  a typical store has achieved cumulative break even profitability in to months after its initial opening 
total financing requirements of a typical new store approximate  with roughly of that amount relating to the purchase of rental merchandise inventory 
a newly opened store historically has achieved results consistent with other stores that have been operating within the system for greater than two years by the end of its third year of operation 
as a result  our quarterly earnings are impacted by how many new stores we opened during a particular quarter and the quarters preceding it 
there can be no assurance that we will open any new stores in the future  or as to the number  location or profitability thereof 
in addition  to provide any additional funds necessary for the continued pursuit of our operating and growth strategies  we may incur from time to time additional short or long term bank indebtedness and may issue  in public or private transactions  equity and debt securities 
the availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number of factors  some of which will relate to our financial condition and performance  and some of which are beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
if a change in control occurs  rent a center east may be required to offer to repurchase all of its outstanding subordinated notes at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase 
our senior credit facility restricts our ability to repurchase the subordinated notes  including in the event of a change in control 
in addition  a change in control would result in an event of default under our senior credit facilities  which could then be accelerated by our lenders 
in the event a change in control occurs  we cannot be sure we would have enough funds to immediately pay our accelerated senior credit facility obligations and all of the subordinated notes  or that we would be able to obtain financing to do so on favorable terms  if at all 
forward looking statements the statements  other than statements of historical facts  included in this report are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology  such as may  will  would  expect  intend  could  estimate  should  anticipate or believe 
we believe the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are accurate 
however  we cannot assure you that such expectations will occur 
our actual future performance could differ materially from such statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to uncertainties regarding our ability to open new stores  our ability to acquire additional rent to own stores on favorable terms  our ability to enhance the performance of these acquired stores  our ability to control store level costs  our ability to realize benefits from our margin enhancement initiatives  the results of our litigation  the passage of legislation adversely affecting the rent to own industry  interest rates  our ability to collect on our rental purchase agreements  our ability to effectively hedge interest rates on our outstanding debt  changes in our effective tax rate  changes in our stock price and the number of shares of common stock that we may or may not repurchase under our common stock repurchase program  and the other risks detailed from time to time in our sec reports 
additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations are discussed under the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
you should not unduly rely on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
except as required by law  we are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
critical accounting policies involving critical estimates  uncertainties or assessments in our financial statements the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in applying accounting principles  we must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties 
as you might expect  the actual results or outcomes are generally different than the estimated or assumed amounts 
these differences are usually minor and are included in our consolidated financial statements as soon as they are known 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
actual results related to the estimates and assumptions made by us in preparing our consolidated financial statements will emerge over periods of time  such as estimates and assumptions underlying the determination of our self insurance liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by us and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant 
for instance  our liability for our self insured retentions related to our workers compensation  general liability  medical and auto liability may be adjusted based on higher or lower actual loss experience 
although there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these estimates and assumptions because of the period over which actual results may emerge  such risk is mitigated by our ability to make changes to these estimates and assumptions over the same period 
in preparing our financial statements at any point in time  we are also periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings and the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in actions relating to claims that our rental purchase agreements constitute installment sales contracts  violate state usury laws or violate other state laws enacted to protect consumers  claims asserting violations of wage and hour laws in our employment practices  as well as claims we violated the federal securities laws 
we  together with our counsel  make estimates  if determinable  of our probable liabilities and record such amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates represent our best estimate  or may be the minimum range of probable loss when no single best estimate is determinable 
we  together with our counsel  monitor developments related to these legal matters and  when appropriate  adjustments are made to liabilities to reflect current facts and circumstances 
we periodically review the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
one of the methods used for this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible assets exceeds its fair value 
we believe that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable 
changes in estimates of such cash flows and fair value  however  could affect the evaluation 
based on an assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our consolidated financial statements fairly present in all material respects the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of our company as of  and for  the periods presented in this report 
however  we do not suggest that other general risk factors  such as those discussed elsewhere in this report as well as changes in our growth objectives or performance of new or acquired stores  could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized below and in note a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
revenue 
we collect non refundable rental payments and fees in advance  generally on a weekly or monthly basis 
this revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement 
rental purchase agreements generally include a discounted early purchase option 
upon exercise of this option  and upon sale of used merchandise  revenue is recognized as these payments are received 
franchise revenue 
revenue from the sale of rental merchandise is recognized upon shipment of the merchandise to the franchisee 
franchise fee revenue is recognized upon completion of substantially all services and satisfaction of all material conditions required under the terms of the franchise agreement 
depreciation of rental merchandise 
we depreciate our rental merchandise using the income forecasting method 
the income forecasting method of depreciation we use does not consider salvage value and does not allow the depreciation of rental merchandise during periods when it is not generating rental revenue 
the objective of this method of depreciation is to provide for consistent depreciation expense while the merchandise is on rent 
on july   we began accelerating the depreciation on computers that are months old or older and which have become idle using the straight line method for a period of at least six months 
the purpose for this change is to better reflect the depreciable life of a computer in our stores and to encourage the sale of older computers 
though this method will accelerate the depreciation expense on the affected computers  we do not expect it to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
cost of merchandise sold 
cost of merchandise sold represents the book value net of accumulated depreciation of rental merchandise at time of sale 
salaries and other expenses 
salaries and other expenses include all salaries and wages paid to store level employees  together with market managers salaries  travel and occupancy  including any related benefits and taxes  as well as all store level general and administrative expenses and selling  advertising  insurance  occupancy  fixed asset depreciation and other operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate overhead expenses related to our headquarters such as salaries  taxes and benefits  occupancy  administrative and other operating expenses  as well as regional directors salaries  travel and office expenses 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles consists primarily of the amortization of the excess of purchase price over the fair market value of acquired assets and liabilities 
effective january   under sfas all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization 
sfas requires that an impairment test be conducted annually and in the event of an impairment indicator 
we conducted our transition test in which showed no impairment of our goodwill 
following the adoption of sfas  our primary source of amortization comes from customer relationships and non compete agreements 
recent developments rent way acquisition 
in february  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of rent to own stores from rent way  inc for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash

liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million in from million in this increase primarily resulted from an increase in net earnings  a decrease in the amount of rental merchandise purchased during and an increase in deferred income taxes offset by a reduction in accrued liabilities 
cash used in investing activities decreased by million to million in from million in this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in the amount of capital expenditures made in versus  offset by an increase in the amount spent on new store acquisitions in versus cash used in financing activities increased by million to million in  compared to net cash provided of million in this increase is a result of our purchase of million in treasury stock  the repurchase of million of our subordinated notes and an increase in debt prepayments of million during the year ended december  as compared to in addition  there were no proceeds from the issuance of common stock or debt in  as compared to proceeds of approximately million in liquidity requirements 
our primary liquidity requirements are for debt service  rental merchandise purchases  capital expenditures  litigation and our store expansion program 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  borrowings and sales of debt and equity securities 
in the future  we may incur additional debt  or may issue debt or equity securities to finance our operating and growth strategies 
the availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number of factors  some of which relate to our financial condition and performance  and some of which are beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  or if available  that it will be on terms we find acceptable 
we believe that the cash flow generated from operations  together with amounts available under our senior credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements  rental merchandise purchases  capital expenditures  litigation and our store expansion programs during our revolving credit facilities provide us with revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding million  of which million was available at march  at march   we had million in cash 
while our operating cash flow has been strong and we expect this strength to continue  our liquidity could be negatively impacted if we do not remain as profitable as we expect 
on march   president bush signed into law the job creation and worker assistance act of  which provides for accelerated tax depreciation deductions for qualifying assets placed in service between september  and september  under these provisions  percent of the basis of qualifying property is deductible in the year the property is placed in service  with the remaining percent of the basis depreciated under the normal tax depreciation rules 
accordingly  our cash flow will benefit from having a lower current cash tax obligation  which in turn will provide additional cash flows from operations until the deferred tax liabilities begin to reverse 
we estimate that our operating cash flow will increase by approximately million through before the deferred tax liabilities begin to reverse over a three year period beginning in rental merchandise purchases 
we purchased million  million and million of rental merchandise during the years  and  respectively 
capital expenditures 
we make capital expenditures in order to maintain our existing operations as well as for new capital assets in new and acquired stores 
we spent million  million and million on capital expenditures in the years  and  respectively  and expect to spend approximately million in acquisitions and new store openings 
during  we continued our strategy of increasing our store base through opening new stores  as well as through opportunistic acquisitions 
we spent approximately million acquiring stores and accounts for the year ended december  it is our intention to increase the number of stores we operate by an average of approximately per year over the next several years 
in february  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of rent to own stores from rent way  inc for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
of the aggregate purchase price  we held back million to pay for various indemnified liabilities and expenses  if any 
we funded the acquisition entirely from cash on hand 
of the stores acquired  store were merged with our existing store locations 
the profitability of our stores tends to grow at a slower rate approximately five years from the time we open or acquire them 
as a result  in order for us to show improvements in our profitability  it is important for us to continue to open stores in new locations or acquire underperforming stores on favorable terms 
there can be no assurance we will be able to acquire or open new stores at the rates we expect  or at all 
we cannot assure you the stores we do acquire or open will be profitable at the same levels that our current stores are  or at all 
borrowings 
the table below shows the scheduled maturity dates of our senior debt outstanding at december  year ending december  in thousands under our senior credit facilities  we are required to use of the net proceeds from any equity offering to repay our term loans 
in addition  we intend to continue to make prepayments of debt under our senior credit facilities  repurchase some of rent a center east s outstanding subordinated notes or repurchase our common stock under our common stock repurchase program to the extent we have available cash that is not necessary for store openings or acquisitions 
however  we cannot assure you that we will have excess cash for these purposes 
senior credit facilities 
the senior credit facilities are provided by a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions led by jpmorgan chase bank  as administrative agent 
at december   we had a total of million outstanding under the senior credit facility related to our term loans and million of availability under the revolving credit line portion of the senior credit facility 
on december   we amended and restated our senior credit facility to account for our internal corporate reorganization  to restate previous amendments increasing the amounts of our common stock we are permitted to re purchase and to provide for a new tranche d lc facility in an aggregate amount at closing equal to million to support our outstanding letters of credit 
under this new tranche d lc facility  in the event that a letter of credit is drawn upon  we have the right to either repay the tranche d lc facility lenders the amount withdrawn or request a loan in that amount 
interest on any requested tranche d lc facility loan accrues at an adjusted prime rate plus or  at our option  at the eurodollar base rate plus  with the entire amount of the tranche d lc facility due on december  borrowings under the senior credit facilities bear interest at varying rates equal to to over the eurodollar rate  which was at december  we also have a prime rate option under the facilities  but have not exercised it to date 
for the year ended december   the average effective rate on outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facilities was  before considering the interest rate swap agreements as described below  and  after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements in effect during during  we entered into interest rate protection agreements with two banks  one of which expired in under the terms of the current interest rate agreements  the eurodollar rate used to calculate the interest rate charged on our million outstanding senior term debt has been fixed at an average rate of 
of the million under protection  million expires in august and the remaining million expires in september the senior credit facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets  including intellectual property and real property 
the senior credit facilities are also secured by a pledge of the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
the senior credit facilities contain covenants  including without limitation  covenants that generally limit our ability to incur additional debt including subordinated debt in excess of million at any one time outstanding  repurchase our capital stock and senior subordinated notes  incur liens or other encumbrances  merge  consolidate or sell substantially all our property or business  sell assets  other than inventory in the ordinary course of business  make investments or acquisitions unless we meet financial tests and other requirements  make capital expenditures  or enter into a new line of business 
the senior credit facilities require us to comply with several financial covenants  including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio  a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
at december   the maximum consolidated leverage ratio was  the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio was  and the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio was on that date  our actual ratios were  and  respectively 
events of default under the senior credit facilities include customary events  such as a cross acceleration provision in the event that we default on other debt 
in addition  an event of default under the senior credit facilities would occur if we undergo a change of control 
this is defined to include the case where a third party becomes the beneficial owner of or more of our voting stock or certain changes in our board of directors occur 
subordinated notes 
in august  rent a center east issued million of senior subordinated notes  maturing on august   under an indenture dated as of august  among rent a center east  its subsidiary guarantors and the trustee  which is now the bank of new york  as successor to ibj schroder bank trust company 
in december  rent a center east issued an additional million of senior subordinated notes  maturing on august   under a separate indenture dated as of december  among rent a center east  its subsidiary guarantors and the bank of new york  as trustee 
on may   rent a center east closed an exchange offer for  among other things  all of the notes issued by it under the indenture  such that all of the senior subordinated notes are now governed by the terms of the indenture 
the indenture contains covenants that limit rent a center east s ability to incur additional debt  sell assets or our subsidiaries  grant liens to third parties  pay dividends or repurchase stock  and engage in a merger or sell substantially all of our assets 
events of default under the indenture include customary events  such as a cross acceleration provision in the event that we default in the payment of other debt due at maturity or upon acceleration for default in an amount exceeding million 
the notes may be redeemed on or after august   at our option  in whole or in part  at a premium declining from 
the subordinated notes also require that upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined in the indenture  the holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of the original aggregate principal amount  together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of repurchase 
if rent a center east did not comply with this repurchase obligation  this would trigger an event of default under our senior credit facilities 
store leases 
we lease space for all of our stores as well as our corporate and regional offices under operating leases expiring at various times through colortyme guarantee 
colortyme is a party to an agreement with textron financial corporation  who generally provides million in aggregate financing to qualifying franchisees of colortyme of up to five times their average monthly revenues 
under this agreement  upon an event of default by the franchisee under agreements governing this financing and upon the occurrence of certain other events  textron may assign the loans and the collateral securing such loans to colortyme  with colortyme then succeeding to the rights of textron under the debt agreements  including the rights to foreclose on the collateral 
an additional million of financing is provided by texas capital bank  national association under an arrangement similar to the textron financing 
we guarantee the obligations of colortyme under these agreements up to a maximum amount of million  of which million was outstanding as of december  mark e 
speese  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  is a passive investor in texas capital bank  owning less than of its outstanding equity 
litigation 
in  we recorded an accrual of approximately million for estimated probable losses on litigation assumed in connection with the thorn americas acquisition 
as of december   we have paid approximately million of this accrual in settlement of most of these matters and legal fees 
these settlements were funded primarily from amounts available under our senior credit facilities  including the revolving credit facility and the multidraw facility  as well as from cash flow from operations 
on november   we signed a settlement agreement settling the wisconsin attorney general matter  which was approved by the court on the same day 
under the terms of the settlement  we created a restitution fund in the amount of million for our eligible wisconsin customers who had completed or active transactions with us as of september  in addition  we paid million to the state of wisconsin for fines  penalties  costs and fees 
the settlement of this matter was fully reserved for in our financial statements 
a portion of the restitution fund is allocated for customers with completed transactions as of september   and the balance is allocated for restitution on active transactions as of september   which will be allowed to terminate according to their terms when customers either acquire or return the merchandise 
restitution will be offered on the active transactions when all such active transactions have terminated  which we anticipate will occur by the fall of any unclaimed restitution funds at the conclusion of the restitution period will be returned to us 
to the extent the amount in the restitution fund is insufficient to pay the required amount of restitution  we are obligated to provide additional funds to do so 
however  we believe the amount in the restitution fund allocated for the active transactions  together with the amount of funds we anticipate will remain unclaimed by customers with completed transactions  will be sufficient to pay the required amount of restitution on all eligible active transactions

dividends on our series a preferred stock accrue on a quarterly basis at the rate of per annum 
prior to the conversion of all but two shares of our series a preferred stock in august  we paid these dividends in additional shares of series a preferred stock because of restrictive provisions in our senior credit facilities 
we have the ability to pay the dividends in cash and may do so under our senior credit facilities so long as we are not in default

in may  apollo exercised one of their two rights to request that their shares be registered and an affiliate of bear stearns elected to participate in such registration 
in connection therewith  apollo and an affiliate of bear stearns converted  shares of our series a preferred stock held by them into  shares of our common stock  which they sold in the may public offering that was the subject of apollo s request

repurchases of outstanding securities 
in connection with the retirement of j 
ernest talley  our former chairman of the board and chief executive officer  we entered into an agreement to repurchase million worth of shares of our common stock beneficially held by mr 
talley at a purchase price equal to the average closing price of our common stock over the trading days beginning october   subject to a maximum of per share and a minimum of per share 
under this formula  the purchase price for the repurchase was calculated at per share 
accordingly  on october  we repurchased  shares of our common stock beneficially held by mr 
talley at per share for a total purchase price of million  and on november   we repurchased an additional  shares of our common stock beneficially held by mr 
talley at per share  for a total purchase price of an additional million

economic conditions 
although our performance has not suffered in previous economic downturns  we cannot assure you that demand for our products  particularly in higher price ranges  will not significantly decrease in the event of a prolonged recession 
seasonality 
our revenue mix is moderately seasonal  with the first quarter of each fiscal year generally providing higher merchandise sales than any other quarter during a fiscal year  primarily related to federal income tax refunds 
generally  our customers will more frequently exercise their early purchase option on their existing rental purchase agreements or purchase pre leased merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of each fiscal year 
we expect this trend to continue in future periods 
furthermore  we tend to experience slower growth in the number of rental purchase agreements on rent in the third quarter of each fiscal year when compared to other quarters throughout the year 
as a result  we would expect revenues for the third quarter of each fiscal year to remain relatively flat with the prior quarter 
we expect this trend to continue in future periods unless we add significantly to our store base during the third quarter of future fiscal years as a result of new store openings or opportunistic acquisitions 
effect of new accounting pronouncements accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in june  the fasb issued statement  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires entities to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when liabilities are incurred rather than when the entity commits to an exit or disposal plan  as currently required 
examples of costs covered by this guidance include one time employee termination benefits  costs to terminate contracts other than capital leases  costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees  and certain other exit or disposal activities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will impact any exit or disposal activities we initiate after that date 
stock based employee compensation 
in december  the fasb issued statement sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement sfas  to provide alternative transition methods for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in annual financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the pro forma effect on reported results of applying the fair value based method for entities that use the intrinsic value method of accounting 
the pro forma effect disclosures are also required to be prominently disclosed in interim period financial statements 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  and is effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december   with earlier application permitted 
we do not plan to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation at this time and have included the disclosure requirements of sfas in the accompanying financial statements 
accounting for guarantees 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires a guarantor entity  at the inception of a guarantee covered by the measurement provisions of the interpretation  to record a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
we previously did not record a liability when guaranteeing obligations unless it became probable that we would have to perform under the guarantee 
fin applies prospectively to guarantees we issue or modify subsequent to december   but has certain disclosure requirements effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  we have historically issued guarantees related to our colortyme franchisees and other limited purposes and do not anticipate fin will have a material effect on our financial statements 
disclosures required by fin are included in the accompanying financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  for certain entities that do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of fin will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we are in the process of determining what impact  if any  the adoption of the provisions of fin will have upon our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity as of december   we had million in subordinated notes outstanding at a fixed interest rate of and million in term loans outstanding at interest rates indexed to the libor rate 
the subordinated notes mature on august  the fair value of the subordinated notes is estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality 
the fair value of the subordinated notes at december  was million  which is million above their carrying value 
unlike the subordinated notes  the million in term loans have variable interest rates indexed to current libor rates 
because the variable rate structure exposes us to the risk of increased interest cost if interest rates rise  in we entered into million in interest rate swap agreements that lock in a libor rate of  thus hedging this risk 
of the million in agreements  million expired in september and the remaining million will expire in  of which million will expire on august  and the remaining million will expire on september  the swap agreements had an aggregate negative fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical change in the libor rate would have affected the fair value of the swaps by approximately million 
market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by fluctuations in interest rates 
our primary market risk exposure is fluctuations in interest rates 
monitoring and managing this risk is a continual process carried out by the board of directors and senior management 
we manage our market risk based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
interest rate risk we hold long term debt with variable interest rates indexed to prime or libor that exposes us to the risk of increased interest costs if interest rates rise 
to reduce the risk related to unfavorable interest rate movements  we have entered into certain interest rate swap contracts on million of debt to pay a fixed rate of
