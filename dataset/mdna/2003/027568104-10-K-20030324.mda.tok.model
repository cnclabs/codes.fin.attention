critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the company s portfolio of mortgage loans and notes is periodically evaluated for possible impairment to establish appropriate loan loss reserves  if necessary 
the company s advisor has a credit review committee which meets each month 
this committee reviews the status of each of the company s loans and notes  and maintains a watch list of loans including loans for which the company has issued guarantees for which the underlying property may be experiencing construction cost overruns  delays in construction completion  occupancy shortfalls  lower than expected debt service coverage ratios  or other matters which might cause the borrower to be unable to make the interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
if a loan is experiencing difficulties  members of this credit committee work with the borrower to try to resolve the issues  which could include extending the loan term  making additional advances  or reducing required payments 
if  in the judgment of company management  it is determined that is probable that the company will not receive all contractually required payments when they are due  the loan or note would be deemed impaired  and a loan loss reserve established 
as of december   all mortgage loans and notes are current and management has determined that none of these assets are impaired and that no loan loss reserve is necessary 
the company s gnma certificates are carried at estimated fair values 
changes in these valuations do not impact the company s income or cash flows  but affect shareholders equity 
gnma certificates are relatively liquid investments 
the company uses quoted market prices as its primary source of valuation information 
during  the company converted three of its first mortgage loans into investments in gnma certificates 
the conversion was made solely to improve the leveragability of the debt instruments from as an fha mortgage to as a gnma certificate  and to reduce the interest rate on the associated borrowings from libor bps to libor bps 
it is the company s intention to hold its gnma certificates to maturity  but the company elected the available for sale designation under sfas to give it the flexibility to liquidate these assets if business conditions require 
the first mortgage loans remaining in the portfolio will not be converted to gnma certificates and  along with future originations of first mortgage loans  are intended to be held to maturity 
the company s mezzanine investments of approximately million at december  bear interest at fixed rates  but also include provisions that allow the company to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s excess cash flows from operations and excess proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  company management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate  using the guidance contained in the third notice to practitioners issued by the aicpa 
although the accounting methodology does not affect the company s cash flows from these investments  this determination affects the balance sheet classification of the investments as well as the classification  timing and amounts of reported earnings 
accounting for the investment as real estate is required if the company expects that the amount of profit  whether called interest or another name  such as an equity kicker  that it expects to receive above a reasonable amount of interest and fees  is over percent of the property s total expected residual profit 
if a mezzanine investment were to be accounted for as an investment in real estate  the company s balance sheet would show the underlying property and its related senior debt if such debt were not also held by the company  and the income statement would include the property s rental revenues  operating expenses and depreciation 
if the company expects that it will receive less than percent of the property s residual profit  then loan or joint venture accounting is applied 
loan accounting is appropriate if the borrower has a substantial equity investment in the property  if the company has recourse to substantial assets of the borrower  if the property is generating sufficient cash flow to service normal loan amortization  or if certain other conditions are met 
under loan accounting  the company recognizes interest income as earned and additional interest from participations as received 
joint venture accounting would require that the company only record its share of the net income from the underlying property 
company management must exercise judgment in making the required accounting determinations 
for each mezzanine arrangement  the company projects total cash flows over the loan s term and the company s share in those cash flows  and considers the borrower s equity  the contractual cap  if any  on total yield to the company over the term of the loan  market yields on comparable loans  borrower guarantees  and other factors in making its assessment of the proper accounting 
to date  the company has determined that all mezzanine investments are properly accounted for as loans 
based on the company s experience with similar arrangements  management has taken the position that the likelihood that any of the commitments  with the exception of a standby bridge loan commitment granted to fund the construction of clark s crossing apartments in the approximate amount of million  will be exercised is remote 
therefore  the fees received for a commitment to originate a loan are recognized over the commitment period on a straight line basis in other income 
if however  management believes that the likelihood that the commitments will be exercised is possible or probable  the commitment fees will be deferred and  if the commitment is exercised  recognized over the life of the loan as an adjustment of yield  or  if the commitment expires unexercised  recognized in other income upon expiration of the commitment 
management is not aware of any trends or events  commitments or uncertainties  which have not otherwise been disclosed that will or are likely to impact liquidity in a material way 
commitments and contingencies the company entered into a loan program with fannie mae  which agreed to fully fund the origination of million of delegated underwriter and servicer loans for apartment properties that qualify for low income housing tax credits under section of the internal revenue code 
under the loan program  the company intended to originate and contract for individual loans of up to million each over a two year period in conjunction with american property financing  an unaffiliated third party  which would underwrite and service the loans for fannie mae 
the company guarantees a first loss position of up to million  depending on the aggregate principal amount of the loans the company originates under this program and would receive guaranty  loan origination and other fees 
the company also guarantees construction loans for which it has issued a forward commitment to originate a loan under the fannie mae program  with respect to which it guarantees repayment of of such construction loans 
as of december   the company has originated loans totaling approximately million under the fannie mae program and has made forward commitments for an additional approximate million 
the company s maximum guaranty at december  was million 
during august  the company purchased one first mortgage loan in the amount of  due to a default on a construction loan that was guaranteed by the company under the fannie mae program 
the loan defaulted due to problems relating to construction issues of alexandrine square  a unit apartment complex in detroit  michigan 
subsequent to creating this program  the level of loan origination competition has increased  reducing the program s projected financing value and profitability 
as a result  the company decided in the first quarter of to discontinue this program 
the company has reached an agreement in principle to terminate this program and transfer its rights and obligations to a third party 
there can be no assurance  however  that this agreement will be consummated 
accordingly  during the first quarter of  the company wrote off the balance of unamortized deferred costs relating to this program 
this write off totaled approximately  and is included in fannie mae loan program expenses in the consolidated statement of income 
except for the write off of the program costs described above  the fannie mae loan program has not had  and its discontinuance is not anticipated to have  a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations

during october  the company entered into an agreement with wachovia bank  national association wachovia to provide stabilization guarantees for new construction of multi family properties under the lihtc program 
wachovia already provides construction and stabilization guarantees to fannie mae  for loans wachovia originates under the fannie mae lihtc forward commitment loan program  but only for loans within regions of the country wachovia has designated to be within its territory 
for loans outside wachovia s territory  the company has agreed to issue a stabilization guarantee  for the benefit of wachovia 
the company is guarantying that properties which have completed construction will stabilize and the associated construction loans will convert to permanent fannie mae loans 
the company receives origination and guarantee fees from the developers for providing the guarantees 
if the properties do not stabilize with enough net operating income for fannie mae to fully fund their commitment  amac may be required to purchase the construction loan from wachovia or to fund the difference between the construction loan amount and the reduced fannie mae permanent loan amount

in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
the disclosure provisions of this interpretation are included in note the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company currently receives a fee  in advance  for acting as guarantor of certain construction loans 
this fee is deferred and amortized over the guarantee period 
the company believes that the fee received approximates the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee  therefore  the company s current accounting for these guarantees will not be affected by this interpretation

inflation inflation did not have a material effect on the company s results for the periods presented 
item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which the investments of the company are exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
interest rate risk interest rate fluctuations can adversely affect the company s income and value of its common shares in many ways and present a variety of risks  including the risk of mismatch between asset yields and borrowing rates  variances in the yield curve and changing prepayment rates 
the company s operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income from its assets net of credit losses and its borrowing costs 
most of the company s assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  gnma certificates  and notes receivable  generate fixed returns and will have terms in excess of five years 
the company funds the origination and acquisition of a significant portion of these assets with borrowings which have interest rates that reset relatively rapidly  such as monthly or quarterly 
in most cases  the income from assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of borrowings  creating a mismatch between asset yields and borrowing rates 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may influence the company s net income 
the company s borrowings under repurchase and warehouse agreements bear interest at rates that fluctuate with libor 
based on the approximate million of borrowings outstanding under these facilities at december   a change in libor would impact the company s annual net income and cash flows by approximately  increases in these rates will decrease the net income and market value of the company s net assets 
interest rate fluctuations that result in interest expense exceeding interest income would result in operating losses 
the value of the company s assets may be affected by prepayment rates on investments 
prepayment rates are influenced by changes in current interest rates and a variety of economic  geographic and other factors beyond the company s control  and consequently  such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty 
when the company originates mortgage loans  it expects that such mortgage loans will have a measure of protection from prepayment in the form of prepayment lock out periods or prepayment penalties 
however  such protection may not be available with respect to investments which the company acquires  but does not originate 
in periods of declining mortgage interest rates  prepayments on mortgages generally increase 
if general interest rates decline as well  the proceeds of such prepayments received during such periods are likely to be reinvested by the company in assets yielding less than the yields on the investments that were prepaid 
in addition  the market value of mortgage investments may  because of the risk of prepayment  benefit less from declining interest rates than from other fixed income securities 
conversely  in periods of rising interest rates  prepayments on mortgages generally decrease  in which case the company would not have the prepayment proceeds available to invest in assets with higher yields 
under certain interest rate and prepayment scenarios the company may fail to recoup fully its cost of acquisition of certain investments 
real estate risk multi family and commercial property values and net operating income derived from such properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of housing  retail  industrial  office or other commercial space  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  age and design  demographic factors  retroactive changes to building or similar codes  and increases in operating expenses such as energy costs 
in the event net operating income decreases  a borrower may have difficulty paying the company s mortgage loan  which could result in losses to the company 
in addition  decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the company s mortgage loans  which could also cause the company to suffer losses 
risk in owning subordinated interests the company has invested indirectly in subordinated cmbs through its ownership of a million preferred membership interest in arcap 
subordinated cmbs of the type in which arcap invests include first loss and non investment grade subordinated interests 
a first loss security is the most subordinate class in a structure and accordingly is the first to bear the loss upon a default on restructuring or liquidation of the underlying collateral and the last to receive payment of interest and principal 
such classes are subject to special risks  including a greater risk of loss of principal and non payment of interest than more senior  rated classes 
the market values of subordinated interests in cmbs and other subordinated securities tend to be more sensitive to changes in economic conditions than more senior  rated classes 
as a result of these and other factors  subordinated interests generally are not actively traded and may not provide holders with liquidity of investment 
with respect to the company s investment in arcap  the ability to transfer the membership interest in arcap is further limited by the terms of arcap s operating agreement 
participating interest in connection with the acquisition and origination of mortgages  the company has  on occasion  obtained and may continue to obtain participating interests that may entitle it to payments based upon a development s cash flow  profits or any increase in the value of the development that would be realized upon a refinancing or sale of the development 
competition for participating interests is dependent to a large degree upon market conditions 
participating interests are more difficult to obtain when mortgage financing is available at relatively low interest rates 
in the current interest rate environment  the company may have greater difficulty obtaining participating interest 
participating interests are not government insured or guaranteed and are therefore subject to the general risks inherent in real estate investments 
therefore  even if the company is successful in investing in mortgage investments which provide for participating interests  there can be no assurance that such interests will result in additional payments 
repurchase facility collateral risk repurchase agreements involve the risk that the market value of the securities sold by the company may decline and that the company will be required to post additional collateral  reduce the amount borrowed or suffer forced sales of the collateral 
if forced sales were made at prices lower than the carrying value of the collateral  the company would experience additional losses 
if the company is forced to liquidate these assets to repay borrowings  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain compliance with the reit asset and source of income requirements
