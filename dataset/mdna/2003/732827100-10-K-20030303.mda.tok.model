table of contents part i item business introduction pope talbot  inc the company is a pulp and wood products company  founded in  with headquarters in portland  oregon 
the company s primary operations are located in oregon  south dakota and british columbia  canada 
the company had  employees as of december  the company s common stock trades on the new york and pacific stock exchanges under the symbol pop 
the company s pulp business manufactures and sells northern bleached softwood kraft nbsk chip and sawdust pulp for use in the manufacture of newsprint  tissue and high grade coated and uncoated paper 
the company s wood products business manufactures and sells standardized and specialty lumber  residual wood chips  and other by products 
the pulp business operates three pulp mills  located in halsey  oregon and nanaimo and mackenzie  british columbia  with approximately  metric tons of total annual capacity 
the wood products business operates three sawmills in british columbia and one sawmill in the black hills region of south dakota  with total estimated annual capacity of million board feet 
pulp is sold globally  while lumber is sold primarily in the united states and canada 
company strengths strong market pulp and lumber earnings leverage market prices for both pulp and lumber were at very low levels in the company expects to benefit significantly from potential future price increases  as its earnings are highly leveraged to pulp and lumber prices 
for example  assuming other costs remain constant  at a production capacity of  metric tons of pulp  a per metric ton price improvement would result in additional annual pre tax income of approximately million 
similarly  with a lumber capacity of  thousand board feet  again assuming other costs remain constant  a per thousand board feet price improvement would result in additional annual pre duty and pre tax income of approximately million 
the following chart illustrates the annual average gross real prices of nbsk pulp for the last years logo 
table of contents the following chart illustrates the annual average gross prices of net real western spruce pine fir spf lumber for the last years logo cost reduction measures the company has made considerable efforts to improve its cost structure 
since  pulp production costs per metric ton have been reduced by percent and lumber production costs per thousand board feet have been reduced by percent 
also since  fiber cost per metric ton to the pulp mills have been reduced by percent and log costs per thousand board feet to the sawmills have been reduced by percent 
highlights of the company s efforts include reduced head count from to at the harmac pulp mill since savings of million annually at the halsey pulp mill from modification implemented in during the first year of ownership  reduced the mackenzie pulp mill production costs per metric ton by percent and increased production by percent 
consolidated sawmill production in the black hills to a single facility 
long term supply arrangements the company has long term relationships with many of its suppliers and has entered into long term supply agreements with some of them to reduce potential supply volatility 
higher margin sawdust pulp to provide a low cost and adequate supply of wood fiber  the company has expanded its capacity to use sawdust as a raw material for a significant portion of the halsey and mackenzie pulp production 
traditionally  sawdust is purchased at a significant discount to chips 
in addition  the price of sawdust does not fluctuate as much as the price of chips with pulp price changes 
the company believes nbsk sawdust pulp typically results in improved margins relative to traditional nbsk chip pulp due to the lower priced fiber source 

table of contents environmental compliance the company is committed to excellence in environmental performance by conducting business in a manner that safeguards the environment and that complies with all environmental laws and regulations 
accordingly  the company believes it is in material compliance with all current requirements of the us environmental protection agency  the oregon department of environmental quality  the south dakota department of environmental natural resources and the british columbia ministry of water  land and air protection 
historical development of the company s business the company  a delaware corporation  was originally incorporated as a california corporation in it is the successor to a partnership formed in san francisco  california in that acquired its first timberlands and opened a lumber mill in the seattle  washington area in subsequently  the company developed a lumber business based on timberland and facilities in the us pacific northwest  british columbia  canada and the black hills region of south dakota and wyoming 
until the sale of the tissue business in  the company produced a line of consumer tissue products including towels  napkins  bathroom tissue and facial tissue 
also  the company produced disposable diaper products until the sale of the diaper business 
these products were sold under private and controlled labels 
the sale of the assets of the company s tissue business in was classified as income from discontinued operations 
see item selected financial data 
since the mid s  the company has reduced its dependency on timber from the us pacific northwest  where environmental concerns have sharply restricted the availability of and increased the cost of public timber 
at the same time  the company increased its operations in regions having more stable timber supplies  particularly in british columbia and to a lesser extent the black hills region of south dakota and wyoming 
in  the company distributed its timber and land development properties in the state of washington to its shareholders through interests in a newly formed master limited partnership  pope resources 
in  the company sold its oregon sawmill  and the company has since sold its remaining oregon timberlands 
in  the company acquired a sawmill in castlegar  british columbia and related timber cutting rights 
at the end of  the company permanently closed its port gamble  washington sawmill 
the small  million board foot sawmill in newcastle  wyoming was closed in as part of the company s effort to rationalize its black hills production facilities due to a reduction in public timber availability in that region 
in the late s  the company expanded into the pulp business with the purchase of the halsey  oregon pulp mill 
the halsey mill produces bleached kraft pulp which is sold to writing paper  tissue and newsprint manufacturers in the us  europe and asia 
through a number of purchases in and  the company acquired a percent ownership interest in harmac pacific inc harmac 
on november   the company acquired the remaining minority interest in harmac 
the harmac acquisition was accounted for as a step purchase transaction  and the results of operations of harmac have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements from february  harmac  which was publicly traded on the toronto  vancouver and montreal stock exchanges  operated a pulp mill located on the east coast of vancouver island at nanaimo  british columbia  canada 
harmac was merged into the company s canadian subsidiary  pope talbot ltd  in december during  the company continued its strategy of increasing and improving the company s position in the pulp business 
on june   the company acquired the mackenzie pulp mill  located in the northern interior of british columbia  canada  from norske skog canada 
with the mackenzie acquisition  the company s pulp production capacity increased to  metric tons annually 
in addition  the company increased its ability to offer customers additional types of products 

table of contents pulp business the company operates pulp mills located in halsey  oregon the halsey mill  nanaimo  british columbia the harmac mill and mackenzie  british columbia the mackenzie mill 
halsey mill operations and fiber supply the halsey mill  with a capacity of approximately  metric tons  produces nbsk pulp that is sold in various forms to printing and writing paper  tissue  and newsprint manufacturers in the pacific northwest and in the open market 
capital investments to upgrade the halsey mill have totaled million over the last years  primarily related to its chlorine dioxide facility 
the installation of this facility made the mill compliant with the environmental protection agency s cluster rules 
substantially all of the company s wood chip and sawdust requirements for the halsey pulp mill are satisfied through purchases from third parties 
the company has long term chip and sawdust supply arrangements or established supplier relationships with sawmills and veneer plants in the pacific northwest 
to provide an adequate supply of wood fiber for the mill  the company has expanded its capability of using sawdust as a raw material 
in  approximately percent of halsey s production was sawdust pulp 
additionally  the company continues to use an expanded geographic base to maintain an adequate supply of chips for the portion of the halsey pulp mill s production which is based on softwood chips 
the company believes that  based on existing wood chip and sawdust availability both within the willamette valley region of oregon and from other sources  fiber resources will be adequate for the company s requirements at the halsey pulp mill in the foreseeable future 
in conjunction with the fiber acquisition program for the halsey pulp mill  the company brokered wood chips for sale primarily into the export market until the first quarter of  when the company discontinued brokering wood chips 
harmac mill operations and fiber supply with a current annual capacity of approximately  metric tons  the harmac mill is one of the largest producers of market pulp in canada  according to pricewaterhousecoopers llp s global market pulp survey of the harmac mill manufactures a wide range of high quality nbsk pulp made from custom blends of western hemlock  balsam  western red cedar and douglas fir 
the company has a long term fiber supply agreement for the harmac mill with weyerhaeuser company limited weyerhaeuser that provides for million cubic meters of fiber per year through  which represents approximately percent of harmac s fiber requirements 
under this contract  fiber is purchased at market prices  or at prices determined under a formula intended to reflect fair market value of the fiber  and which takes into account the net sales value of pulp sold by the harmac mill 
weyerhaeuser has agreed that it will supply  in addition to the minimum volumes to which it is committed under the long term fiber agreement  the fiber required to fulfill the balance of the harmac mill s operating requirements  provided that such fiber is available in the market without detriment to weyerhaeuser s own operations 
in addition  the company has entered into arrangements with other independent fiber suppliers to provide pulp fiber incremental to that provided by weyerhaeuser 
to a limited degree  the harmac mill also has the ability to acquire wood chips from the company s canadian sawmills 
improved utilization and recovery of available raw materials  through means such as the chip conditioning system completed in  aids in fiber utilization and quality 
the chip conditioning system consists of an industry standard set of chip thickness screens that separate oversized and undersized chip fragments and reprocesses the unacceptable wood chips to increase fiber quality and utilization 

table of contents mackenzie mill operations and fiber supply in june  the company purchased the mackenzie pulp mill from norske skog canada 
located in northern british columbia  the mackenzie pulp mill is known for producing a particularly fine grade of nbsk pulp from chips and sawdust 
a synergistic fit with the company s existing harmac and halsey pulp mills  the mackenzie facility provides the company the ability to offer customers additional types of products and increased the company s production capacity by  metric tons  or percent 
the mackenzie pulp mill s capacity consists of  metric tons per year of sawdust based pulp and  metric tons of long fiber pulp 
the company s mackenzie pulp mill purchased approximately percent of its fiber requirements in from sawmills also located in mackenzie  british columbia and operated by slocan forest products ltd 
slocan  primarily under long term  evergreen contracts 
under these contracts  fiber is purchased at market prices  or at prices determined under a formula intended to reflect the fair market value of the fiber  and which takes into account the net sales value of pulp sold by the mackenzie mill 
the company has entered into arrangements with other independent fiber suppliers to provide fiber incremental to that provided by slocan 
the company believes there is an abundance of fiber resources available within an economic radius of the mill that will be adequate for the mackenzie pulp mill s requirements 
marketing and distribution the company s pulp is marketed globally through sales offices in portland  oregon and brussels  belgium and through agency sales offices around the world 
in  approximately percent of the pulp segment s revenues were derived from sales to europe  percent to asia and percent to north america and other markets 
the company sold pulp products to numerous customers during  none of which accounted for more than percent of total revenues 
in  approximately percent of pulp was sold to customers at market prices under long term or evergreen contracts  renewable each year 
approximately percent was sold to other repetitive customers without contract  with the balance sold on a spot basis 
by establishing and maintaining long term contractual relationships  the company is better able to forecast and regulate production 
backlog the company s pulp customers either enter into contracts for periods of one to three years or purchase pulp on a spot basis 
the contractual customers provide the company with annual estimates of their requirements  followed by periodic orders based on more definitive information 
at december   the company s backlog of orders believed to be firm for both contractual and non contractual customers was million compared with million at december  the backlog of pulp orders at year end represents orders which will be filled in the first quarter of the following year 
competition the pulp industry is highly competitive  with a substantial number of competitors having extensive financial resources  manufacturing expertise and sales and distribution organizations  many of which are larger than the company  but none of which is believed to be dominant 
canada and the nordic countries produce substantially more market pulp than they consume  with the surplus being sold in western europe  the united states and japan and other asian countries 
canada  finland  norway and sweden are the principal suppliers of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp to world markets 
the united states is a large exporter of hardwood and southern softwood pulp 
latin america also exports both hardwood and softwood pulp 
the principal methods of competition in the pulp market are price  quality  volume  reliability of supply and customer service 
the company s competitive advantages include the strength of its northern softwood fiber and the variety and consistent quality of the pulp it produces 
in addition  harmac has the operational flexibility provided by its three separate production lines in combination with the three principal species of fiber available in the region

wood products business the company s wood products business involves the manufacture and sale of dimension and board lumber 
total estimated annual capacity approximates million board feet 
wood chips and other materials obtained as a by product of the company s lumber operations are also sold 
during the last three years  revenues from lumber sales were approximately percent or more of total wood products revenues with the balance being wood chips  other residuals and logs 
logs  which are raw material for the company s wood products operations are obtained through long term cutting licenses on public lands  open log market purchases  competitive bidding from federal agencies and long term contracts on private lands 
approximately percent of the company s current lumber capacity is located in british columbia  canada and percent in the black hills region of south dakota 
for the company s canadian sawmills  approximately percent of the timber requirements in were obtained from the provincial government of british columbia under long term cutting licenses on million acres of public lands with the remaining percent purchased in competitive open log markets 
in the black hills  the company obtained approximately percent of its timber requirements in from public sources under long term timber harvesting contracts  percent from private sources under long term harvesting contracts and percent was purchased in competitive open log markets 
approximately percent of all timberlands in british columbia are owned by the province of british columbia and administered by the ministry of forests 
the forest act empowers the ministry of forests to grant timber tenures  including tree farm licenses tfls  forest licenses fls  and timber licenses 
the annual allocable cut aac for timber tenures is determined by the ministry of forests on a sustained yield basis and reflects timber conditions  regional and local economic and social interests  and environmental considerations 
the actual cut from a tfl or fl for any given year may vary up to percent above or below the designated aac for the tenure as long as the annual average cut over a five year prescribed period is within percent of the designated aac for that period 
a tfl is an area based tenure granted for a term of years that is replaced every five years for a further year term  subject to satisfactory performance by the licensee of its forest management obligations as determined by the ministry of forests 
approximately percent of the company s aac in was derived from two tfls tfl and tfl covering million acres of timberland 
tfls are considered the most secure form of timber tenure 
the company s two tfls were both replaced effective march  with year terms 
provincial government timberlands that are not designated as tfls are organized into timber supply areas tsas 
fls are issued within each tsa with the overall harvest for the tsa managed by the ministry of forests on a sustained yield basis 
fls are volume based tenures which authorize a specified volume of timber to be cut within a specific tsa 
fls have a term of years and are generally replaceable every five years for a term of years  subject to satisfactory performance by the licensee of its forest management obligations as determined by the ministry of forests 
the company has one fl located in the boundary tsa that provided approximately percent of the company s aac in the company s fl  covering a total of million acres  was replaced on december  for a year term 
the company is in compliance in all material respects with the terms of its forest tenures 

table of contents a stumpage charge is assessed by the province of british columbia on all government timber that is harvested 
the base stumpage rate charged is determined to meet revenue targets set by the provincial government 
the base rate is adjusted quarterly by the ministry of forests for various factors including recent lumber prices  timber quality  harvesting costs and species mix 
the british columbia government implemented its forest practices code code that became fully effective in mid the code governs all facets of a company s forest management activities from planning through harvesting and forest renewal and provides a uniform set of rules that are designed to better secure the long term sustainability of the forest industry 
the company s harvesting practices are in compliance with the standards set out in the code 
the company was able to retain its aac for its timber tenures while the provincial government s target to double the protected provincial land base from percent to percent was met in the year certain regions of british columbia  including the coastal forest area  will have more than percent of lands in protected status 
the provincial government has reviewed all of the lands containing the company s forest tenures for determination of protected status and no negative impact on timber supply has occurred 
provincial legislation requires the chief forester for british columbia to review sustainable timber harvesting levels in each tfl and tsa in the province every five years 
such determinations involve the company s fl and two tfls 
the annual allowable cut for tfl was increased percent in as a result of the chief forester s timber supply review 
the company s canadian forest operations implemented an environmental management system in and received certification under iso  which is an international standard for environmental systems 
this system offers third party verification that the company is committed to environmental protection of its operating areas  as well as the continual improvement of its performance with regard to the environment 
furthermore  in  the company s canadian forest operations  as the result of a rigorous third party audit  were certified that it is meeting all of the requirements of the american forest paper association s af pa sustainable forestry initiative sfi program 
the standard includes a land stewardship ethic that integrates the managing  growing  nurturing  harvesting and reforesting and replanting of trees with the conservation of soil  air and water quality  wildlife and fish habitat and aesthetics 
support for and conformity to the sfi program is mandatory for af pa member companies 
the company s canadian forest operations are carried out on public forestlands that are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or common law rights of the first nations people of canada 
most of the lands in british columbia are not covered by treaties and  as a result  the claims of british columbia s first nations people relating to these forest resources are largely unresolved 
to address these claims  the governments of canada and british columbia instituted a negotiation process under the administration of a treaty commission 
any settlements that may result from the negotiation process may involve a combination of cash and resources and grants of conditional rights to gather food on public lands and some rights of self government 
the effect of any treaties on timber tenure rights  including the company s timber tenures  cannot be estimated at this time 
such claims may  in the future  result in a decrease in the lands available for forest operations under british columbia licenses  including the company s licenses and contracts  additional restrictions on the sale and harvest of timber on british columbia timberlands  and an increase in operating costs 
such claims could also affect timber supply and prices 
the company believes that such claims will not have a significant effect on the company s timber availability in year  and does not believe there will be significant impacts on timber availability in the near future 
the canadian wood products division operates the midway  castlegar  and grand forks lumber mills in southern british columbia  as well as the arrow lakes and boundary timber forestry divisions 
castlegar is the company s largest sawmill  offering a broad mix of western canadian species in wide widths and lengths up to feet 
the grand forks and midway mills are significant producers of machine stress rated msr lumber 

table of contents the company s spearfish  south dakota sawmill is the largest producer of lumber in south dakota 
the spearfish mill obtains its timber supply from both public and private lands in the black hills region and is also a participant in af pa s sfi program 
the mill produced million board feet of ponderosa pine lumber in of that volume  approximately one half was dimension lumber and the other half premium quality pine boards 
from the lumber  specialty products like exterior log cabin siding and interior paneling were produced 
in addition  a variety of specialized package sizes were available for wholesalers and retailers 
the spearfish sawmill also produces various by products such as wood chips  bark  sawdust and shavings that are sold to other manufacturers 
at the spearfish site  the company also operates the heartland wood pellet facility 
this facility produces wood pellets for wood pellet stoves and had sales of  tons of this renewable heating fuel in canada us trade issues the canada us softwood lumber agreement sla of established volume quotas on canadian softwood lumber shipments to the us based on this agreement  as amended by canada and the united states on august   canadian lumber producers in certain provinces were assigned quotas of lumber volumes that could be shipped to the us tariff free 
incremental volumes were subject to a three tier tariff 
the sla resulted in tariff fees paid to the government of canada or reduced production by increasing down time at the company s british columbia sawmills 
during and  the company expensed tariff charges of approximately million and million  respectively  related to shipments from the company s british columbia sawmills into the us because of the tariffs under the sla  the company took several shutdowns during and on april   the sla expired  and on april   petitions for the imposition of antidumping duties add and countervailing duties cvd on softwood lumber from canada were filed with the us department of commerce doc and the us international trade commission itc by certain us industry and trade groups 
in response to the petitions  the itc conducted a preliminary injury investigation and on may   determined that there was a reasonable indication that the lumber industry in the united states was threatened with material injury by reason of softwood lumber imports from canada 
on august   the doc issued its preliminary determination on the cvd and imposed a preliminary duty rate of percent to be posted by cash deposits or bonds on sales of softwood lumber to the us on or after august  the doc also made a preliminary determination that certain circumstances existed which may result in duties on sales of softwood lumber applying retroactively to may  critical circumstances 
the preliminary duty rate of percent was suspended on december   days after the preliminary determination  in accordance with us law 
the company accrued million for the period from may  to december  for cvd at the preliminarily determined rate of percent 
duties accrued for the retroactive portion of the cvd for the period from may  to august  totaled million 
on october   the doc issued its preliminary determination on the add and imposed a company specific preliminary duty rate on six companies reviewed ranging from percent to percent 
all other companies  including pope talbot s canadian subsidiary  received the weighted average rate of the six companies of percent 
the preliminary add rate applied to all shipments of softwood lumber made to the us on or after november  the doc did not find critical circumstances in its preliminary add ruling and  therefore  did not assess those duties retroactively 
the company accrued million for the period from november  to december  for add at the preliminarily determined average rate of percent 
at december   the company had accrued a total of million for cvd and add 

table of contents on march   the doc announced revised import duty rates of percent and percent  respectively in the cvd and add cases 
the doc also determined that there would be no retroactive application of the cvd prior to august  accordingly  in the first quarter of  the company reversed million of cvd previously accrued for the retroactive assessment period from may  to august  and reversed million of add to reflect the reduction of the add rate to percent 
however  the company accrued add of million on lumber shipments into the united states during the first quarter of  resulting in a net reversal of million of accrued lumber import duties in the first quarter 
on may   the itc issued its final ruling that the u 
s 
softwood lumber industry is threatened with material injury by canadian lumber imports 
based on this ruling  cvd and add rates determined by the doc are due on shipments of canadian lumber into the united states on or after may   but no such duties are due for any shipments before that time 
accordingly  in the second quarter of  the company reversed the remaining million of lumber import duties that were accrued in and the first quarter of based on the doc s preliminary determinations 
on may   the doc finally determined the cvd rate to be percent and the add rate applicable to the company to be percent  resulting in a combined import duty of percent on the company s lumber imports into the united states commencing on may  lumber import duties incurred from may  to december  totaled million 
approximately one year following the publication of the final order  and annually thereafter for a total of five years  the doc will conduct reviews to determine whether canada continued to subsidize softwood logs and whether the canadian companies engaged in dumping and  if so  the appropriate cvd and add rates to impose 
at the end of the five years  both the cvd and add will be automatically reviewed in a sunset proceeding to determine whether dumping or a countervailing subsidy would be likely to continue or recur 
the federal and provincial governments in canada have moved for appellate review by panels under nafta and the world trade organization wto with respect to the cvd findings 
in july  the wto  in a non binding set of recommendations to the us  ruled that the us government erred on several points in its determination of the existence of a subsidy on softwood lumber from canada 
the wto also issued an interim ruling recommending the us government repeal the byrd amendment  which gives us firms cash from punitive trade sanctions applied on foreign imports 
the itc s final ruling is subject to further reviews by panels of the wto and under nafta and  accordingly  it is possible that the lumber import duties may change as a result of such reviews or as a result of a negotiated settlement between the canadian and us governments 
any adjustments to the financial statements resulting from a change in duty rates will be made prospectively 
marketing and distribution in  approximately percent of the company s lumber products were sold to wholesalers  with the remainder sold to remanufacturers and other suppliers of building materials 
wood chips produced by the company s sawmills are sold to manufacturers of pulp in the us and canada 
acquired logs which are not suitable for consumption approximately four percent of logs acquired in were sold to other us and canadian forest products companies 
marketing of the company s wood products is centralized in its portland  oregon office 
although the company does not have distribution facilities at the retail level  the company does utilize several reload facilities around the us to assist in moving the product closer to the customer 
the company sold wood products to numerous customers during  none of which accounted for more than percent of total revenues 

table of contents backlog the company normally maintains four to six weeks of lumber inventory 
at december  orders were approximately million compared with approximately million at december  this backlog represented an order file for the company that generally would be shipped within approximately one month 
competition the wood products industry is highly competitive  with a large number of companies producing products that are reasonably standardized 
there are numerous competitors of the company that are of comparable size or larger  none of which is believed to be dominant 
the principal means of competition in the company s wood products business are pricing and the ability to satisfy customer demands for various types and grades of lumber

environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  provincial and local air  water and land pollution control  solid and hazardous waste management  disposal and remediation laws and regulations in all areas where it has operations 
compliance with these laws and regulations generally requires operating costs as well as capital expenditures 
it is difficult to estimate the costs related solely to environmental matters of many capital projects which have been completed in the past or which may be required in the future 
changes required to comply with environmental standards will affect other areas such as facility life and capacity  production costs  changes in raw material requirements and costs and product value 
the company s estimates of future environmental compliance expenditures are based on its understanding of current standards 
however  the ultimate outcome of future compliance is uncertain due to various factors such as the interpretation of environmental laws  potential introduction of new environmental laws and evolving technologies 
the preservation of old growth forests and wildlife habitat has affected and may continue to affect the amount and cost of timber obtainable from public agencies in oregon and western washington 
the halsey pulp mill has been affected by the decrease in timber availability since its primary raw materials  wood chips and sawdust  are by products of the lumber manufacturing process 
in april  the environmental protection agency epa published regulations establishing standards and limitations for non combustion sources under the clean air act and revised regulations under the clean water act 
these regulations are collectively referred to as the cluster rules 
the company s exposure to these regulations relates to the company s halsey pulp mill 
compliance with certain portions of the cluster rules was required by april   with other portions not required until and the upgrade of the halsey mill  required to comply with the first two portions of the cluster rules  was begun in and completed in november at a total cost of million 
the company spent an additional million in to complete compliance with the portion of the cluster rules and currently estimates the cost of compliance with the portion of the cluster rules that becomes effective in at million 
the epa has also promulgated maximum achievable control technology mact requirements for pulp mill combustion sources which will require installation of modified particulate emission control equipment at the halsey mill by the estimated cost to install this equipment in is million 

table of contents the major environmental issues for pulp producers in british columbia are the management of wastewater  air emissions and solid waste in compliance with an extensive body of applicable environmental protection laws and regulations 
the harmac and mackenzie mills have comprehensive environmental management programs in place  including modern pollution abatement and control technologies  detailed operating procedures and practices  early warning systems  scheduled equipment inspections and emergency response planning 
regular independent audits ensure that the environmental programs are being implemented effectively and that all regulated requirements are being met 
the canadian operations are subject to particulate emission standards determined by the british columbia ministry of water  land and air protection 
the company performed a study in at the mackenzie pulp mill to determine the appropriate control devices and equipment configuration necessary to reduce particulate emissions from the mill s power boiler 
the company expects to complete this project by the second quarter of costs incurred in  primarily for the feasibility study  were million 
the estimated remaining costs are expected to be incurred as follows million and million 
in  the british columbia government amended its regulations that required all pulp mills in british columbia to eliminate the discharge of chlorinated organic compounds by december  under the new regulations the discharge of chlorinated organic compounds will be permitted  but at a lower level than standards currently in effect 
the company s mills in british columbia currently operate well within the new limits  and the company does not anticipate that the new regulations will have any material effect on its business or operations 
however  there remains the possibility that parties opposed to the regulations will challenge them in court  which  if successful  could result in reinstatement of the requirement to eliminate the discharge of all chlorinated organic compounds 
such a result  which the company considers to be highly unlikely  would cause substantially all of the chemical pulp mills in british columbia  including the company s  to shut down  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
legislation in british columbia governing contaminated sites became effective in april if a triggering event occurs in respect of any property that has been used for industrial or commercial purposes  the regulations require  among other things  a site profile to be prepared in order to determine whether the site in question is potentially contaminated  in which case remediation may be required under government supervision 
pulp mills are subject to these regulations  and past and present owners or operators of mill sites may face remediation costs if contaminated areas are found 
triggering events include the sale of the property or the decommissioning of the mill 
the company cannot assess the magnitude of costs it may be required to incur in the future in order to comply with this legislation if a triggering event should occur

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company s management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
the company has identified certain accounting policies  described below  that are the most important to the portrayal of the company s current financial condition and results of operations 
the company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in item note  accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
lumber import duties as discussed previously in item business wood products business  canada us trade issues  the itc s final ruling on lumber import duties is subject to further reviews by panels of the wto and nafta and  accordingly  it is possible that the impact of lumber import duties on the company s results of operations may change as a result of such reviews or as a result of a negotiated settlement between the canadian and us governments 
any adjustments to the amount of duties imposed on the company resulting from a change in duty rates will be made prospectively 
reforestation approximately percent of the company s current lumber capacity is located in the canadian province of british columbia 
the company primarily obtains its timber from the provincial government of british columbia under timber harvesting licenses 
under these licenses  the company is responsible for all reforestation costs such as site preparation  planting  fertilizing  thinning and herbicide application until the harvested land requires no further reforestation activity prior to the next harvest 

table of contents the company estimates reforestation costs based on its substantial experience in reforestation in british columbia under the province s forest practice code 
a significant portion of the reforestation costs occur during the first five years after harvest 
the remaining costs are incurred until the harvested land is free to grow  generally seven to twelve years after initial planting 
beginning in  the company will be required to record the liability for reforestation costs at fair value 
whereas it is possible to reasonably estimate the costs of labor and materials required for reforestation activities  it is not possible to predict the impact of natural disasters  such as windstorms  droughts and forest fires  or the possibility of changes in the province s regulations 
any such event or change could result in an adjustment to the accrual that could  in any given future period  have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review of recoverability  the company estimates future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension plans and postretirement plans for its employees and retains independent actuarial firms to perform actuarial valuations of the fair values of its plans assets and benefit obligations 
the company provides the actuarial firms with certain assumptions that have a significant effect on the fair value of the assets and obligations such as the discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the benefit plans obligations  long term return on assets used to estimate the growth in invested assets available to satisfy certain obligations  salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on pension and other postretirement obligations  and medical cost inflation used to calculate the impact future medical costs will have on postretirement obligations 
these assumptions directly impact the actuarial valuation of the assets and obligations disclosed in the company s financial statements 
the company bases its assumptions on either historical or market data it considers reasonable in the circumstances 
changes in these factors could have a material impact on the estimated cost of the company s employee benefit plans and future cash funding requirements 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company periodically evaluates its tax assets and liabilities and adjusts these balances as appropriate 
it believes that its tax provision is adequate based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law 

table of contents the company believes that it will have sufficient future us taxable income to make it more likely than not that the net operating loss deferred tax asset will be realized 
in making this assessment  the company has considered the cyclical nature of its businesses  the relatively long expiration period of net operating losses and the ability to utilize certain tax planning strategies to generate taxable income if a net operating loss were to otherwise expire 
the realization of the deferred tax asset is not assured and could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
environmental matters the company is required to make estimates of the costs of remediation for certain contaminated former and currently operated mill sites and landfills 
the ultimate costs to the company for the investigation  remediation and monitoring of these sites cannot be predicted with certainty 
the company has recognized liabilities for environmental remediation costs for these sites in amounts that it believes are probable and reasonably estimable 
when one estimate within the range of estimated costs is better than another  the company accrues that amount  otherwise the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
in making these judgments and assumptions  the company considers  among other things  the activity to date at particular sites and information obtained through consultation with applicable regulatory authorities and third party consultants and contractors 
the company regularly monitors its exposure to environmental loss contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change its estimates significantly 
the company has tendered the defense of certain environmental claims to a number of insurance carriers that issued comprehensive general liability policies to the company 
the company has concluded settlements with several insurance carriers and is engaged in settlement discussions with other insurance carriers 
the company believes recovery under these policies is highly probable and has recorded receivables in amounts it has deemed highly probable of realization 
it is possible the company s recorded estimate of insurance recoveries may change 
cautionary language regarding forward looking statements statements in this report that are not reported financial results or other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on present information the company has related to its existing business circumstances and involve a number of business risks and uncertainties  any of which could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements 
further  investors are cautioned that the company does not assume any obligation to update forward looking statements based on unanticipated events or changed expectations 
in addition to specific factors that may be described in connection with any particular forward looking statement  factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include but are not limited to cyclical operating results and product pricing the company s financial performance depends primarily on the prices it receives for its products 
prices for both pulp and lumber products are highly cyclical and have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
increases or decreases in production capacity  increases or decreases in operating rates and changes in customer consumption patterns will cause changes in product prices 
the economic climate of each region where the company s products are sold has a significant impact on the demand  and therefore the prices  for pulp and lumber 
changes in regional economies can cause fluctuation in prices and sales volumes and  as a result  directly affect the company s profitability and cash flows 
the continued uncertainties in the economic conditions of the united states and other international markets could adversely affect the company s results of operations and cash flows 
any future downward fluctuation in prices could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the amount of downtime that the company s mills take fluctuates based on changes in current pricing and demand for its products 

table of contents competitive markets the company s products are sold primarily in the united states  europe  canada and asia 
the markets for the company s products are highly competitive on a global basis  with a number of major companies competing in each market with no company holding a dominant position 
for both lumber and pulp  a large number of companies produce products that are reasonably standardized  therefore  the traditional basis for competition has been price 
other competitive factors are quality of product  reliability of supply and customer service 
because of greater resources  many of the company s competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to industrial changes or devote greater resources to the sale of the products 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to compete successfully against such competitors 
fees on lumber imports into the united states in may  the itc imposed a tariff on certain types of softwood lumber imported into the united states from canada after determining that imports of certain types of softwood lumber from canada threatened us softwood lumber mill operators 
based on findings of the doc regarding subsidies and dumping margins  the itc s decision subjects the company s imports of certain types of softwood lumber from canada on or after may  to a total tariff of percent which has a material adverse effect on the wood products business result of operations 
panels under nafta and the world trade organization wto are reviewing the itc s determination 
however  the outcome or effect of such reviews  or if a settlement between the canadian and us governments may be reached  cannot be predicted 
availability and pricing of raw materials logs  wood chips and sawdust  the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products  are purchased in highly competitive  price sensitive markets 
these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality 
supply and price of these raw materials are dependent upon a variety of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
changes in the pricing of logs under british columbia s current stumpage system as the result of negotiations to resolve the us canada lumber import duty issue could affect the cost of logs for our canadian sawmills 
other factors include changing environmental and conservation regulations and natural disasters  such as forest fires  wind storms or other extreme weather conditions 
a decrease in the supply of logs  wood chips and sawdust can cause higher raw material costs and  as a result  material fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
the company s harmac pulp mill has a long term fiber supply agreement with weyerhaeuser that provides for million cubic meters of fiber per year through the company s mackenzie pulp mill purchases approximately percent of its fiber requirements from sawmills also located in mackenzie  british columbia and operated by slocan 
fiber is purchased at market or at prices determined under a formula intended to reflect market value of the fiber 
the failure by weyerhaeuser or slocan to produce the required fiber pursuant to these contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company as a whole 
the company has entered into arrangements with other independent fiber suppliers to provide fiber incremental to that provided by weyerhaeuser and slocan 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of softwood fiber for its pulp operations 

table of contents british columbia s first nations people s claims to british columbia land the company s canadian forest operations are primarily carried out on public forestlands under forest licenses 
many of these lands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or common law rights of the first nations people of canada 
first nations groups in british columbia have made claims of ownership or interests in substantial portions of land in the province and are seeking compensation from the government with respect to these claims 
the supreme court of canada has held that the first nations groups have a spectrum of aboriginal rights in lands that have been traditionally used or occupied by their ancestors 
the court s decision did not apply to any particular lands and was stated in general terms 
the court held that aboriginal rights and title are not absolute and may be infringed upon by government in furtherance of a legislative objective  including forestry  subject to meeting a justification test and being consistent with the fiduciary relationship between government and first nations groups 
to address the claims of the first nations groups  the governments of canada and british columbia instituted a negotiation process under the administration of a treaty commission 
in july  the voting public approved a referendum of principles for treaty making 
this gave provincial negotiators the authority to negotiate and make commitments on topics that are consistent with the referendum principles and for which current policies exist 
any settlements that may result from the negotiation process may involve a combination of cash and resources and grants of conditional rights to gather food on public lands and some rights of self government 
the effect of any treaties on timber tenure rights  including timber tenures of the company  cannot be estimated at this time 
a reduction in the timber supply could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
environmental regulation the company s pulp and lumber operations are subject to a variety of national and local laws and regulations  many of which deal with the environment 
these laws and regulations impose stringent standards on the company s operations regarding  among other things  air emissions  water discharges  use and handling of hazardous materials  use  handling and disposal of waste and remediation of environmental contamination 
changes in these laws or regulations have in the past  and could in the future  require the company to make substantial expenditures in order to comply  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the british columbia government has recently amended its regulations that had required all pulp mills in british columbia to eliminate the discharge of chlorinated organic compounds by december  the company s mills in british columbia already operate well within the new limits 
however  there remains the possibility that parties opposed to the regulations will challenge them in court  which  if successful  could result in reinstatement of the requirement to eliminate the discharge of all chlorinated organic compounds 
such a result  which the company considers to be highly unlikely  would cause substantially all of the chemical pulp mills in british columbia  including the company s  to shut down  and would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
environmental liabilities the company is currently participating in the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at three sites on which it previously conducted business 
the company has also recently submitted a remediation plan to british columbia environmental authorities for environmental contamination at the mackenzie mill 
in addition  the company was recently notified by the epa that it was considered a potentially responsible party related to a contaminated waste site in whittier  california 
the company has previously provided documentation to the epa that it is not a responsible party with respect to this site 
the company may also be required to investigate and remediate environmental conditions at other sites if contamination  presently unknown to the company  is discovered 
the ultimate cost to the company for site remediation and monitoring of these sites cannot be predicted with certainty due to the difficulties in estimating the ultimate cost of remediation and 
table of contents determining the extent to which contributions will be available from the other parties  including insurance carriers 
expenditures that may be required in connection with these sites could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
exchange rate fluctuations although the company s sales are made primarily in us dollars  a substantial portion of its operating costs and expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
significant variations in relative currency values  particularly a significant increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar  could adversely affect the company s results of operations and cash flows 
a substantial portion of the company s pulp customer base is in europe  asia and other non us markets 
as such  the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies directly affects the company s customers ability to pay and the company s relative competitive cost position with other regions pulps 
any significant exchange rate fluctuation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
net operating loss tax asset management believes that the company will have sufficient future us taxable income to use its net operating loss deferred tax asset 
in making this assessment  management has considered the cyclical nature of its businesses  the relatively long expiration period of net operating losses and the ability to utilize certain tax planning strategies if a net operating loss were to otherwise expire 
the realization of the deferred tax asset is not assured and could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
financial leverage the company s long term debt as a percentage of total capitalization at december  was percent 
while the company s leverage level is not unusual for the forest products and pulp industries  this leverage  or higher leverage if the company were to incur additional indebtedness  could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it difficult to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes 
higher levels of leverage may require a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations to satisfy debt payments  thereby reducing the company s ability to use cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  development projects  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
higher leverage also limits flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in business and increases vulnerability to a downturn in the business and general adverse economic and industry conditions 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial market risk the company s exposure to market risk for interest rates relates primarily to short and long term debt 
the company s investment in marketable securities at december  and was not significant 
the company s debt is primarily fixed rate with only percent of total debt at variable rates and  therefore  net income is not materially affected when market interest rates change 
the company has exposure to foreign currency rate risk due to its significant operations in canada 
for the company  a weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar has a positive effect on the cost of operating in canada but has a negative foreign currency translation effect 
the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar is not hedged 
the net assets in canadian subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates were approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in the canadian to us exchange rate would be approximately million at december  any loss in fair value would be reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and would not reduce reported net income of the company 
the company is exposed to foreign currency transaction gains and losses primarily in the translation of us dollar denominated cash and accounts receivable of its canadian subsidiaries and canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans made by the parent company 
the company periodically uses foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to these foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
the company had no foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  or foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to the results of operations for the company s  or periods 
the company historically has not entered into material currency rate hedges with respect to its exposure from operations 
for example  a change in the canadian to us dollar exchange rate from to would increase pre tax cost of sales by an estimated million us the average canadian to us dollar exchange rate used to translate the results of operations of the company s canadian subsidiaries was  and for  and  respectively 
the company utilizes well defined financial contracts in the normal course of its operations as means to manage commodity price risks  primarily energy purchases 
for those limited number of contracts that are considered derivative instruments  the company formally designates each as a hedge of specific well defined risks 
at december   the company had no derivative contracts outstanding  although the company continued to make forward purchases of natural gas and electricity at fixed prices 
at december   the company had outstanding derivative contracts to manage natural gas price risks with a notional amount of million 
the fair value of these contracts at december  represented an unrealized pre tax loss of million and was recorded in other comprehensive income in all of these contracts expired in
