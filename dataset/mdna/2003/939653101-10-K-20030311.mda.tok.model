risk factors set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our shareholders 
we refer to the shares of beneficial interest in washington real estate investment trust as our shares  and the investors who own shares as our shareholders 
this section includes or refers to certain forward looking statements 
you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on such forward looking statements beginning on page writ s performance and value are subject to risks associated with its real estate assets and with the real estate industry 
writ s economic performance and the value of its real estate assets  and consequently the value of its shares  are subject to the risk that if its office  industrial  multifamily and retail properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet its operating expenses  including debt service and capital expenditures  its cash flow and ability to pay 
table of contents distributions to its shareholders will be adversely affected 
the following factors  among others  may adversely affect the revenues generated by writ s office  industrial  multifamily and retail properties downturns in the national  regional and local economic climate  competition from other office  industrial  multifamily and retail properties  local real estate market conditions  such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office  industrial  multifamily or retail properties  changes in interest rates and availability of financing  vacancies  changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair  renovate and relet space  increased operating costs  including insurance premiums  utilities and real estate taxes  civil disturbances  earthquakes and other natural disasters  or terrorist acts or acts of war may result in uninsured or underinsured losses  significant expenditures associated with each investment  such as debt service payments  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property  and ability to collect rents from tenants 
writ is dependent upon the economic climate of the greater washington  dc region 
all of writ s properties are located in the greater washington baltimore region as compared to a geographically diverse portfolio 
general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in this geographic region have a particularly strong effect on the trust 
writ faces risks associated with property acquisitions 
writ intends to continue to acquire properties that could continue to increase its size and alter the capital structure 
writ s acquisition activities and its success may be exposed to the following risks writ may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors  including publicly traded real estate investment trusts  institutional investment funds and private investors  even if writ enters into an acquisition agreement for a property  it is subject to customary conditions to closing  including completion of due diligence investigations which may be unacceptable  even if writ is able to acquire a desired property  competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price  writ may be unable to finance acquisitions on favorable terms  acquired properties may fail to perform as writ expected in analyzing its investments  and writ s estimates of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be inaccurate 
writ may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without recourse  or with limited recourse  with respect to unknown liabilities 
as a result  if liability were asserted against writ based upon those properties  writ may have to pay substantial sums to settle it  which could adversely affect its cash flow 
unknown liabilities with respect to properties acquired might include liabilities for clean up of undisclosed environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business  and claims for indemnification by general partners  directors  officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 
writ will face new and different risks associated with property development 
the ground up development of writ rosslyn center  as opposed to renovation and redevelopment of an existing property  is a new activity for writ 
developing a property  in addition to the risks historically associated with writ s business  presents a number of new and additional risks for writ  including risks that 
table of contents the development opportunity may be abandoned after expending significant resources  if writ is unable to obtain all necessary zoning and other required governmental permits and authorizations  the development and construction costs of the project may exceed original estimates  construction and or permanent financing may not be available on favorable terms or may not be available at all  the project may not be completed on schedule as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond writ s control  such as weather  labor conditions and material shortages  which would result in increases in construction costs and debt service expenses  and occupancy rates and rents at the newly completed property may not meet the expected levels and could be insufficient to make the property profitable 
properties developed or acquired for development may generate little or no cash flow from the date of acquisition through the date of completion of development 
in addition  new development activities  regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful  may require a substantial portion of management s time and attention 
writ faces potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re leasing space 
writ derives most of its income from rent received from tenants 
if a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress  it may be unable to make timely rental payments 
also  when writ s tenants decide not to renew their lease writ may not be able to relet the space 
if tenants decide to renew its lease  the terms of renewals  including the cost of required improvements or concessions  may be less favorable than current lease terms 
as a result  writ s cash flow could decrease and its ability to make distributions to its shareholders could be adversely affected 
writ faces potential adverse effects from major tenants bankruptcies or insolvencies 
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by a property 
although writ has not experienced material losses from tenant bankruptcies or insolvencies in the past  a major tenant could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future 
writ cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy 
on the other hand  a court might authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with writ 
in such case  writ s claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid  future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease  and  even so  writ s claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full 
this shortfall could adversely affect writ s cash flow and results from operations 
writ s properties face significant competition 
writ faces significant competition from developers  owners and operators of office  industrial  multi family  retail and other commercial real estate 
substantially all of its properties face competition from similar properties in the same market 
such competition may affect writ s ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents writ is able to charge 
these competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than writ s properties  which may result in their owners being willing to make space available at lower prices than the space in writ s properties 
compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act and other laws could result in substantial costs 
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that public buildings  including office  industrial  retail and multi family properties  be made accessible to disabled persons 
noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants 
if  pursuant to the americans with disabilities act  writ is required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of its properties  including the removal of access barriers  it could adversely affect writ s financial condition and results of operations  as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to its shareholders 
writ may also incur significant costs complying with other regulations 
writ properties are subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements  such as state and local fire and life safety requirements 
if writ fails to comply with these requirements  it may incur fines or private damage awards 
writ believes that its properties are currently in material compliance with all of these regulatory requirements 
however  writ does not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will adversely affect writ s cash flow and results from operations 
some potential losses are not covered by insurance 
writ carries insurance coverage on its properties of types and in amounts that it believes are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties 
writ believes all of its properties are adequately insured 
the property insurance that writ maintains for its properties has historically been on an all risk basis  including losses caused by acts of terrorism 
writ s all risk insurance coverage  which is in full force and effect until renewal in september  has not been modified and includes coverage for losses attributable to acts of terrorism 
there are other types of losses  such as from wars or catastrophic acts of nature  for which writ cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost 
in the event of an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of its insurance limits  writ could lose both the revenues generated from the affected property and the capital writ has invested in the affected property 
depending on the specific circumstances of the affected property it is possible that writ could be liable for any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property 
any such loss could adversely affect writ s business and financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 
under federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  writ may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at its properties  regardless of writ s knowledge or responsibility  simply because of writ s current or past ownership or operation of the real estate 
if unidentified environmental problems arise  writ may have to make substantial payments which could adversely affect its cash flow and its ability to make distributions to its shareholders because as owner or operator writ may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination  the law typically imposes clean up responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination  even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination  each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs  and governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs 
writ has a storage tank third party liability policy in place to cover potential hazardous releases from underground storage tanks on its properties 
this insurance is in place to mitigate any potential remediation costs from the effect of releases of hazardous or toxic substances from these storage tanks 
these costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the value of the contaminated property 
the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  petroleum products  or the failure to properly remediate contamination may adversely affect writ s ability to borrow against  sell or rent an affected property 
in addition  applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with a contamination 
environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of asbestos 
such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos  notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos  and undertake special precautions  including removal or other abatement  if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
it is writ s policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct phase i environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to its acquisition of properties 
these assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas  an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state  federal and historical documents  but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling 
where appropriate  on a property by property basis  writ s practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing  including sampling for asbestos  for mold  for lead in drinking water  for soil contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usages create a potential environmental problem  and for contamination in groundwater 
even though these environmental assessments are conducted  there is still the risk that the environmental assessments and updates did not identify all potential environmental liabilities  a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to writ or the independent consultants preparing the assessments  new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted  and future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability to writ 

table of contents writ faces risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments  including refinancing risk 
writ is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that its cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest 
writ anticipates that only a small portion of the principal of its debt will be repaid prior to maturity 
therefore  writ is likely to need to refinance at least a portion of its outstanding debt as it matures 
there is a risk that writ may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt 
if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources  such as new equity capital  writ s cash flow will not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due 
rising interest rates would increase writ s interest costs 
writ may incur indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  if interest rates increase  so will writ s interest costs  which could adversely affect writ s cash flow  its ability to service debt and its ability to make distributions to shareholders 
as a protection against rising interest rates  writ may enter into agreements such as interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
these agreements  however  increase writ s risks including other parties to the agreements not performing or that the agreements may be unenforceable 
covenants in writ s debt agreements could adversely affect its financial condition 
writ relies on borrowings under its credit facilities to finance acquisitions and development activities and for working capital 
if writ were unable to borrow under its credit facilities  or to refinance existing indebtedness  writ s financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected 
writ s credit facilities contain customary restrictions  requirements and other limitations on its ability to incur indebtedness 
writ must maintain certain ratios  including total debt to assets  secured debt to total asset  debt service coverage and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt 
writ s ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with its financial and other covenants 
further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current shareholders 
the interests of writ s existing shareholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments and acquisitions instead of incurring additional debt 
writ s ability to execute its business strategy depends on its access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt  and equity financing 
failure to qualify as a reit would cause writ to be taxed as a corporation  which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends 
if writ fails to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  it would be taxed as a corporation 
writ believes that the trust is organized and qualified as a reit  and intends to operate in a manner that will allow it to continue to qualify as a reit 
if writ fails to qualify as a reit it could face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because writ would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing its taxable income and could be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates  writ also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes  unless writ is entitled to relief under statutory provisions  it could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which it is disqualified  and 
table of contents all dividends will be subject to tax as ordinary income to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits 
in addition  if writ fails to qualify as a reit  it would no longer be required to pay dividends 
as a result of these factors  writ s failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital  and could adversely affect the value of its shares 
changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of its shares 
as with other publicly traded equity securities  the value of writ s shares depends on various market conditions which may change from time to time 
among the market conditions that may affect the value of writ s shares are the following the extent of investor interest in writ  the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities  including securities issued by other real estate based companies  writ s financial performance  and general stock and bond market conditions

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations writ s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon writ s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires writ to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  writ evaluates these estimates  including those related to estimated useful lives of real estate assets  cost reimbursement income  bad debts  contingencies and litigation 
writ bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies writ believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
writ s significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
revenue recognition writ s revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component of the company s results from operations 
in addition  revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as leasing commissions and bad debt 
writ recognizes real estate rental revenue including cost reimbursement income when earned in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
this requires writ to recognize rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the company s leases 
writ maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company s tenants to make required payments 
capital expenditures writ capitalizes those expenditures related to acquiring new assets  significantly increasing the value of an existing asset  or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset 
expenditures necessary to maintain an existing property in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 
estimated useful lives of real estate assets real estate assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
all capital improvement expenditures associated with replacements  improvements  or major repairs to real property are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
all tenant improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life or the term of the lease 
impairment losses on long lived assets writ recognizes impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the net undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
if such carrying amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flows of the property  writ would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to the estimated fair market value 
there were no property impairments recognized during the three year period ending december  
table of contents federal income taxes writ has qualified as a real estate investment trust reit under sections of the internal revenue code and intends to continue to qualify as such 
to maintain its status as a reit  the company is required to distribute of its ordinary taxable income for years prior to to its shareholders 
the company has the option of i reinvesting the sale price of properties sold  allowing for a deferral of income taxes on the sale  ii paying out capital gains to the shareholders with no tax to the company or iii treating the capital gains as having been distributed to the shareholders  paying the tax on the gain deemed distributed and allocating the tax paid as a credit to the shareholders 
the company distributed all of its   and ordinary taxable income to its shareholders 
gain on sale of properties disposed during  and were reinvested in replacement properties  therefore no capital gains were distributed to shareholders during these periods 
accordingly  no provision for income taxes was necessary
