item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
operating environment and recent developments our operating results depend in large measure on oil and gas drilling activity levels in the markets we serve  as well as on the depth of drilling  which governs the revenue potential of each well 
these levels  in turn  depend on oil and gas commodities pricing  inventory levels and product demand 
rig count data is the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity 
key average rig count data for the last five years is listed in the following table us rig count newpark s primary gulf coast market newpark s primary market to total canadian rig count source baker hughes incorporated our primary gulf coast market  which accounted for approximately of revenues  includes south louisiana land  texas railroad commission districts and  louisiana and texas inland waters  and offshore gulf of mexico 
the canadian market accounted for approximately of revenues 
much of the terrain throughout the oil and gas producing region of canada presents soil stability and access problems similar to those encountered in the marsh areas of the us gulf coast region 
much of the drilling activity in canada has historically been conducted when winter temperatures freeze the soil and stabilize it  allowing safe access 
quarterly fluctuations in the canadian rig count generally reflect the seasonal nature of drilling activity related to these access issues 
natural gas production accounts for the majority of activity in the markets that we serve 
gas storage levels and demand for natural gas have a significant impact on gas pricing  which  in turn  affects drilling activity  as gas suppliers need to maintain adequate storage for peak demand levels and insure adequate supplies for anticipated future demand 
rising commodity prices moderated the demand for natural gas beginning in the second half of  as some commercial users switched to less costly alternate fuel sources when possible 
this moderating demand  which was due to both high gas prices and declining economic activity  resulted in record high levels of gas storage during and contributed to a decline in commodity prices and exploration activity 
significant declines in exploration activity began in the fourth quarter of and continued into the second quarter of  which we believe was the bottom of the downward cycle 
gas storage contracted from the first quarter of to the first quarter of a slight increase in rig activity began in the third quarter of  but no significant increase in rig activity is expected through mid the average us rig count declined during to  as compared to there has been a slight increase in the us rig count since the low point experienced in mid  
table of contents although the increase in our primary gulf coast market has been less pronounced 
according to baker hughes inc  as of the week ended march   the us rig count was  with rigs within our primary gulf coast market 
in  the traditional surge in canadian activity during the winter season was not as significant as in recent years as a result of higher gas storage levels and uncertainty on the outlook for future gas prices 
canadian rig activity in averaged rigs  below the comparable period in the increase in canadian activity has been much greater in the early part of  as compared to according to baker hughes  inc  as of the week ended march   the canadian rig count was all of our gulf coast business units were negatively affected in the third and fourth quarter of by two named tropical systems and several tropical depressions in the gulf of mexico 
the infrastructure damage sustained from these storms also delayed operations in the first quarter of we continue to develop a niche in the drilling fluids market based upon our proprietary deepdrill technology 
during  we achieved drilling successes with deepdrill  and that track record is beginning to translate into new commitments for upcoming projects 
recently  we successfully completed projects for two major international oil companies using the deepdrill system  and several other major companies are currently testing the system 
our recent acquisition of ava spa provides new market opportunities in the mediterranean  eastern europe and north africa 
while this acquisition will initially concentrate on the drilling fluids market  we believe that most of our product offerings have applications in these markets  and we expect to develop these market opportunities in the future 
new environmental protection agency regulations that limit the discharge of synthetic oil based drilling fluids into the gulf of mexico became effective on august   and  excluding the impact of adverse weather  we began to see the positive impact of these regulations on our waste disposal operations 
we believe that the new regulations could also increase the demand for our deepdrill family of drilling fluid products 
while sales of our new dura base composite mat system were lower than in  we have begun to penetrate non oilfield markets and foreign markets with this product and recognized our first significant shipment of this product for use by the us military in the fourth quarter of since the introduction of the dura base composite mat system  we have identified and begun to develop eight key markets  including canada  alaska and the arctic  russia  the middle east  south america  mexico  indonesia and the us utilities markets 
we now have completed sales in seven of these eight key markets 
in addition  we completed the first shipment of our new lightweight dura base sp mat in this new mat system has been designed specifically for non mechanized applications by the us military  including walkways and tent flooring  but is likely to have many other applications 
the mat rental market in our traditional gulf coast oilfield market was depressed during  declining more than from the prior year 
the activity in this market  which historically is a leading indicator of drilling activity in this region  began to improve late in the fourth quarter and has maintained this momentum to date in pricing has recovered by more than from levels and is expected to remain stable 
total industry mat inventories are down from the peak in  which should help improve pricing and utilization of the rental fleet in the 
table of contents coming market cycle 
in addition  the overall condition of our competitors inventory is deteriorating  and their usable inventory is at historic low levels 
our inventory is in very good condition and investment returns should recover to historic levels as the market improves 
we have also increased our marketing efforts for rental services to other non oilfield markets  such as electric utility construction  and believe that there are many opportunities  especially along the gulf coast 
other market trends current short term industry forecasts suggest that we should continue to see a slight increase in the number of rigs active in our primary gulf coast market  but this increase is expected to develop slowly and accelerate in the second half of we anticipate continued market penetration of critical  deep water and geologically deeper wells with our deepdrill family of products  which should help to provide additional revenue growth as the market recovers 
we believe that canadian drilling activity will continue to improve in the first quarter of current long term industry forecasts reflect a stable to growing demand for natural gas  predicated upon improving economic conditions 
in addition  current productive gas reserves are being depleted at a rate faster than current replacement through drilling activities 
because many shallow fields in the gulf coast market have been heavily exploited  and because of improved economics  producers are increasing drilling depth to reach the larger gas reserves 
we expect gas drilling activity to be increasingly associated with deeper  more costly wells 
we view this trend as favorable with respect to demand for product offerings in all of our segments 
results of operations summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown below in the following table dollars in thousands years ended december  vs 
vs 
revenues by segment e p waste disposal fluids sales engineering mat integrated services total operating income by segment e p waste disposal fluids sales engineering mat integrated services total by segment general and administrative expenses goodwill amortization total operating income figures shown above are net of intersegment transfers 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas  among other requirements  i provides that goodwill not be amortized in any circumstance  and ii requires that goodwill be tested for impairment based on a fair value concept 
we completed our fair value testing of goodwill 
table of contents balances during the quarter ended march  and determined that our existing goodwill balances were not impaired under the new standards 
upon adoption of fas on january   we ceased to amortize our remaining goodwill balance 
goodwill amortization was approximately million  or million net of tax  for the year ended december   and million  or million net of tax  for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues e p waste disposal waste disposal revenue declined million  or  on a decline in waste volumes received 
during  we received million barrels of e p waste  compared to million barrels in this decline in waste volumes received is due primarily to the decline in average rigs 
the average revenue per barrel increased to in  as compared to an average of in  as a result of favorable changes in the mix of waste streams received  with an increasing proportion of the waste coming from the offshore market in response to regulatory changes 
as noted earlier  the second half of results were impacted by adverse tropical weather 
in spite of these weather effects  the decline in receipts during the second half of as compared to the comparable period in was only  significantly less than the decline in active rigs in our primary market during this period 
we believe this is an indication of the impact of the new discharge limitations on synthetic based fluids that recently became fully effective 
in the third quarter of we opened a new facility at galveston  texas that immediately began to receive waste from customers in that area 
we now operate seven facilities along the gulf of mexico to receive and process e p waste 
nonhazardous industrial waste disposal revenues were approximately million in  as compared to million in  an increase of 
norm revenues were approximately million in  as compared to million in  a decrease of 
fluids sales and engineering revenues for this segment declined million  or  to million for  as compared to the average number of rigs we serviced declined by  from in to in the revenue decline was significantly less than the decline in the number of rigs serviced  as we continued to benefit from our focus on deeper drilling projects in key markets 
as a result of this trend  the average annual revenue per rig increased to approximately million in  as compared to approximately million in the increased revenue generation per rig is due principally to increasing market participation in the us gulf of mexico market  and the improving quality depth of drilling and difficulty of drilling of work assigned to us by our customers 
on may   we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of ava  spa  a year old company that provides drilling fluids and related products to exploration companies in the mediterranean  eastern europe and north africa 
results of operations for ava subsequent to the effective date of the acquisition provided million in revenues during we have begun to see indications that key gulf of mexico projects delayed from are restarting  and this should have positive implications for in addition  we expect an increase in drilling fluid revenue in the canadian market in the first quarter of due to the normal 
table of contents seasonal improvement in canadian activity 
the new synthetic based fluid regulations could also accelerate the acceptance of our deepdrill family of products  since discharge of these products would be exempt from the new regulations  thus reducing the disposal costs of our customers 
these new regulations have helped us to open discussions about our drilling fluids products  services and capabilities with many operators who are not currently drilling fluids customers 
we anticipate that drilling fluid revenue will lead our revenue growth in  assuming improvement in drilling activity 
mat and integrated services mat revenue for was million  compared to million in  a decline of 
pricing of mats rented in the core gulf coast market declined substantially compared to a year ago due to reduced drilling activity in this market during average rental pricing for this market declined to per square foot in from per square foot in the volume of re rentals ie revenues related to our customer s extention of agreements beyond the initial contractual period  the most profitable revenues for this segment  declined during  as compared to  also as a result of reduced activity 
the highly competitive pricing in the gulf coast mat rental market experienced in began to subside in the fourth quarter as a result of increased activity and lower mat inventories 
during  we sold approximately  composite mats  resulting in million in revenues  as compared to million of revenue on approximately  mats sold in we have furnished price quotations for sales of composite mats on several large projects outside our primary north american oil service market and expect that these projects will be the source of increasing composite mat sales revenue in with improvement in commodity pricing  we anticipate that canadian composite mat sales will increase again in operating income e p waste disposal operating income for this segment declined million on a million decline in revenues 
in late  we began to reduce costs in this segment in response to reduced market activities as further discussed below 
these cost reductions were fully in place by june  and were slightly offset by the costs associated with opening our new galveston facility and expanding two key service facilities 
the cost reductions included  among other things  our decision not to exercise our option to renew a disposal agreement with us liquids usl beyond the most recent expiration date of june  in december  in anticipation of increased volumes of waste streams resulting from the recently enacted discharge regulations for synthetic fluids  we had exercised our option to dispose of e p waste at certain of usl s disposal facilities for a period of one year from july  as part of this original option exercise  we doubled the amount of waste volume that we could dispose of at these facilities and obtained usl s agreement not to compete with us in the e p disposal business through june  our disposal cost under this contract was approximately per barrel higher than under the disposal agreement that expired on june  due to the decline in total waste volume resulting from lower rig activity  we did not exercise our option to extend the agreement beyond the june  expiration date 
accordingly  as of that date we were relieved of any future obligation to usl  and usl was released from any non competition restrictions 
with completion of our cost reduction strategy and the termination of the usl agreement  operating margins for this segment have improved significantly beginning in the third quarter of 
table of contents fluids sales and engineering operating income from fluids sales and engineering declined million  or  in as compared to operating margins for this segment declined from in to in this decline in operating income and operating margin is due in part to lower revenues in  our internal operating leverage and the mix of product sales 
the operating leverage of this segment was impacted in by our decision to increase our technical staffing during the downturn 
this decision was made in anticipation of an improving market and expansion of our customer base 
as a result of this decision  along with the ava acquisition  operating costs for this segment increased during  in spite of the decline in revenues 
the gross margin for this segment was in  as compared to in revenues in reflected an increase in sales of our higher margin proprietary products  including our deepdrill family of products 
the increase in percentage of these higher margin product revenues was partially offset by an increase in lower margin revenue from the mediterranean and north african markets associated with the acquisition of ava 
we expect to realize the benefits of our higher margin  proprietary products such as deepdrill as these products gain wider customer acceptance 
in addition  we expect to see margin improvement as we continue to penetrate the offshore gulf of mexico market  as sales in this market typically earn higher margins 
mat and integrated services mat and integrated services operating income declined million in as compared to  on a million decline in revenues 
the large decline in operating income is primarily due to two factors 
first  we experienced lower rental income in our primary oilfield rental business due to a reduction in pricing from to per square foot installed and a significant reduction in re rental income of million  or 
second  we experienced lower composite mat sales in composite mat sales generated a gross margin contribution of approximately in in december  we converted approximately million of remaining obligations under operating leases for certain equipment to a capital lease 
this conversion was made to reduce operating costs  reduce the interest rates charged and extend the payment terms 
this conversion reduced operating costs in by approximately million and helped to partially offset the effects of the revenue declines noted above 
interest income and interest expense net interest expense was million for  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million for the decrease in net interest cost is principally due to the interest rate swap arrangement entered into in november and settled on july  the total benefit from this arrangement  recognized entirely in  was million 
in addition to the swap arrangement  interest expense was lower in compared to the prior year due to a decrease of million in average outstanding borrowings and a decline in the average effective interest rate from in to in  exclusive of the effect of the swap 
the decrease in the effective interest rate resulted from the general decline in interest rates experienced during and  which were partially offset by higher pricing spreads on our credit facility due to lower earnings and the corresponding reduction in our debt coverage ratios 

table of contents provision for income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million in and million in this equates to of pre tax income in and of pre tax income in the higher effective tax rate in results from certain non deductible business expenses in relation to low pretax income 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues e p waste disposal the million  or  increase in waste disposal revenue  which occurred during the first three quarters of  is associated with both an increase in waste volume in the e p markets and increases in the average revenue per barrel 
we received  barrels of waste in  compared to  barrels in  a increase 
the average revenue per barrel increased to per barrel in  compared to per barrel in the small increase in barrels received as compared to a increase in the average number of rigs in our primary gulf coast market during reflects the entrance of several competitors into the e p waste disposal market 
during  our market share declined by to a total of approximately of the market 
this market penetration from new competition substantially subsided by the end of nonhazardous industrial waste disposal revenues remained relatively unchanged at million in  as compared to million in norm revenues were approximately million in as compared to million in  an increase of 
fluids sales and engineering the fluids sales and engineering revenue increase of million  or  was principally the result of continued market share penetration 
the average number of rigs we serviced increased by  from in to in the average annual revenue per rig was approximately  in  compared to  in  an increase of 
this increase in average revenue per rig serviced reflects an increase in the number of deeper  more complicated drilling projects that we serviced 
we expanded our penetration of the deep water and onshore deep well markets primarily through the continued success of our deepdrill family of products and our performance services product offerings 
mat and integrated services the million  or  increase in mat and integrated services revenues is due primarily to increased composite mat sales and secondarily to increased drilling activity along the us onshore gulf coast  which favorably impacted pricing for our mat systems 
during  we sold approximately  composite mats  generating million in revenues  compared to composite mat sales of million in sales of composite mats into the canadian oilfield market accounted for of total composite mat sales 
in anticipation of lower composite mat sales in  we reduced the production of composite mats in to  units 
rental pricing in for mats in our gulf coast market improved to an average of per square foot on million square feet of mats installed  compared with per square foot on million square feet of mats installed in mat installations in were more heavily concentrated in the louisiana wetlands market  which receives premium pricing due to the size 
table of contents and complexity of the site installations in this market 
during  the trend towards deeper  more complex drilling in the onshore gulf coast market was evidenced by the increase in re rental revenues ie revenues which extend beyond the initial contractual period  the most profitable revenues for this segment 
re rental revenue increased to million during from million for  nearly a threefold increase 
the increase in re rental income was a result of increases in well depth 
operating income e p waste disposal the million decrease in waste disposal operating income in spite of an increase in revenues was due in part to increases in operating costs as a result of the extension of the usl contract discussed above 
in addition  certain operating costs increased in due to our attempts to accommodate certain customer requests to segregate their waste streams at collection facilities 
this request for segregation resulted in duplicate costs for transportation and handling in this segment also experienced increases in certain operating costs  including barge rental costs  repairs and maintenance and trucking costs in this segment also incurred additional costs in in connection with the expansion of our facilities at the port of fourchon in preparation for anticipated increases in waste volumes resulting from new offshore discharge regulations for synthetic based fluids 
we developed a plan to mitigate these cost increases and to resize our fixed cost structure in light of the increased competition experienced during we began to implement this plan in the third quarter of and implementation of this plan was completed by the end of the second quarter of this plan included reducing transportation costs through improved efficiency in barge utilization and renegotiated trucking contracts 
in addition  we worked with our customers to eliminate requests for segregation of waste 
fluids sales and engineering the million increase in fluids sales and engineering operating income is due primarily to an increase in revenue of million and represents an incremental margin of 
operating margins for this segment improved from in to in the operating margin of this segment is affected by the mix of products sold 
there is a significant difference in the gross margins recognized on commodity products and those recognized for specialty products 
mat and integrated services mat and integrated services operating income increased million on a million increase in revenues  representing an incremental margin of 
the high incremental margin reflects the increase in composite mat sales  which typically generate a gross margin of approximately 
in addition  this incremental margin reflects the increase in the amount of high margin re rental business in as compared to resulting from the significant increase in transition zone projects in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses of million for represented of revenues 
general and administrative expenses of million for represented of revenues 
the increase in is associated with increased personnel costs  including bonus accruals  certain costs related to the renewal of our credit facility and increases in insurance costs 

table of contents interest income and interest expense net interest expense was million for  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million for the decrease in net interest cost is primarily due to a decrease of million in average outstanding borrowings and a decrease in the average effective interest rate from in to in partially offsetting these benefits was a decrease in interest capitalization from  in to  in the decrease in average outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility was principally due to applying proceeds received in late december from a million preferred stock private placement 
provision for income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million in and million in this equates to of pre tax income in and of pre tax income in liquidity and capital resources our working capital position was as follows as of december working capital s current ratio during the year ended december   our working capital position increased by million  as compared to this increase in working capital was principally due to increases in composite mat inventory and drilling fluids raw materials and component inventory 
the increase in drilling fluids raw materials and components is related to the expected increase in drilling activity in we have reduced our planned delivery of composite mats in to  units 
with this decline in deliveries  along with anticipated composite mat sales in  we expect to reduce the level of composite mat inventory by the end of we also experienced an increase in accounts receivable in spite of the decline in revenues during this increase in receivables is primarily attributable to the acquisition of ava  which has a longer receivable payment cycle from its national oil company customers 
we are monitoring our accounts receivable positions and do not anticipate any further deterioration in our collection cycles in in january  we acquired the entire raw barite inventory which had previously been held on a consignment basis 
the purchase  which totaled approximately million  was made at a discount from our standard contract prices and was principally funded through a million advance on our revolving credit facility 
this purchase was made because our supplier was exiting the wholesale barite business 
while this purchase will initially result in an increase in working capital  we expect to reduce this inventory level over the course of our new supplier of raw barite has agreed to supply us on a consignment basis 
we anticipate that our working capital requirements for will increase as a result of the expected improvement in revenue  related in part to modest gains in rig activity 
if market conditions improve in the second half of as anticipated  we will likely have to supplement our operating cash flows with borrowings under our credit facility to fund the resulting increase in working capital 
recent reductions in the outstanding balance of our credit facility have provided us with access to readily available capital resources for the anticipated upward cycle in industry activity 

table of contents cash generated from operations during totaled million and was used principally to fund net capital expenditures of million 
we estimate that capital expenditures will be approximately million in  with approximately million used to relocate our primary barite grinding facilities and million for maintenance capital 
the remaining amount is expected to be used principally to expand drilling fluids service capacity 
our commitments to expand drilling fluids capacity will be monitored and adjusted depending on market conditions 
we expect to fund capital expenditures with cash generated from operations 
our long term capitalization was as follows as of december long term debt excluding current maturities credit facility senior subordinated notes other total long term debt stockholders equity total capitalization long term debt to long term capitalization effective january   we completed the re syndication of our million bank credit facility  expanding the participants to six banks from four  and extending the term through february the compliance ratios were simplified and minor technical changes were implemented to simplify the documentation 
since the re syndication  several amendments to the credit facility have been obtained to adjust the compliance ratios as a result of the current market cycle 
at december   million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the facility  and million was outstanding under the revolving facility  leaving million of availability under this facility at december  as noted above  in january  we used million of our availability under the credit facility to fund the purchase of raw barite inventory 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations will provide the majority of our cash needs and that the availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital funding needs in any cyclical recovery 
the credit facility bears interest at either a specified prime rate at december  or the libor rate at december   in each case plus a spread determined quarterly based on the ratio of our funded debt to cash flow 
the weighted average interest rates on the outstanding balance under the credit facility was in  in and in the credit facility contains certain financial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit facility 
our senior subordinated notes do not contain any financial covenants 
however  if we do not meet the financial covenants of the bank credit facility and are unable to obtain an amendment from the banks  we would be in default under the terms of the credit facility and the notes would be in default and would be immediately due 
the notes  the bank credit facility and the certificates of designation relating to 
table of contents our preferred stock also contain covenants that significantly limit the payment of dividends on our common stock 
as discussed above  in may  we acquired the common stock of ava 
the consideration included cash of approximately million and  shares of our common stock 
in addition to the initial investment  we have made advances totaling million to recapitalize ava and provide it with the capital structure to allow for borrowings to meet its working capital requirements 
we borrowed the cash to fund the acquisition and subsequent advances by a draw on our credit facility 
ava maintains its own credit arrangements  consisting primarily of lines of credit with several banks that are renewed on an annual basis 
advances under these credit arrangements are typically based on a percentage of ava s accounts receivable or firm contracts with certain customers 
as of december   ava had a total of million in bank commitments  of which million was outstanding  leaving million of availability under these facilities 
we do not provide a corporate guaranty of ava s debt 
the average interest rate on these credit arrangements as of december  was 
we believe that these credit arrangements  along with ava s ability to obtain increases in the underlying commitments as needs dictate  are sufficient to support the anticipated growth in ava s business without additional support from our corporate group 
with respect to off balance sheet liabilities  we lease most of our office and warehouse space  rolling stock and certain pieces of operating equipment under operating leases 
in addition  as discussed below in item a  during we entered into a limited duration interest rate swap arrangement 
this arrangement was terminated in july we have issued a guaranty of certain debt obligations of the manufacturer of our composite mats 
this guaranty is backed by a letter of credit 
the amount of this guaranty as of december  was million 
the underlying debt obligation of the manufacturer matures in approximately six years  and current sales of composite mats are generating sufficient cash flows to support this debt  which is amortizing on schedule 
we have also issued a guaranty for certain debt obligations of a joint venture which supplies a portion of our wooden mats on a day rate leasing basis 
the amount of this guaranty as of december  was million 
except as described in the preceding paragraphs  we are not aware of any material expenditures  significant balloon payments or other payments on long term obligations or any other demands or commitments  including off balance sheet items to be incurred within the next months 
inflation has not materially impacted our revenues or income 
a summary of our outstanding contractual obligations at december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases total contractual obligations standby letters of credit 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  which requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments related to uncollectible accounts and notes receivable  inventory  customer returns  impairments of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles and our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
note a to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
we believe the critical accounting policies described below affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition for the fluids sales and engineering segment  revenues are recognized for sales of drilling fluid materials upon shipment of the materials  less an allowance for product returns 
engineering and related services are provided to customers at agreed upon hourly or daily rates and are recognized when the services are performed 
the reserve for estimated product returns is based on our historical experience of the percentage of returns  which in turn is based on the size and type of rig serviced and the nature of the products consumed by the customer 
these percentages are periodically reviewed and updated and are applied to our drilling fluids product sales to determine the required reserve 
revisions to the return reserve are charged or credited to income in the period in which they occur 
for the e p waste disposal segment  revenues are recognized when we take title to the waste  which is upon its receipt 
for the mat and integrated services segment  revenues are recognized on both fixed price and unit priced contracts  which are short term in duration  on the percentage of completion method as measured using specific units delivered or project milestones completed 
this method is used because we believe it reflects the level of effort expended by us in proportion to the total effort required to complete the contract 
revenues for services provided to customers at agreed upon hourly or daily rates are recognized when the services are performed 
revenues for sales of composite mats are recognized when title passes to the customer 
for our performance service products  which incorporate two or more product offerings  we recognize revenues on the percentage of completion method as measured based upon the time and materials expended to date as a percentage of total estimated time and materials to be provided under the contract 
for revenues recognized on the percentage of completion basis  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which these losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
profit incentives are included in revenues when their realization is reasonably assured 
an amount 
table of contents equal to contract costs attributable to claims is included in revenues when realization is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated 
allowance for doubtful accounts reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and notes receivable are determined on a specific identification basis when we believe that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is not probable 
for notes receivable  our judgments with respect to collectibility includes evaluating any underlying collateral 
the majority of our revenues are from mid sized and international oil companies and government owned or government controlled oil companies  and we have receivables in several foreign jurisdictions 
changes in oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions could cause our customers to be unable to repay these receivables  resulting in additional allowances 
inventory reserves for inventory obsolescence are determined based on our historical usage of inventory on hand as well as our future expectations related to our customers needs  market conditions and the development of new products 
we have recently developed several new products  including our deepdrill family of products and our dura base composite plastic mat system 
our inability to obtain market acceptance of these products  changes in oil and gas drilling activity and the development of new technologies associated with the drilling industry could require additional allowances to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of its cost or net realizable value 
asset impairments we perform goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests on at least an annual basis in accordance with the guidance in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
we perform long lived asset impairment tests in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas 
in accordance with fas  impairments are calculated based on a fair value concept 
in accordance with fas  impairments are calculated based on a future cash flow concept 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the market value of assets  
table of contents significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and in our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based on one or more of the above indicators  any impairment is calculated in accordance with fas and fas and recorded as an impairment loss 
in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and  as a result  we ceased to amortize our goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual impairment review of goodwill 
income taxes we have net deferred tax assets of million at december  we provide for deferred taxes in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes 
under fas  a valuation allowance must be established to offset a deferred tax asset if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   we had recorded a valuation allowance for all state nols 
we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period this determination was made 
new accounting standards 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas business combinations and fas goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted these standards on january   which among other requirements  i prohibit the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations  ii create more specific criteria for identifying other intangible assets which are acquired in a business combination  iii provide that goodwill not be amortized in any circumstance  and iv require that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances occurring between annual tests indicate that goodwill for a reporting unit might be impaired 
fas established a new method for testing goodwill for impairment based on a fair value concept 
we completed our fair value testing of goodwill balances during the quarter ended march  and determined that our existing goodwill balances were not impaired under the new standards 
upon adoption of the standards on january   we ceased to amortize our remaining goodwill balance 
goodwill amortization was approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in june  the fasb issued fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the statement requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred 
upon initial recognition of a liability  that cost should be capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
we adopted fas on january   and  based on current circumstances  we do not believe that our adoption of fas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
fas nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
historically  we have not entered into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk or for speculative purposes 
however  in november  we did enter into an interest rate swap arrangement 
a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
long term debt we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed interest rate senior subordinated notes 
the bank credit facility has a variable interest rate and  accordingly  is not subject to interest rate risk 
all other things being equal  the fair market value of debt with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall 
conversely  the fair market value of this debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
our policy has historically been to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap instrument  which effectively converted our senior subordinated notes to a floating rate for a two year period ending in december on july   we terminated the swap instrument and received a payment of  the total benefit recognized under the swap instrument as a reduction to interest expense  including the termination fee  was million for the year ended december  our senior subordinated notes mature on december  there are no scheduled principal payments under the notes prior to the maturity date 
however  all or some of the notes may be redeemed at a premium after december  we have no current plans to repay the notes ahead of their scheduled maturity 
foreign currency our principal foreign operations are conducted in canada and  since the acquisition of ava in  in areas surrounding the mediterranean sea 
there is exposure to future earnings due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 
we primarily conduct our business in the functional currency of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
historically  we have not used off balance sheet financial hedging instruments to manage foreign currency risks when we enter into a transaction denominated in a currency other than our local currencies because the dollar amount of these transactions has not warranted our using hedging instruments
