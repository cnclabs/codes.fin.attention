item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction papa john s international  inc referred to as the company  papa john s or in the first person notations of we  us and our began operations in with the opening of the first papa john s restaurant in jeffersonville  indiana 
at december   there were  papa john s restaurants in operation  consisting of company owned and  franchised  and franchised perfect pizza restaurants in the united kingdom 
our revenues are principally derived from retail sales of pizza to the general public by company owned restaurants  franchise royalties  sales of franchise and development rights  sales to franchisees of food and paper products  restaurant equipment  printing and promotional items  risk management services  and information systems and related services used in their operations 
new unit openings in were as compared to in several factors impacted this reduction in unit openings  including the competitive sales environment  operating margin pressures due to increased wages  insurance and other costs and the overall economic environment including franchisees access to capital 
the rate of future unit expansion will also be impacted by these and other factors 
unit closings in were as compared to in the closings in and were due to many of the same factors impacting unit openings and the rate of future closings will also be impacted by these and other factors 
we believe our strategy has allowed us to continue to enjoy strong average sales from our company owned restaurants even with a very competitive market environment 
our expansion strategy is to cluster restaurants in targeted markets  thereby increasing consumer awareness and enabling us to take advantage of operational  distribution and advertising efficiencies 
average sales for our most recent quarter s comparable base restaurants increased to  for week year  from  for week year  as compared to  for week year 
average sales volumes in new markets are generally lower than in those markets in which we have established a significant market position 
the comparable annual sales for company owned restaurants increased in  decreased in and increased in the relatively flat comparable sales in and the decrease in comparable sales during is the result of an increased competitive market 
the decrease in also reflects our decision to decrease our advertising expenditures as we concentrated on improving restaurant operations 
we continually strive to obtain high quality sites with good access and visibility  and to enhance the appearance and quality of our restaurants 
we believe that these factors improve our image and brand awareness 
the average cash investment for the domestic company owned restaurants opened during  exclusive of land  decreased to approximately  from  for the units opened in we expect the average cash investment for restaurants opening in to be approximately  approximately of our revenues for  for and for were derived from the sale to franchisees of food and paper products  restaurant equipment  printing and promotional items  risk management services and information systems equipment and software and related services by us  our commissary subsidiary  pj food service  inc  our support services subsidiary  papa john s support services  inc  our insurance subsidiaries  rsc insurance services  ltd 
and risk services corp 
and our united kingdom subsidiary  papa john s uk 
we believe that  in addition to supporting both company and franchised growth  these subsidiaries contribute to product quality and consistency and restaurant profitability throughout the papa john s system 
our fiscal year ends on the last sunday in december of each year 
all fiscal years presented consist of weeks  except for the fiscal year  which consists of weeks 
restaurant initiatives we have developed and implemented certain quality initiatives  intended to better evaluate and monitor the quality and consistency of the customer experience  which we believe will help us deliver on the better ingredients 
better pizza 
promise 
the costs of these initiatives were approximately million in and are expected to be approximately million in on a fully implemented basis 
in august  we implemented an across the board increase in base pay for restaurant general managers and assistant managers in an effort to attract and retain the desired quality of individuals to these critical positions 
the cost of these increases was approximately million in and is expected to be approximately million in on a full year basis 
in january  we realigned field operations management by combining the area supervisor and district manager positions into a director of operations position 
a director of operations is responsible for seven restaurants on average  thus providing higher quality direct support to our general managers and their teams 
the cost savings from the field management realignment are being invested back into our restaurants in the form of increased staffing and greater bonus opportunities for general managers and their assistants 
from a financial reporting perspective  this will result in a shift in reported expenses from the general and administrative expense category to the restaurant salaries and benefits expense category in the consolidated income statement 
the full year impact of this shift is expected to approximate million  representing a decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of total consolidated revenues and a increase in restaurant salaries and benefits as a percentage of restaurant sales  each compared to the actual results 
management believes these initiatives are beginning to produce improvements in product and service quality and consistency at our restaurants 
additionally  turnover in the key restaurant management positions has been reduced since the august base pay increase  further improving operations ability to deliver a consistently high quality customer experience 
given the extremely competitive sales environment and generally sluggish economy  management is unable to predict when meaningful improvement in restaurant sales and other financial results attributable to these restaurant initiatives will occur 
results of operations and critical accounting policies and estimates the results of operations are based on the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to select accounting policies for critical accounting areas as well as estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
significant changes in assumptions and or conditions in our critical accounting policies could materially impact the operating results 
we have identified the following accounting policies and related judgments as critical to understanding the results of our operations 
substantially all revenues are derived from the retail sales of pizza to the general public by company owned restaurants  franchise royalties  sales of franchise and development rights and sales to franchisees of food and paper products  restaurant equipment  printing and promotional items  risk management services and information and related services used in their operations 
we recognize franchise fees when a franchised restaurant begins operation  at which time we have performed our obligations related to such fees 
fees received pursuant to development agreements  which grant the right to develop franchised restaurants in future periods in specific geographic areas  are deferred and recognized on a pro rata basis as the franchised restaurants subject to the development agreements begin operations 
both franchise and development fees are nonrefundable 
franchise royalties  which are based on a percentage of franchise restaurants sales  are recognized as earned 
domestic production and distribution revenues are comprised of food  equipment and supplies sales to franchised restaurants located in the united states and are recognized as revenue upon shipment of the related products to the franchisees 
information services  including software maintenance fees  help desk fees  customer opportunity desk fees and on line ordering fees are recognized as revenue as the related services are provided 
insurance premiums and commissions are recognized as revenue over the term of the policy period 
international revenues are comprised of restaurant sales  royalties and fees received from foreign franchisees and the sale and distribution of food to foreign franchisees  and are recognized consistently with the policies applied for revenues generated in the united states 
we establish reserves for uncollectible accounts and notes receivable based on overall receivable aging levels and a specific evaluation of accounts and notes for franchisees with known financial difficulties 
the recoverability of long lived and intangible assets ie  goodwill is evaluated annually or more frequently if an impairment indicator exists 
we consider several indicators in assessing if impairment has occurred  including historical financial performance  operating trends and our future operating plans 
if impairment indicators exist  we evaluate long lived assets on an operating unit basis eg an individual restaurant whether impairment exists on the basis of undiscounted expected future cash flows before interest for the expected remaining useful life of the operating unit 
if impairment indicators exist for goodwill  impairment is evaluated on a reporting unit basis using criteria similar to that of long lived assets 
recorded values that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows are written down to current fair value  which is generally determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows for assets held for use or net realizable value for assets held for sale 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record initial or increased impairment charges for these assets 
our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  owned and non owned automobiles and health insurance coverage provided to our employees  and the captive insurance program provided to our franchisees are self insured up to certain individual and aggregate reinsurance levels 
claims in excess of self insurance levels are fully insured 
losses are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate retained liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial projections and our claims loss experience 
the estimated insurance claims losses could be significantly affected should the frequency or ultimate cost of claims significantly differ from historical trends 
accounting changes sfas no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with the adoption of sfas no 
 companies no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
instead  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are subject to an annual review for impairment 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment 
as of december  and december   our consolidated balance sheets included million and million of goodwill  net of accumulated amortization of million and million  respectively 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a reduction of approximately million in amortization expense beginning in proforma earnings per common share  assuming dilution  for under the provisions of sfas no 
were 
the impairment review performed by the company at the beginning of fiscal and as of december   in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
sfas no 
in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for the company in fiscal year sfas no 
superseded sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
required one accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held or used or newly acquired  and it broadened the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or our consolidated financial statement presentation in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  effective for the company in fiscal sfas no 
addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf relates to the recognition date of a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity 
under sfas no 
 companies will be required to recognize a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred instead of at the date of a company s commitment to an exit plan as once permitted under eitf costs addressed by sfas no 
include one time termination benefits provided to employees that are involuntarily terminated  costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease  costs to consolidate or close facilities  and costs to relocate employees 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on our results of operations or our consolidated financial statement disclosures 
sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas no 
 effective for the company in fiscal the only pertinent changes to the company  as provided by sfas no 
 are the required disclosures regarding the method used by a company in accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method on reported results in both interim and annual financial statements 
the company adopted the required disclosures in fiscal sfas no 
effective at the beginning of fiscal  we elected to expense the cost of employee stock options in accordance with the fair value method contained in sfas no 
under sfas no 
 the fair value for options is estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
the election was effective as of the beginning of fiscal and applies to all stock options issued after the effective date 
the compensation expense recognized in due to the adoption of sfas no 
was minimal 
prior to  we followed accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for our employee stock options 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense is recognized provided the exercise price of employee stock options equals or exceeds the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
had we followed sfas no 
in prior years by recording the fair value of options at the date of grant as a compensation expense over the vesting period  earnings per share would have been reduced by in  in and in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
interpretation no 
of accounting research bulletin no 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  that addresses the potential consolidation of variable interest entities vie s 
this interpretation would be applied to existing vie s as of the beginning of the first interim period subsequent to june  and would apply immediately to vie s created after january  we have a purchasing arrangement with a third party entity  bibp commodities  inc bibp  formed at the direction of our franchise advisory council for the sole purpose of reducing cheese price volatility 
bibp purchases cheese at the market price and sells it to our distribution subsidiary  pj food service  inc pjfs  at a fixed quarterly price based in part upon historical average market prices 
pjfs in turn sells cheese to papa john s restaurants company owned and franchised at a set quarterly price 
the purchase of cheese by pjfs from bibp is not guaranteed 
pjfs purchased million  million and million of cheese during  and  respectively  from bibp 
bibp has a million line of credit with a commercial bank 
the million line of credit is not guaranteed by papa john s 
papa john s has a commitment to lend up to million to bibp if the million line of credit is fully utilized 
bibp did not have any outstanding borrowings under either credit facility at december  or december  gains or losses incurred by bibp  due to differences in the actual market price of cheese purchased and the established quarterly sales price  are factors used to determine the price for subsequent quarters 
had bibp not been in existence and pjfs had therefore been required to purchase cheese at actual market prices  our consolidated net income would have increased by approximately million in  decreased by approximately million in and increased by approximately million in the following are summarized financial statements of bibp summarized statements of operations in thousands sales to pjfs cost of sales administrative expense investment income expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income summarized balance sheets in thousands cash and cash equivalents other current assets total assets current liabilities stockholders equity deficit total liabilities and stockholders equity deficit we are currently reviewing interpretation no

compared to revenues 
total revenues decreased to million in  from million in domestic company owned restaurant sales decreased to million in  from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of equivalent company owned units open in as compared to as a result of the sale or closure of company owned units the divested restaurants having lower than average sales 
this decrease is partially offset by a increase in comparable sales for the period 
equivalent units represents the number of restaurants open at the beginning of a given period  adjusted for restaurants opened  closed  acquired or sold during the period on a weighted average basis 
domestic franchise sales increased to billion in  from billion in this increase primarily resulted from a increase in the number of equivalent franchised domestic restaurants open in compared to  partially offset by a comparable sales decrease in domestic franchise royalties increased to million in  from million in  due to the increase in domestic franchise sales noted above

the restaurant operating margin for domestic company owned units was in compared to in  consisting of the following differences cost of sales was lower in due to lower prices for certain commodities such as boxes and meats and a higher average sales price point 
salaries and benefits were lower in due to the higher average sales price point  partially offset by the impact of the across the board increase in base pay for general managers and assistant managers implemented during the third quarter of  and other general compensation increases

a provision for uncollectible notes receivable of million was recorded for based on our evaluation of our franchise loan portfolio 
the provision for uncollectible notes receivable was  in pre opening and other general expenses were million for compared to million in the amount includes  of pre opening costs   of relocation costs  million of disposition and valuation losses for restaurants and other assets   of estimated costs related to the refurbishment program for our heated delivery bag system and million of losses related to a terminated vendor relationship 
the vendor was obligated to repay certain funds advanced by us upon obtaining outside bank financing in the fourth quarter of the vendor was not able to obtain such financing by the required date and  accordingly  we terminated the relationship and reserved amounts advanced based upon an evaluation of their collectibility 
the amount includes pre opening costs of  relocation costs of  and net losses on impairment and disposition related costs of million 
the amount also includes costs related to certain franchisee support initiatives 
as noted above  we incurred approximately  of costs during in connection with a refurbishment plan developed by the supplier of our heated delivery bag system  expected to reduce the failure rate of such systems currently in use at substantially all domestic company owned restaurants and approximately  domestic franchised restaurants 
at december   we held delivery bag system inventory valued at approximately million for resale to franchised restaurants or installation in company owned restaurants  and also had approximately  of outstanding accounts receivable related to the sale of delivery bag systems to franchisees 
through year end  approximately of the deployed heated delivery bag system units had been refurbished under the plan  and the failure rate for those refurbished units has met thresholds of acceptability established by the company 
accordingly  we do not expect additional losses related to the heated delivery bag system  including the realization of inventory values or collection of receivables related thereto 
depreciation and amortization was million of revenues in compared to million of revenues in  including goodwill amortization of million for there is no goodwill amortization in with the adoption of sfas no

cash flow from operations for increased to million from million in due primarily to changes in deferred income taxes and other working capital  principally a reduction in inventory levels 
in january  we entered into an agreement to extend our revolving line of credit facility new line of credit 
the new line of credit allows us to borrow up to million with an expiration date in january outstanding balances for the new line of credit accrue interest at to basis points over the london interbank offered rate libor or other bank developed rates at our option 
the commitment fee on the unused balance ranges from to basis points 
the increment over libor and the commitment fee are determined quarterly based upon the ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
we require capital primarily for the development  acquisition and maintenance of restaurants  new or replacement qc centers and support services facilities  the enhancement of corporate systems and facilities and the funding of franchisee loans 
additionally  we began a common stock repurchase program in december during  common stock repurchases of million and capital expenditures of million were primarily funded by cash flow from operations  net proceeds from the revolving line of credit facility  net loan repayments from franchisees  proceeds from stock option exercises and available cash and cash equivalents 
total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million to million  about one half of which is for the development  relocation or remodeling of restaurants  including routine replacement of worn equipment  and about one half of which is for qc centers  support services and corporate requirements 
during  we plan to open approximately new domestic company owned restaurants 
as of december   we had loans to franchisees of million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
we do not have any additional loan funding commitments related to existing franchisee loans at december  we do not plan to extend loans to franchisees in the future 
the board of directors has authorized up to million for the share repurchase program through december  at december   a total of million shares have been repurchased for million at an average price of per share since the repurchase program started in approximately million shares in  million shares in  million shares in and million shares in 
subsequent to year end through march   we acquired an additional  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
as of march   approximately million of common stock remains available for repurchase under this authorization 
we expect to fund the planned capital expenditures and any additional share repurchases for the next twelve months from operating cash flow and any remaining availability under our new line of credit  reduced for outstanding letters of credit of million 
our debt  which is primarily due to the share repurchase program  was million at december   compared to million at december  through december  we have earned approximately million million in  million in and million in previous years of an expected million in incentives under the kentucky jobs development act in connection with the relocation of the corporate offices 
we expect to earn the remaining million of such incentives through contractual obligations and payments as of december  due by year reflecting the january new line of credit terms are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than after year years years years total contractual obligations long term debt revolving line of credit total debt operating leases total contractual obligations excludes a fair value adjustment of million included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet related to our interest rate collar and swap that hedge against the effects of rising interest rates on forecasted future borrowings

such commitments include the following by year in thousands amount of commitment expiration per period less than after year years years years total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to contractual and other commitments 
impact of inflation we do not believe inflation has materially affected earnings during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs  particularly commodities  labor  benefits  utilities and fuel  could have a significant impact on us 
forward looking statements certain information contained in this annual report  particularly information regarding future financial performance and plans and objectives of management  is forward looking 
certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the selection and availability of suitable restaurant locations  increases in commodities  labor and insurance costs  negotiation of suitable lease or financing terms  constraints on permitting and construction of restaurants  higher than anticipated construction costs  the hiring  training and retention of management and other personnel  changes in pricing or other marketing or promotional strategies of one or more of our major competitors  changes in consumer taste  demographic trends  traffic patterns and the type  number and location of competing restaurants  and federal and state laws governing such matters as wages  working conditions  citizenship requirements and overtime 
these factors might be especially harmful to the financial viability of franchisees in under penetrated or emerging markets  possibly leading to greater unit closings than anticipated 
our domestic and international operations could be negatively impacted by significant changes in international economic and political conditions 
in addition  our international operations are subject to additional factors  including currency regulations and fluctuations  differing cultures and consumer preferences  diverse government regulations and structures  availability and cost of land and construction  ability to source high quality ingredients and other commodities in a cost effective manner  differing interpretation of the obligations established in franchise agreements with international franchisees  and the successful conversion of perfect pizza restaurants to papa john s restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our debt at december  is principally comprised of a million outstanding principal balance on the million unsecured revolving line of credit 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is variable and is based on libor plus a to basis point spread  tiered based upon debt and cash flow levels

additionally  in march  an increase in the interest rate of basis points  as mitigated by the interest rate swap  would have the same impact on interest expense as that noted in connection with the interest rate collar as of december   assuming similar debt balances
