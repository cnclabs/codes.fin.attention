overview we are the world s largest manufacturer of cabin interior products for commercial aircraft and for business jets and a leading distributor of aftermarket fasteners 
we serve virtually all major airlines and a wide variety of business jet customers and airframe manufacturers 
we believe that we have achieved leading global market positions in each of our major product categories  which include o commercial aircraft seats  including an extensive line of first class  business class  tourist class and regional aircraft seats  o a full line of aircraft food and beverage preparation and storage equipment  including coffeemakers  water boilers  beverage containers  refrigerators  freezers  chillers and high heat and convection ovens  o both chemical and gaseous aircraft oxygen delivery systems  o business jet and general aviation interior products  including an extensive line of executive aircraft seats  indirect overhead lighting systems  oxygen  safety and air valve products  and o a broad line of aftermarket fasteners  covering over  skus 
we design  develop and manufacture a broad range of cabin interior structures and provide comprehensive aircraft cabin interior reconfiguration and passenger to freighter conversion engineering services and component kits 
we generally derive our revenues from two primary sources refurbishment or upgrade programs for the existing worldwide fleets of commercial and general aviation aircraft and new aircraft deliveries 
we believe our large installed base of products  estimated to be over billion as of december  valued at replacement prices  gives us a significant advantage over our competitors in obtaining orders both for spare parts and for refurbishment programs  principally due to the tendency of the airlines to purchase equipment for such programs from the original supplier 
for the transition period ended december   approximately of our revenues were from the aftermarket and were from new aircraft deliveries 
for fiscal year  of our revenues were from the aftermarket and were from new aircraft deliveries 
for fiscal year  of our revenues were from the aftermarket and were from new aircraft deliveries 
we conduct our operations through strategic business units that have been aggregated under three reportable segments commercial aircraft products  business jet products and fastener distribution 
net sales by line of business were as follows fiscal year ended ten month period ended dec

in fiscal  we generated approximately of our total revenues from sales outside the us  and approximately of total revenues were generated in europe and approximately was generated in asia 
in fiscal  we generated approximately of our total revenues from sales outside the us  and approximately of total revenues were generated in europe and approximately was generated in asia 
financial and other information by segment and relating to foreign and domestic operations for each of the ten month transition period ending december   and the fiscal years ended february  and february   is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have substantially expanded the size  scope and nature of our business through a number of acquisitions 
since  we have completed acquisitions  including one acquisition during the transition period ended december   three during fiscal year and four during fiscal year  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  in order to position ourselves as the preferred global supplier to our customers 
during the period from to  we integrated the acquired businesses  closing facilities  reducing our workforce by  positions and implementing common information technology platforms and lean manufacturing initiatives company wide 
this integration effort resulted in costs and charges totaling approximately the rapid decline in industry conditions brought about by the terrorist attacks on september  caused us to implement a facility consolidation and integration plan designed to re align our capacity and cost structure with changed conditions in the airline industry 
the facility consolidation and integration plan includes closing five facilities and reducing workforce by approximately  employees 
the total estimated cost of this program is approximately  including of cash charges 
through december   we had incurred approximately of the cash costs and expect to incur the remaining during the first half of calendar all of the aforementioned initiatives to integrate  rationalize and restructure the businesses acquired through december  had an aggregate cost of approximately  which has already been expensed 
these initiatives enabled us to eliminate a total of facilities  with one additional facility expected to be closed by mid  and reduce headcount by over  employees  with an additional reduction of approximately expected in connection with the closure of the aforementioned facility by mid we believe these initiatives will enable us to substantially expand profit margins when industry conditions improve and demand increases  strengthen the global business management focus on our core product categories  more effectively leverage our resources and improve our ability to rapidly react to changing business conditions 
in conjunction with these efforts  we have also implemented a company wide information technology system  a company wide engineering system and initiated lean manufacturing techniques in our remaining facilities 
common management information and engineering systems and lean manufacturing processes across all operations  coupled with a rationalized product offering  are expected to provide us with the ongoing benefit of a generally lower cost structure  and expanding gross and operating margins 
new product development is a strategic tool for our company 
our customers regularly request that we engage in new product development and enhancement activities 
we believe that these activities  if properly focused and managed  will protect and enhance our leadership position 
research  development and engineering spending have been approximately of sales for the past several years  and is expected to remain at that level for the foreseeable future 
we also believe in providing our businesses with the tools required to remain competitive 
in that regard  we have  and will continue to invest in property and equipment that enhances our productivity 
over the past two years  annual capital expenditures were approximately taking into consideration our recent capital expenditure investments  current industry conditions and the recent acquisitions  we expect that annual capital expenditures will be approximately for the next few years 
recent acquisitions we completed the following significant acquisitions during fiscal and fiscal fiscal acquisitions effective february  we completed the acquisition of four companies that specialize in manufacturing precision machined components and assemblies for the aerospace industry 
we acquired these businesses  alson industries  inc  tl windust machine  inc  dmgi  inc 
and maynard precision  inc  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately fiscal acquisitions in may  we acquired the outstanding common stock of nelson aero space  inc for approximately in july  we acquired the outstanding common stock of denton jet interiors  inc for approximately on september   we acquired m m for a purchase price of m m is a leading distributor of aerospace fasteners 
the m m acquisition was completed by issuing to the former shareholders a total of approximately million shares of our stock  paying them in cash and assuming current liabilities of approximately we financed this acquisition through cash on hand and approximately of borrowings under our bank credit facility 
results of operations the transition period from february  to december  compared to the ten month period from february  to december  consolidated results to assist in understanding the performance of our operations  where noted  the results discussed below have been adjusted to exclude the effect of certain facility and workforce consolidation costs  as well as certain unusual or nonrecurring items 
by presenting as adjusted results  we intend to provide a better understanding of the core results and underlying trends from which to consider not only past performance  but also the prospects for the future 
in each case where as adjusted results are discussed  all of the differences from our reported results are given to reconcile the reported results to the as adjusted results 
users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions for which adjustments have been made 
in addition to providing a discussion of reported results  results for the comparable period in the prior year have also been prepared on a pro forma basis treating companies acquired during the ten month period ended december  as though acquired as of february  by also discussing these pro forma results  we intend to enhance comparability between periods and make an analysis of the current period results more meaningful 
pro forma adjustments would have increased net sales  gross profit  selling  general and administrative expenses  operating earnings  interest expense and net earnings by     and  respectively  for the ten month period ended december  results for the current transition period ended december  have not been prepared on a pro forma basis  as we made no significant acquisitions in the current period 
these as adjusted and pro forma results do not conform to us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
while we believe that these measures are useful aids in understanding our results in the periods shown  as the magnitude of these items is such that it is important for readers of this discussion and analysis to be aware of these items and the effect that they had on our results during the periods presented and we use these measures to evaluate our performance 
these as adjusted and pro forma results should be used only in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with gaap 
the pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the acquisitions been completed as of the date indicated 
revenues were negatively impacted by the severe change in industry conditions following the terrorist attacks on september  net sales for the transition period ended december  were  which is or lower than net sales of for the comparable period in the prior year  which was also negatively impacted by the events of september  on a pro forma basis treating companies acquired during the ten month period ended december  as though acquired as of february   net sales during the transition period ended december  would have been or lower than pro forma net sales of for the prior period 
net sales for each of our segments are set forth in the following table transition ten month period ended of period ended of dec 
 net sales dec 
 net sales change commercial aircraft products business jet products fastener distribution total sales of commercial aircraft products were or lower than sales in the prior year  due to the recession in the airline industry and the further downturn in industry conditions following september  sales of business jet products and fastener distribution products also reflected restrained demand due to the aviation industry downturn 
because we acquired m m in september  the current period reflects the full ten month transition period of fastener distribution revenue compared with four months in the comparable period in the prior year 
on a pro forma basis treating companies acquired during the ten month period ended december  as though acquired as of february   sales of fastener distribution products were or lower than pro forma sales in the comparable period in the prior year 
pro forma adjustments would have increased sales of fastener distribution products by for the comparable period ended december  gross profit was  or of net sales for the transition period ended december  as compared to  or of sales for the ten month period ended december  the period over period increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales occurred despite the decrease in revenues and was due to a reduction in facility consolidation and integration costs and the positive impact of our facility consolidation efforts  lean manufacturing and continuous improvement programs 
on a pro forma basis treating companies acquired during the ten month period ended december  as though acquired as of february  and excluding facility and personnel consolidation and integration costs of in and in  gross profit on this pro forma  as adjusted basis would have been  or of sales for the transition period ended december  as compared to  or of pro forma sales for the ten month period ended december  this increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales on this pro forma  as adjusted basis occurred despite the or decrease in revenues  and was due to the positive impact of our facility consolidation and integration efforts  lean manufacturing and continuous improvement programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were or of net sales for the transition period ended december  as compared to or of net sales for the comparable period in the prior year 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to lower spending  primarily as a result of our facility consolidation and integration program and austerity measures  together with a decrease of related to the adoption of sfas no 
because we acquired m m in september  the current period reflects the full ten month period of selling  general and administrative expenses of  as compared with of such costs during the four months in the comparable period in the prior year 
on a pro forma basis treating companies acquired during the ten month period ended december   as though acquired as of february   pro forma  as adjusted  selling  general and administrative expenses would have been or of pro forma net sales for the comparable period in the prior year 
the period over period decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for the transition period ended december  compared to the pro forma  as adjusted  selling  general and administrative expenses in the comparable period in the prior year of or resulted from our austerity measures  a lower level of spending and the implementation of sfas no 

we incurred acquisition related expenses of in the prior period in connection with the acquisition of m m that have been excluded from the pro forma  as adjusted  figures in research  development and engineering expenses were or of net sales for the transition period ended december  as compared with or of sales for the comparable period in the prior year 
the period over period decrease in research  development and engineering expenses is primarily attributable to austerity measures  which were implemented subsequent to the september  terrorist attacks 
in february  we received an adverse result in an arbitration proceeding  which had been ongoing since october the decision reduced the amounts we originally sought in connection with the dispute  resulting in a net amount of million due to us 
the dispute concerned the sale of our in flight entertainment business to thales 
under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  we received million during  and were to receive two additional payments totaling million  and a third and final payment based on actual sales and bookings 
thales did not pay the million  or the third and final payment 
we initiated arbitration proceedings to compel payment in december thales counterclaimed against us  alleging various breaches of the purchase and sale agreement 
previously  we had recorded a receivable of million in connection with the sale of the business to thales 
as a result of the arbitration award  we reduced our note receivable by as of december   representing the difference between the arbitration panel s award and our previously recorded amounts 
despite a decrease in net sales  our operating loss for the current period decreased by compared to the operating loss in the comparable period in the prior year due to a decrease in facility consolidation and integration costs  and a decrease in operating expenses  excluding the arbitration result  arising from austerity measures and the implementation of sfas no 
on a pro forma basis treating companies acquired during the ten month period ended december   as though acquired as of february  and excluding facility and personnel consolidation and integration costs of and the arbitration award in and facility and personnel consolidation and integration costs of and acquisition related expenses of in  operating earnings on this pro forma  as adjusted basis declined by only  despite the decrease in revenues for the current transition period compared to pro forma revenues in the comparable period in the prior year  reflecting both lower manufacturing costs and lower operating expenses 
our gross margin calculated on the pro forma  as adjusted basis described above for both periods was nearly unchanged  reflecting the impact of our facility consolidation and integration initiatives 
period over period operating expenses calculated on the pro forma  as adjusted basis described above decreased by  which was attributable to austerity measures and a decrease of from the implementation of sfas no 
pro forma adjustments would have increased operating expenses by for the ten month period ended december  based on our results for the transition period ended december   we believe our facility consolidation and integration program has eliminated over of annualized cash costs 
interest expense  net was for the transition period ended december   or greater than interest expense of for the comparable period in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense is due to an increase in debt following the acquisition of m m in september and higher interest rates on our bank borrowings 
on a pro forma basis treating companies acquired during the ten month period ended december   as though acquired as of february   interest expense  net was for the transition period ended december   or greater than pro forma interest expense of for the comparable period in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense for the current transition period compared to pro forma interest expense in the comparable period in the prior year is due to higher interest rates on our bank borrowings 
the lower level of revenues  which was partially offset by lower facility consolidation and integration costs during the transition period ended december   resulted in a loss before income taxes and extraordinary item of or less than the loss before income taxes and extraordinary item in the comparable period in the prior year 
income tax expense for the transition period ended december  was as compared to in the comparable period in the prior year 
we recorded a extraordinary item during the ten month period ended december  related to the early extinguishment of certain long term debt 
net loss was or per share for the transition period ended december  as compared to a net loss of or per share for the comparable period in the prior year 
on a pro forma basis treating companies acquired during the ten month period ended december   as though acquired as of february  and excluding facility and personnel consolidation and integration costs of and the arbitration award in and facility and personnel consolidation costs of  acquisition related expenses of and debt extinguishment costs of in  our net loss on this pro forma  as adjusted basis would have been or per share for the transition period ended december  as compared to net earnings on this same pro forma  as adjusted basis of or per share for the comparable period in the prior year 
lower net sales and greater interest expense were the principal reasons for the decrease in net earnings on this pro forma  as adjusted basis as discussed further above

fiscal year ended february  compared with the fiscal year ended february  consolidated results revenues were negatively impacted by the severe change in industry conditions following the terrorist attacks on september  net sales for fiscal were  which is or greater than net sales of for the comparable period in the prior year 
this increase was entirely attributable to the acquisition of m m in september net sales for each of our segments are set forth in the following table fy fy change commercial aircraft products business jet products fastener distribution net sales at our commercial aircraft products segment were or lower than the prior year due to the recession in the airline industry and the further downturn in industry conditions following september  gross profit was  or of net sales for fiscal  including facility consolidation and integration expenses of  as compared to or of net sales in the prior year 
the decline in the gross margin was due to the facility consolidation and integration costs  excluding such costs  gross margin for fiscal was essentially unchanged from fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were or of net sales for fiscal as compared to or of net sales in fiscal the year over year increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from recent acquisitions 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal and were approximately and  respectively  of costs related to acquisitions we completed during each respective fiscal year 
research  development and engineering expenses were or of net sales for fiscal  as compared with or of sales in fiscal the year over year decrease in research  development and engineering expenses is primarily attributable to the timing of customer programs along with austerity measures we implemented subsequent to the september  terrorist attacks 
we generated an operating loss of during fiscal  including facility consolidation and related expenses of excluding such costs  we generated operating earnings of or of net sales  which was or lower than operating earnings of excluding acquisition related expenses of or of net sales in the prior year 
the decrease in operating earnings excluding such costs in fiscal is primarily attributable to the lower level of revenues from our businesses following the terrorist attacks on september  interest expense  net was for fiscal  or greater than interest expense of for the prior year 
the increase in interest expense is due to the larger amount of outstanding debt created by the refinancing of certain indebtedness during fiscal along with the impact of recent acquisitions 
the lower level of revenues and facility and integration consolidation costs during fiscal resulted in a loss before income taxes and extraordinary item of or less than income before income taxes in the prior year of earnings before facility consolidation and acquisition related expenses  income taxes  and extraordinary item in fiscal were  which was or lower than pretax earnings in fiscal of  calculated on the same basis 
income tax expense for fiscal was as compared to in the prior year 
the company recorded a extraordinary item during fiscal related to the early extinguishment of certain long term debt 
net loss earnings was or per share for fiscal  as compared to net earnings of or per share for fiscal liquidity and capital resources current financial condition our liquidity requirements consist of working capital needs  ongoing capital expenditures and payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness 
our primary requirements for working capital are directly related to the level of our operations  working capital  primarily accounts receivable and inventories  fluctuate with the demand for our product 
our working capital was as of december   as compared to as of february  at december   our cash and cash equivalents were as compared to at february  cash flows cash used in operating activities was during the transition period ended december  compared to cash provided by operations of for fiscal year the primary sources of cash during the transition period ending december  were a non cash impairment charge of  charges for depreciation and amortization of  a legal settlement charge of and a decrease in accounts receivable of the primary uses of cash were a net loss of  an increase in inventories of and a decrease in payables and accruals of the primary source of cash from investing activities was of proceeds received from real estate sales and sales leaseback transactions 
the primary uses of cash from investing activities were related to capital expenditures to implement new information system enhancements and plant modernization along with of cash used for acquisitions 
capital spending our capital expenditures were and during the transition period ended december  and the fiscal year ended february   respectively 
the period over period increase in capital expenditures is primarily attributable to plant consolidation and modernization efforts 
we anticipate ongoing annual capital expenditures of approximately for the next several years 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
we have  in the past  generally funded our capital expenditures from cash from operations and funds available to us under our bank credit facility 
we expect to fund future capital expenditures from cash on hand and from operations and from funds available to us under our bank credit facility 
in addition  since  we have completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately we have financed these acquisitions primarily through issuances of debt and equity securities  including our  and senior subordinated notes 
outstanding debt and other financing arrangements in january and march  the company obtained amendments to the credit facility with jp morgan chase 
the amended bank credit facility reduced the total commitments by to of which may be utilized for acquisitions during january the amended bank credit facility provides for another reduction in facility size to at december  the amended bank credit facility expires in august and is collateralized by substantially all of our cash  accounts receivable  inventories and other personal property 
at december   indebtedness under the old bank credit facility consisted of letters of credit aggregating approximately and outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility aggregating to bearing interest at libor plus  or approximately as of december  
the amended bank credit facility bears interest ranging from to basis points over the eurodollar rate as defined in the agreement or approximately as of the january effective date 
the amended bank credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants  negative covenants and conditions of borrowings  all of which were met as of december  we presented the reduction in commitments as short term debt in our consolidated balance sheet at december  in connection with a recapitalization of our company in april  we issued of senior subordinated notes due  pursuant to an indenture dated april   between us and the bank of new york  as trustee  and sold the notes to merrill lynch co  credit suisse first boston  jp morgan  cibc world markets and first union securities  inc on july   we exchanged the outstanding senior subordinated notes due with an aggregate value of principal amount for senior subordinated notes due  series b  registered under the securities act of long term debt consists principally of our senior subordinated notes  senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes and borrowings outstanding under the amended bank credit facility net of the reduction in commitments  which is a component of short term debt 
the of notes mature on march   the of notes mature on november  and the of notes mature on may  the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and are subordinated to all of our senior indebtedness 
each of the notes  notes and notes contain restrictive covenants  including limitations on future indebtedness  restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  liens  dividends  mergers and transfers of assets  all of which were met by us as of december  a breach of such covenants  or the covenants under our amended bank credit facility  that continues beyond any grace period can constitute a default  which can limit the ability to borrow and can give rise to a right of the lenders to terminate the applicable facility and or require immediate repayment of any outstanding debt 
contractual and other obligations the following charts reflect our contractual obligations and commercial cash commitments as of december  commercial commitments include lines of credit  guarantees and other potential cash outflows resulting from a contingent event that requires performance by us or our subsidiaries pursuant to a funding commitment 
contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt operating leases total commercial commitments letters of credit we believe that our cash flow from operations which provides us with our ability to fund our operations  make planned capital expenditures  make scheduled payments and refinance our indebtedness depends on our future operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
the september  terrorist attacks have severely impacted conditions in the airline industry 
accordingly  the airlines are seeking to conserve cash in part by deferring or eliminating cabin interior refurbishment programs and canceling or deferring aircraft purchases 
this has caused a substantial contraction in our business  the extent and duration of which cannot be determined at this time 
however  we believe that our operating cash flow  cash and cash equivalents  borrowing capacity under our amended bank credit facility  and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund our operating needs  including contractual and other obligations  and to service our debt obligations for the foreseeable future 
sale leaseback during the third quarter of  we entered into two sale leaseback transactions involving four of our facilities 
under the terms of the sale leaseback agreements  the facilities were sold for  net of transaction costs  and have been leased back for periods ranging from to years 
the leasebacks have been accounted for as operating leases 
the future lease payments have been included in the above tables 
a gain of resulting from the sales have been deferred and will be amortized on a straight line basis to rent expense over the initial term of the leases 
off balance sheet arrangements lease arrangements we finance our use of certain facilities and equipment under committed lease arrangements provided by various institutions 
since the terms of these arrangements meet the accounting definition of operating lease arrangements  the aggregate sum of future minimum lease payments is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   future minimum lease payments under these arrangements approximated we also have various other arrangements whose future minimum lease payments approximated at december indemnities  commitments and guarantees during our normal course of business  we have made certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these indemnities include non infringement of patents and intellectual property indemnities to our customers in connection with the delivery  design  manufacture and sale of its products  indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease  indemnities to other parties to certain acquisition agreements and indemnities to our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  is indefinite 
substantially all of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees provide for limitations on the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets we established a valuation allowance of as of december  related to the utilization of our deferred tax assets because of uncertainties that preclude us from determining that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate taxable income to realize such assets during the federal operating loss carryforward period 
the federal operating loss carryforward begins to expire in such uncertainties include recent cumulative losses attributable to the recent industry conditions  the highly cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate  risks associated with our facility consolidation and integration plan  our high degree of financial leverage  risks associated with new product introductions  recent increases in the cost of fuel and its impact on our airline customers  and risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses 
we monitor these uncertainties  as well as other positive and negative factors that may arise in the future  as we assess the necessity for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
 among other things  requires gains and losses on extinguishment of debt to be classified as part of continuing operations rather than treated as extraordinary  as previously required in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
also modifies accounting for subleases where the original lessee remains the secondary obligor and requires certain modifications to capital leases to be treated as sale leaseback transactions 
we will adopt sfas no 
on january  and expect no material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
nullifies the guidance previously provided under emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
among other things  sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred as opposed to when there is a commitment to a restructuring plan as set forth under the nullified guidance 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
on january  for future restructurings as required 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations as we have no plans to adopt the fair value method 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fin no 
 and  and rescission of fin no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while  the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of the recognition provisions of fin no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin no 
requires that variable interest entities be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin no 
also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that companies are not required to consolidate but in which a company has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
will apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements will apply to entities established prior to january  in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  the disclosure requirements will apply in all financial statements issued after january  we will begin to adopt the provisions of fin no 
during the first quarter of calendar but expect the provisions of fin no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position upon adoption as we do not currently have any variable interest entities 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales of products are recorded on the date of shipment and passage of title  or if required  upon acceptance by the customer 
service revenues are recorded when services are performed 
revenues and costs under certain long term contracts are recognized using contract accounting under the percentage of completion method 
we sell our products primarily to airlines and aircraft manufacturers worldwide  including occasional sales collateralized by letters of credit 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain reserves for estimated credit losses 
actual losses have been within management s expectations 
we apply judgment to ensure that the criteria for recognizing sales are consistently applied and achieved for all recognized sales transactions 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
as demonstrated during the transition period ended december  and the fiscal year ended february   demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory were determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
long lived assets including tangible and intangible assets and goodwill to conduct our global business operations and execute our strategy  we acquire tangible and intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we may incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess potential impairment to intangible assets of a reporting unit on an annual basis or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  market conditions and other factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other acquired tangible or intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating income losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations

risk factors we are directly dependent upon the conditions in the airline industry and a severe and prolonged downturn could negatively impact our results of operations the september  terrorist attacks have severely impacted conditions in the airline industry 
sharply lower demand from our airline customer base affected our financial results  both for the transition period ended december  and the fiscal year ended february  the lower demand reflects the current downturn in the airline industry  which is the most severe ever experienced 
high airline operating costs  weak air travel and low ticket prices have damaged many carriers financial condition 
prior to the september  terrorist attacks  airline profits were already being adversely affected by increases in pilot and other airline wages  higher fuel prices and the softening of the global economy 
air travel dropped significantly following the terrorist attacks  further weakening many airlines financial condition 
to cut costs  carriers worldwide have reduced fleet sizes  parking or idling about  aircraft  or of their fleets  as of december in an attempt to stimulate air travel  airlines have decreased domestic airfares to levels not seen since reflecting the reduction in air travel and fares  north american airline revenue has dropped since as a result of these factors  the us airline industry incurred a billion loss in calendar and an billion loss in calendar the airline industry crisis caused two major domestic airlines  us airways and united airlines  to file for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy act and industry experts believe other major domestic carriers may be required to do so as well 
in addition  at least one smaller domestic carrier  national airlines  has ceased operations entirely 
accordingly  the airlines are seeking to conserve cash in part by deferring or eliminating cabin interior refurbishment programs and deferring or canceling aircraft purchases 
this has caused a substantial contraction in our business  the extent and duration of which cannot be determined at this time 
we expect these adverse industry conditions to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition until such time as conditions in the industry improve 
industry conditions could also deteriorate further if there is a prolonged war in iraq or other outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities 
several airlines have recently announced additional employee layoffs and the parking or idling of additional aircraft citing the commencement of hostilities with iraq  along with rising fuel prices and the threat of terrorism 
the airline industry is also undergoing a process of consolidation and significantly increased competition 
such consolidation could result in a reduction of future aircraft orders as overlapping routes are eliminated and airlines seek greater economies through higher aircraft utilization 
our substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and will require that a significant portion of our cash flow be used for debt service we have substantial indebtedness and  as a result  significant debt service obligations 
as of december   we had approximately of net indebtedness outstanding  representing approximately of total capitalization 
the degree of our leverage and  as a result  significant debt service obligations  could have significant consequences to purchasers or holders of our shares of common stock  including o limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our growth strategy  working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other general corporate requirements  o limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of those funds to fund debt service obligations  o increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  and o if we are able to replace our bank credit facility  increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because borrowings under a new bank credit facility will likely be at variable interest rates 
we may not be able to generate the necessary amount of cash to service our indebtedness  which may require us to refinance our debt  obtain additional financing or sell assets our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations will depend upon  among other things  our future operating performance and our ability to refinance indebtedness when necessary 
each of these factors is to a large extent dependent on economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
if  in the future  we cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our debt service obligations  we will need to refinance  obtain additional financing or sell assets 
our business may not generate cash flow  and we may not be able to obtain funding  sufficient to satisfy our debt service requirements 
we have significant financial and operating restrictions in our debt instruments that may have an adverse affect on our operations the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain numerous financial and operating covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to create liens or other encumbrances  to make certain payments and investments  including dividend payments and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities 
agreements governing future indebtedness could also contain significant financial and operating restrictions 
our amended bank credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants 
a failure to comply with the obligations contained in any current or future agreements governing our indebtedness  including our indentures  could result in an event of default under our amended bank credit facility  or such indentures  which could permit acceleration of the related debt and acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
we are not certain whether we would have  or be able to obtain  sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments 
the airline industry is heavily regulated and failure to comply with applicable laws could reduce our sales  or require us to incur additional costs to achieve compliance  which could reduce our results of operations the federal aviation administration prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft components  including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation cabin interior products  and licenses component repair stations within the united states 
comparable agencies  such as the uk civil aviation authority and the japanese civil aviation board  regulate these matters in other countries 
if we fail to obtain a required license for one of our products or services or lose a license previously granted  the sale of the subject product or service would be prohibited by law until such license is obtained or renewed 
in addition  designing new products to meet existing regulatory requirements and retrofitting installed products to comply with new regulatory requirements can be both expensive and time consuming 
from time to time the faa proposes new regulations 
these new regulations generally cause an increase in costs to comply with these regulations  when the faa first enacted technical standard order c  all seating companies were required to meet these new rules 
compliance with this rule required industry participants to spend millions of dollars on engineering  plant and equipment to comply with the regulation 
a number of smaller seating companies decided that they did not have the resources  financial or otherwise  to comply with these rules and they either sold their businesses or ceased operations 
to the extent the faa implements rule changes in the future  we may incur additional costs to achieve compliance 
there are risks associated with the implementation of our facility consolidation program  failure to integrate our combined operations successfully could lead to a loss of revenues and customers we have developed a comprehensive facility consolidation and integration plan  which is designed to reduce our capacity and fixed costs consistent with current demand and anticipated demand 
this plan involves shutting five principal facilities  transferring the operations to another facility while maintaining an ongoing business for the transferred operations 
if we are not successful in implementing this plan  our costs may not be as currently anticipated  we may incur delays in delivering products to our customers  which could result in significant penalty payments to our customers and the airframe manufacturers 
while the facility consolidation program is on track as of the date of this report  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the implementation of this effort or that we will not incur liabilities as a result thereof 
the airline industry is subject to extensive health and environmental regulation  any violation of which could subject us to significant liabilities and penalties we are subject to extensive and changing federal  state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health and environmental quality standards  and may be subject to liability or penalties for violations of those standards 
we are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or to which we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment  recycling or disposal 
we may be subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations 
in addition  we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities  or at facilities we may acquire 
we compete with a number of established companies  some of which have significantly greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we do and we may not be able to compete effectively with these companies we compete with numerous established companies 
some of these companies  particularly in the passenger to freighter conversion business  have significantly greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we do 
our ability to be an effective competitor will depend on our ability to remain the supplier of retrofit and refurbishment products and spare parts on the commercial fleets on which our products are currently in service 
it will also depend on our success in causing our products to be selected for installation in new aircraft  including next generation aircraft  and in avoiding product obsolescence 
our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the rapidly growing passenger to freighter conversion business will depend on our success in being selected to convert specific aircraft  our ability to maintain and enhance our engineering design  our certification and program management capabilities and our ability to effectively use our recent acquisitions to manufacture a broader range of structural components  connectors and fasteners used in this business 
if we are unable to manufacture quality products and to deliver our products on time  we may be subject to increased costs or loss of customers or orders  which could reduce our results of operations during the latter part of fiscal and throughout fiscal  we experienced significant operating inefficiencies in our seating programs which resulted in delayed deliveries to customers  increased re work of seating products  claims for warranty  penalties  out of sequence charges  substantial increases in air freight and other expedite related costs 
in addition  as a result of our late customer deliveries  certain airlines diverted their seating programs to other manufacturers 
to the extent we suffer any of these inefficiencies or shortcomings in the future we will likely experience significant penalties and loss of customers 
our acquisition strategy may be less successful than we expect and therefore  our growth may be limited we intend to consider future acquisitions 
we intend to consider future strategic acquisitions  some of which could be material to us and which may include companies that are substantially equivalent or larger in size compared to us 
we continually explore and conduct discussions with many third parties regarding possible acquisitions 
as of the date of this form k  we have no acquisition agreements to acquire any business or assets 
our ability to continue to achieve our goals may depend upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire attractive companies  to effectively integrate such companies  achieve cost efficiencies and to manage these businesses as part of our company 
we may not be able to effectively manage or integrate the acquired companies 
further  we may not be successful in implementing appropriate operational  financial and management systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from these acquisitions 
our efforts to integrate these businesses could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control  such as regulatory developments  general economic conditions  increased competition and the loss of certain customers resulting from the acquisitions 
in addition  the process of integrating these businesses could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of our existing business and the loss of key personnel and customers 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the transition and integration of these businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
further  the benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions may not develop 
we will have to finance any future acquisitions 
depending upon the acquisition opportunities available  we may need to raise additional funds or arrange for additional bank financing 
we may seek such additional funds through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or bank loans 
issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in substantial dilution to stockholders 
the incurrence of additional indebtedness by us could have adverse consequences to stockholders as described above 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to make future acquisitions in accordance with our business strategy  to absorb adverse operating results  to fund capital expenditures or to respond to changing business and economic conditions may be adversely affected  all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there are risks inherent in international operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business operations our operations are primarily in the united states  with approximately of our sales during the transition period ended december  coming from our foreign operations in the united kingdom and the netherlands 
while the majority of our operations are based domestically  each of our facilities sells to airlines all over the world 
as a result  or more of our consolidated sales for the past three fiscal years were to airlines located outside the united states 
we have direct investments in a number of subsidiaries in foreign countries primarily in europe 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies affect the dollar value of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries  with these fluctuations being included in a separate component of stockholders equity 
operating results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at average monthly exchange rates 
at december   we reported a cumulative foreign currency translation amount of in stockholders equity as a result of foreign currency adjustments  and we may incur additional adjustments in future periods 
in addition  the us dollar value of transactions based in foreign currency collections on foreign sales or payments for foreign purchases also fluctuates with exchange rates 
if in the future a substantial majority of our sales were not denominated in the currency of the country of product origin  we could face increased currency risk 
also  changes in the value of the us dollar or other currencies could result in fluctuations in foreign currency translation amounts or the us dollar value of transactions and  as a result  our net earnings could be adversely affected 
our largest foreign currency exposure results from activity in euros and british pounds 
we may engage in hedging transactions in the future to manage or reduce our foreign exchange risk 
however  our attempts to manage our foreign currency exchange risk may not be successful and  as a result  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our foreign operations could also be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other market barriers and political and economic instability in the countries where we operate 
due to our foreign operations we could be subject to such factors in the future and the impact of any such events that may occur in the future could subject us to additional costs or loss of sales  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our total assets include substantial intangible assets 
the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets 
at december   goodwill and identified intangibles  net  represented approximately of total assets and of stockholders equity 
intangible assets consist of goodwill and other identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions  representing the excess of cost over the fair value of tangible assets we have acquired since we may not be able to realize the value of these assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but are reviewed at least annually for impairment 
acquired intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their individual useful lives 
in addition to goodwill  our intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of the m m trademark 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the goodwill and trademark with indefinite lives that were being amortized over periods ranging from to years follow the non amortization approach beginning february  patents and other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from three to thirty years see note to our consolidated financial statements 
on at least an annual basis  we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of intangible assets 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities of the related business  an impairment is deemed to have occurred 
in this event  the amount is written down accordingly 
under current accounting rules  this would result in a charge of operating earnings 
any determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized goodwill and identified intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization  which could be material 
as of december   we have determined that no impairment existed 
risks associated with our capital stock provisions in our charter documents may discourage potential acquisitions of our company  even those which the holders of a majority of our common stock may favor our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition of us by means of a tender offer  proxy contest or otherwise 
our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws o classify the board of directors into three classes  with directors of each class serving for a staggered three year period  o provide that directors may be removed only for cause and only upon the approval of the holders of at least two thirds of the voting power of our shares entitled to vote generally in the election of such directors  o require at least two thirds of the voting power of our shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to alter  amend or repeal the provisions relating to the classified board and removal of directors described above  o permit the board of directors to fill vacancies and newly created directorships on the board  o restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings  and o contain advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals 
such provisions would make the removal of incumbent directors more difficult and time consuming and may have the effect of discouraging a tender offer or other takeover attempt not previously approved by the board of directors 
our board of directors has declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of common stock outstanding 
a right will also be attached to each share of common stock subsequently issued 
the rights will have certain anti takeover effects 
if triggered  the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons that acquires more than of our common stock on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the rights could discourage or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or other similar transaction 
under our restated certificate of incorporation  our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers  preferences and rights of any such series without stockholder approval 
the board of directors could  therefore  issue  without stockholder approval  preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us 
in addition  under certain circumstances  section of the delaware general corporation law makes it more difficult for an interested stockholder  or generally a stockholder  to effect various business combinations with a corporation for a three year period 
you may not receive cash dividends on our shares we have never paid a cash dividend and do not plan to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we intended to retain our earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business and to repay indebtedness 
also  our ability to declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock is restricted by covenants in our outstanding notes and amended bank credit facility 
if the price of our common stock continues to fluctuate significantly  you could lose all or a part of your investment since the beginning of the transition period ending on december   the closing price of our common stock has ranged from a low of to a high of 
the price of our common stock is subject to sudden and material increases and decreases  and decreases could adversely affect investments in our common stock 
the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to o our quarterly operating results  o changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  o changes in our credit ratings  o changes in our business  o changes in the market s perception of our business  o changes in the businesses  earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors or customers  o changes in the outlook for the airline industry  o changes in general market or economic conditions  o changes in the legislative or regulatory environment  o a prolonged war with iraq or other outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities  and o terrorist attacks 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies  including companies in our industry 
the changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance 
the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates affecting the cost of our variable rate debt 
foreign currency we have direct operations in europe that receive revenues from customers in various currencies and purchase raw materials and component parts from foreign vendors in various currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
the largest foreign currency exposure results from activity in british pounds and euros 
from time to time  we and our foreign subsidiaries may enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage risk on transactions conducted in foreign currencies 
at december   we had no outstanding forward currency exchange contracts 
we did not enter into any other derivative financial instruments 
interest rates at december   we had adjustable rate debt of and fixed rate debt of the weighted average interest rate for the adjustable and fixed rate debt was approximately and  respectively  at december  if interest rates were to increase by above current rates  the estimate impact on our financial statements would be to reduce pretax income by approximately we do not engage in transactions intended to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we maintained a portfolio of securities consisting mainly of taxable  interest bearing deposits with weighted average maturities of less than three months 
if short term interest rates were to increase or decrease by  we estimate interest income would increase or decrease by approximately
