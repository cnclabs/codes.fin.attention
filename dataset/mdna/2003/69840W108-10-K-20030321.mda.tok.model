the company performs its impairment assessment by comparing discounted cash flows from acquired businesses with the carrying value of the underlying net assets inclusive of goodwill 
in performing this analysis  management considers such factors as current results  trends  future prospects and other economic factors 
no event has been identified that would indicate an impairment in the value of the company s intangible assets

we utilize third party actuarial experts estimates of expected losses based on statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as our own estimates based on our actual historical data 
these assumptions are closely reviewed  monitored  and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances
