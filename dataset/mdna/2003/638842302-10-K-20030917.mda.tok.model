item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand our financial condition and results of operations for the last three fiscal years ended june  you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item in this report 
our future financial condition and results of operations will vary from our historical financial condition and results of operations described below 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included under item in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and their accompanying notes 
we have identified certain policies that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we base our estimates on our historical experience  industry standards  and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an adverse effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations could occur if circumstances change that alter the various assumptions or conditions used in such estimates or assumptions 
our critical accounting policies include those listed below 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from any inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab sab requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized there is evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue upon determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
the criteria are usually met at the time title passes to the customer  which usually occurs upon shipment 
revenue from shipments where title passes upon delivery are deferred until the shipment has been delivered 
in addition  we record reductions to revenue for estimated returns 
if actual returns exceed our estimates  additional reductions to revenue would result 
inventory reserve we record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
if demand and or market conditions are less favorable than we estimated  additional inventory reserves may be required 
depreciation of long lived assets we assign useful lives for long lived assets based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and the intended use for those assets 
any change in the asset lives would be reported in the statement of operations as soon as practicable after we determine any change in the estimate 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as property and equipment depreciation  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or results from final tax examination reviews 
at june   we assessed the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on the historical operating losses and the uncertainty about sufficient near term taxable income  we believe that this evidence creates sufficient uncertainty about the realizability of the net deferred tax assets 
therefore  a full valuation allowance of million is recorded at june  should we determine that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax assets to operations in the period for which such determination was made 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands private label contract manufacturing direct to consumer marketing program total net sales our total net sales increased in fiscal net sales from our direct to consumer marketing program increased 
this increase in fiscal was due primarily to the introduction of five new direct to consumer products 
total net sales for all private label contract manufacturing customers with individual volumes of at least million was million three customers in fiscal and million four customers in fiscal this represents an increase of million  which was primarily due to new product sales together with an increase in the volume of established products for our two largest customers 
gross profit fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands gross profit as a percentage of net sales the improvement in gross profit margin to from was due to fixed cost leverage from higher net sales and improved efficiency from investments in our packaging operations 
our direct and indirect manufacturing expenses were of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal our material and packaging costs as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal million and in fiscal million 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal and million of net sales in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal was primarily due to increases in direct to consumer fulfillment and recurring media costs of  associated with incremental sales  new direct to consumer media and production costs of  for introducing dr 
cherry s pathway to healing tm brand in several new television markets  sales and executive personnel costs of  research and development personnel costs of  insurance premiums of  information system costs of  and clinical study costs of  these increases were partially offset by a  reduction in legal costs   reduction in employee separation expenses  and  reduction of direct to consumer costs incurred in the prior year for improving customer service  processing and reporting 

table of contents income from operations our income from operations was million in fiscal and  in fiscal the improvement in our income from operations was due to the increase in gross profit of million from improved gross margin on higher net sales  partially offset by incremental selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
other income we received proceeds from the settlement of claims associated with the vitamin antitrust litigation of  in fiscal and million in fiscal income taxes in fiscal  federal tax legislation was passed allowing companies to carryback net operating losses for five years 
this resulted in recognition of a  income tax refund receivable  which was included as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  at june   we assessed the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
based on the historical operating losses and the uncertainty about sufficient near term taxable income  we believe that this evidence creates sufficient uncertainty about the realizability of the net deferred tax assets 
therefore  a full valuation allowance of million was recorded at june  net income our net income was million per diluted share in fiscal and million per diluted share in fiscal excluding the effect of the litigation settlement proceeds and income tax refund receivable of  in the prior year  net income increased million to  per diluted share compared to a net loss of  per diluted share 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands private label contract manufacturing direct to consumer marketing program total net sales our total net sales increased in fiscal net sales from our direct to consumer marketing program increased 
this increase was due primarily to the introduction of eight new direct to consumer products in fiscal total net sales for all private label contract manufacturing customers with individual volumes of at least million was million four customers in fiscal and million six customers in fiscal this represents an increase of million  which was primarily due to new product sales together with an increase in the volume of established products to our two largest customers 
gross profit fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands gross profit as a percentage of net sales sales increases in both our private label contract manufacturing business and our direct to consumer marketing program favorably impacted our gross profit in fiscal our direct and indirect manufacturing expenses were of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal this reduction was due to improved internal process controls and increased efficiency 

table of contents our material and packaging costs as a percentage of net sales were relatively steady at million in fiscal and million in fiscal material contribution margins decreased in fiscal due to material costs for our packaged powder products 
excluding the packaged powder products  material costs as a percentage of net sales would have improved due to our cost reduction efforts 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal and million of net sales in fiscal the increase in absolute dollar terms in fiscal was primarily due to incremental spending for our direct to consumer marketing program of million  and spending of  to reorganize our manufacturing and sales organizations 
in addition  lower than expected performance by our former third party provider of direct to consumer call and fulfillment services resulted in significantly higher processing and customer service costs 
we replaced the third party provider in december and began an aggressive campaign to improve customer service 
this resulted in additional charges of approximately  the start up costs of our direct to consumer call and fulfillment center were approximately  total operating expenses were comparable in absolute dollar terms at approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal operating expenses in fiscal included a charge of million 
this charge reflected a write down for intangible assets and additional expenses associated with our attempt to commercialize the software we obtained from our fitnessage and custom nutrition ventures 
income loss from operations our income from operations was  in fiscal in fiscal  we suffered a loss of million 
the improvement in our income from operations was primarily due to the increase in gross profit of million in fiscal and the intangible asset impairment charge of million recorded in other income we received proceeds from the settlement of claims associated with the vitamin antitrust litigation of million in fiscal and  in fiscal income taxes our income tax expense for fiscal was million  resulting from the establishment of a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  federal tax legislation was passed allowing companies to carryback net operating losses for five years 
this resulted in recognition of a  income tax refund receivable  which was included as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  net income loss our net income was million per share in fiscal in fiscal  we suffered a net loss of million per share 
the improvement in our net income was due to improved operating results  the vitamin antitrust litigation settlement  and the income tax benefit described above 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital increased substantially in fiscal to million at june  versus million at june  cash and cash equivalents increased million as a result of the new credit facility  as discussed below  collection of the income tax refund of  and cash generated from operations 
the new credit facility provided a million increase in our cash position and freed up million of cash previously restricted as collateral for the prior line of credit 
accounts receivable increased million due to higher net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared with the same period in the prior fiscal year and an increase in days sales outstanding 
accounts payable as a percentage of inventory was at june  versus at june  due to timing of payments 

table of contents approximately of our operating cash flow was generated by naie in fiscal there are currently no material restrictions on the transfer of these funds within the company 
capital expenditures for fiscal were approximately  these expenditures were for investments in our continuing development of the swiss manufacturing facility of approximately  and domestic manufacturing and information system improvements of approximately  the domestic capital expenditures were primarily for improving our finished goods packaging operation 
we plan on increasing capital expenditures in fiscal by greater than to expand capacity in encapsulation and packaging operations 
our consolidated debt increased to million at june  from million at june  our consolidated debt of million was comprised of a  term loan secured by a building and million outstanding on the term loan included in our new credit facility 
on october   we entered into a million two year credit facility 
the facility includes a million working capital line of credit and a million term loan and is secured by all of our assets 
the working capital line of credit is subject to eligibility requirements for current accounts receivable and inventory balances 
as of june   we had million available under the line of credit 
the interest rate on the line of credit and the term loan is prime plus 
this new facility replaced our previous million line of credit that expired on october  and refinanced a million outstanding term note 
in fiscal we plan on funding normal working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt payments using cash flow from operations 
on june  we purchased option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange risk inherent in our forecasted transactions denominated in euros 
the option contracts had a notional amount of million and a purchase price of  the premium associated with each option contract is amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the option  and mark to market amounts and realized gains or losses are recognized on the settlement date in cost of good sold 
the risk of loss associated with purchased options is limited to premium amounts paid for the option contracts 
at june   the value of the purchased options of  was included in other current assets in the consolidated financial statements 
there are no other derivative financial instruments at june  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt nor do we have any transactions  arrangements or relationships with any special purposes entities 
contractual obligations this table summarizes our known contractual obligations and commercial commitments at june  dollars in thousands 
contractual obligations total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter long term debt operating lease total obligations 
table of contents inflation we do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our historical operations or profitability 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin is applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  fin expands the existing disclosure required for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
fin also requires a company to recognize an initial liability for the fair market value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee upon issuance and disclosure of certain information about the guarantee in its interim and annual financial statements 
we do not expect this interpretation to have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  sfas provides an alternative method of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes accounting for its stock based employee compensation to the fair value method 
in addition  sfas changes the disclosure provisions to provide more prominent disclosures about the effects on reported net income with respect to stock based employee compensation and adds additional disclosures relating to stock based employee compensation for interim financial information 
we have made the required disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
however  we do not plan to change the accounting for our employee stock based compensation at this time 
in january  fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin is effective for variable interest entities created after january  fin is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
we do not expect this interpretation to have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in april  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

in particular  sfas clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative  clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  and amends the definition of underlying to conform it to language used in fin sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  we do not expect this interpretation to have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how to classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity

risks you should carefully consider the risks described below  as well as the other information in this report  when evaluating our business and future prospects 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or a portion of the value of your investment in our common stock 

table of contents because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers  our revenues would be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer 
we have in the past  and expect to continue in the near future  to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a relatively limited number of customers 
during the fiscal year ended june   sales to one customer  nsa international  inc  were approximately of our total net sales 
our second largest customer was mannatech incorporated  which accounted for approximately of our net sales 
the loss of either of these customers or other major customers  or a significant decrease in sales to these customers  would materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results will vary and there is no guarantee that we will earn a profit 
fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect the share price of our common stock 
while our net sales and income from operations have both improved during the past two fiscal years  there can be no assurance that they will continue to improve  or that we will earn a profit in any given year 
we have experienced losses in the recent past and may incur losses in the future 
our operating results may fluctuate from year to year due to various factors including differences related to the timing of revenues and expenses for financial reporting purposes and other factors described in this report 
at times  these fluctuations may be significant 
fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect the share price of our common stock 
a significant or prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our results of operations are affected by the level of business activity of our customers  which in turn is affected by the level of consumer demand for their products 
a significant or prolonged economic downturn may adversely affect the disposable income of many consumers and may lower demand for the products we produce for our private label contract manufacturing customers  as well as for our direct to consumer products 
a decline in consumer demand and the level of business activity of our customers due to economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins 
because our direct to consumer sales rely on the marketability of key personalities  the inability of a key personality to perform his or her role or the existence of negative publicity surrounding a key personality may adversely affect our revenues 
our direct to consumer products have been a growing part of our business 
for the fiscal year ended june   our direct to consumer products accounted for of our net sales 
these products are marketed with a key personality through a variety of distribution channels 
the inability or failure of a key personality to fulfill his or her role as a spokesperson for a product  a reduction in the exposure of a key personality or negative publicity about a key personality may adversely affect the sales of our product associated with that personality and could affect the sale of other products 
a decline in sales would negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively 
increased competition could adversely affect our financial condition 
the market for our products is highly competitive 
many of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources and broader name recognition than we do 
our larger competitors may be able to devote greater resources to research and development  marketing and other activities that could provide them with a competitive advantage 
our market has relatively low entry barriers and is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products that may rapidly capture a significant market share 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced gross profit margins or loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete in this intensely competitive environment 
we may not be able to raise additional capital or obtain additional financing if needed 
our cash from operations may not be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and or to implement our business strategies 
although we obtained a new million two year line of credit in october  there can be no 
table of contents assurance that this line of credit will be sufficient to meet our needs 
furthermore  if we fail to maintain certain loan covenants we will no longer have access to the credit line 
as a result  we may need to raise additional capital or obtain additional financing 
in recent years  it has been difficult for companies to raise capital due to a variety of factors including the overall poor performance of the stock markets and the economic slowdown in the united states and other countries 
thus  there is no assurance we would be able to raise additional capital if needed 
to the extent we do raise additional capital  the ownership position of existing shareholders could be diluted 
similarly  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available if needed or that it will be available on favorable terms 
our inability to raise additional capital or to obtain additional financing if needed would negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategies and meet our goals 
this  in turn  would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the failure of our suppliers to supply materials in sufficient quantities  at a favorable price  and in a timely fashion could adversely affect the results of our operations 
we buy our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers 
during fiscal  carrington laboratories incorporated was our largest supplier  accounting for of our total raw material purchases 
the loss of carrington laboratories incorporated or other major supplier could adversely affect our business operations 
although we believe that we could establish alternate sources for most of our raw materials  any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product shortages and back orders for our products  with a resulting loss of sales and customers 
in certain situations we may be required to alter our products or to substitute different materials from alternative sources 
a shortage of raw materials or an unexpected interruption of supply could also result in higher prices for those materials 
although we may be able to raise our prices in response to significant increases in the cost of raw materials  we may not be able to raise prices sufficiently or quickly enough to offset the negative effects of the cost increases on our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that suppliers will provide the raw materials needed by us in the quantities requested or at a price we are willing to pay 
because we do not control the actual production of these raw materials  we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production of materials based on conditions outside of our control  including weather  transportation interruptions  strikes by supplier employees  and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
we rely solely on one supplier to process certain raw materials that we use in the product line of our largest customer 
the loss of or unexpected interruption in this service would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity  which could negatively affect our sales and revenues 
our business can be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception about our industry  our competitors  or our business generally 
this adverse publicity may include publicity about the nutritional supplements industry generally  the safety and quality of nutritional supplements and personal care products or ingredients in general or our products or ingredients specifically  and regulatory investigations  regardless of whether these investigations involve us or the business practices or products of our competitors 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid any adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future 
any adverse publicity or negative public perception will likely have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business  financial condition and results of operations also could be adversely affected if any of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies are alleged to be or are proved to be harmful to consumers or to have unanticipated health consequences 
we could be exposed to product liability claims or other litigation  which may be costly and could materially adversely affect our operations 
we could face financial liability due to product liability claims if the use of our products results in significant loss or injury 
additionally  the manufacture and sale of our products involves the risk of injury to consumers from 
table of contents tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination 
we could be exposed to future product liability claims that  among others our products contain contaminants  we provide consumers with inadequate instructions about product use  or we provide inadequate warning about side effects or interactions of our products with other substances 
we maintain product liability insurance coverage  including primary product liability and excess liability coverage 
the cost of this coverage has increased dramatically in recent years  while the availability of adequate insurance coverage has decreased 
there can be no assurance that product liability insurance will continue to be available at an economically reasonable cost or that our insurance will be adequate to cover any liability we may incur 
additionally  it is possible that one or more of our insurers could exclude from our coverage certain ingredients used in our products 
in such event  we may have to stop using those ingredients or rely on indemnification or similar arrangements with our customers who wish to continue to include those ingredients in their products 
a substantial increase in our product liability risk or the loss of customers or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
as we continue to expand into markets outside the united states our business becomes increasingly subject to political and economic risks in those markets  which could adversely affect our business 
our future growth may depend  in part  on our ability to continue to expand into markets outside the united states 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to expand our presence in our existing markets outside the united states  enter new markets on a timely basis  or that new markets outside the united states will be profitable 
there are significant regulatory and legal barriers in markets outside the united states that we must overcome 
we will be subject to the burden of complying with a wide variety of national and local laws  including multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting laws 
we also may experience difficulties adapting to new cultures  business customs and legal systems 
our sales and operations outside the united states are subject to political  economic and social uncertainties including  among others changes and limits in import and export controls  increases in custom duties and tariffs  changes in government regulations and laws  coordination of geographically separated locations  absence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights  changes in currency exchange rates  economic and political instability  and currency transfer and other restrictions and regulations that may limit our ability to sell certain products or repatriate profits to the united states 
any changes related to these and other factors could adversely affect our business  profitability and growth prospects 
as we continue to expand into markets outside the united states  these and other risks associated with operations outside the united states are likely to increase 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulation  which could limit or prevent the sale of our products in some markets and could increase our costs 
the manufacturing  packaging  labeling  advertising  promotion  distribution  and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the united states and in other countries 
failure to comply with fda regulations may result in  among other things  injunctions  product withdrawals  recalls  product seizures  fines  and criminal prosecutions 
any action of this type by the fda could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 
in addition  if the ftc has reason to believe the law is being violated for example  if it believes we do not possess adequate substantiation for product claims  it can initiate an enforcement action 
ftc enforcement could result in orders requiring  among other things  limits on advertising  consumer redress  divestiture of assets  rescission of contracts  and such other relief as may be deemed necessary 
violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties 
any action by the ftc could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products 

table of contents in markets outside the united states  before commencing operations or marketing our products  we may be required to obtain approvals  licenses  or certifications from a country s ministry of health or comparable agency 
approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of products or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients 
we must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country 
furthermore  the regulations of these countries may conflict with those in the united states and with each other 
the sale of our products in europe is subject to the rules and regulations of the european union  which may be interpreted differently among the countries within the union 
the cost of complying with these various and potentially conflicting regulations can be substantial and can adversely affect our results of operations 
we cannot predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations  or applications  nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders  when and if adopted  would have on our business 
they could include requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  the recall or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping  expanded or different labeling  and additional scientific substantiation 
any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel  our business will suffer 
our executive officers and other management personnel are primarily responsible for our day to day operations 
we believe our success depends largely on our ability to attract  maintain and motivate highly qualified management personnel 
competition for qualified individuals can be intense  and we may not be able to hire additional qualified personnel in a timely manner and on reasonable terms 
we employed the majority of our current executive officers in fiscal and our inability to retain a skilled professional management team could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our business strategy and achieve our goals 
our manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks 
we currently manufacture the vast majority of our products at our manufacturing facilities in california 
as a result  we are dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of that facility 
our manufacturing operations are subject to power failures  the breakdown  failure or substandard performance of equipment  the improper installation or operation of equipment  natural or other disasters  and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of governmental agencies  including the fda 
while we maintain business interruption insurance  there can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facilities in california or at naie s facility in switzerland would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that our insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost or  if available  will be adequate to cover any losses that we may incur from an interruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
we possess and may possess in the future certain proprietary technology  trade secrets  trademarks  tradenames and similar intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our intellectual property adequately 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
litigation in the united states or abroad may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement 
this litigation  even if successful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
if any such claims are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under the third party s intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance  however  that a license would be available on terms acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
collectively  our officers and directors own a significant amount of our common stock  giving them influence over corporate transactions and other matters and potentially limiting the influence of other shareholders on important policy and management issues 
our officers and directors  together with their families and affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock as of june  as a result  our officers and directors could influence such 
table of contents business matters as the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
various transactions could be delayed  deferred or prevented without the approval of shareholders  including transactions resulting in a change in control  mergers and acquisitions  tender offers  election of directors  and proxy contests 
there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to the officers and directors who own shares of our common stock or that conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to us or our other shareholders 
if certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law are triggered  the future price investors might be willing to pay for our common stock could be limited 
certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware corporate law help discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire our business  even if the proposal benefits our shareholders 
our board of directors is authorized  without shareholder approval  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock having such rights  preferences  and privileges  including voting rights  as the board designates 
the rights of our common stockholders will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
any or all of these provisions could delay  deter or prevent a takeover of our company and could limit the price investors are willing to pay for our common stock 
our stock price could fluctuate significantly 
our stock price has been volatile in recent years 
the trading price of our stock could be subject to fluctuations in response to broad market fluctuations and general economic conditions  fluctuations in our financial results  future offerings of our common stock or other securities  the general condition of the nutritional supplement industry  increased competition  regulatory action  adverse publicity  and product and other public announcements 
the stock market has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that an active market in our stock will continue to exist or that the price of our common stock will not decline 
our future operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we generally do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments and do not buy investments as hedges or for purposes other than trading that are likely to expose us to certain types of market risk  including interest rate  commodity price  or equity price risk 
we may  however  buy certain investments to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate exposures 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our credit facility established on october  as of june  the credit facility was million of our total outstanding debt 
the interest rate on the credit facility is equal to prime plus  and was as of june  the remaining outstanding debt of  at june  has a fixed interest rate 
an immediate adverse change of one hundred basis points in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by  interest rates have been at or near historic lows in recent years 
there can be no guarantee that interest rates will not rise 
any increase in interest rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we are also exposed to changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
to the extent our business continues to expand outside the united states  an increasing share of our net sales and cost of sales will be transacted in currencies other than the united states dollar 
accounting practices require that our non united states dollar denominated transactions be converted to united states dollars for reporting purposes 
consequently  our reported net earnings may be significantly effected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
when the united states dollar strengthens against currencies in which products are sold or weakens against currencies in which we incur costs  net sales and costs could be adversely effected 
we are exposed to the risk of fluctuation in the exchange rate between the swiss franc and the united states dollar given naie s operations in switzerland  and between the euro and the united states dollar as nsa international  inc  our largest customer  pays naie in euros 
on june   the swiss franc closed at to united states dollar and the euro closed at to us dollar 
a adverse change to the exchange rate between both the swiss franc and the united states dollar and the euro and the united states dollar would have decreased our earnings by  our goal in managing foreign currency risk is to help provide reasonable certainty to the functional currency value of foreign currency cash flows and to help stabilize the value of non united states dollar denominated earnings 
to hedge our foreign currency risk  we may enter into forward exchange contracts  foreign currency borrowing  and option contracts
