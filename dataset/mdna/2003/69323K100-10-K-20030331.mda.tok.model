at march   the carrying values of the company s financial instruments approximated their fair values based on current market prices and rates

the variable interest rate on the line of credit is tied to the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate at the discretion of the company

the company believes that the effect of any change in interest rates will not be material to the company s financial position
