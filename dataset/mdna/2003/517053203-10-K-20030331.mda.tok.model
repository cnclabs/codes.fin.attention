table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in part iv of this report 
this discussion includes forward looking statements  such as our projections about future results of operations that are inherently uncertain 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors including  but not limited to  those discussed in factors that may affect our business in this item 
overview the company s financial position and results of operations are summarized as follows between  the company s revenues were almost entirely earned from a research collaboration with the dow chemical company and its subsidiary  dow agrosciences llc  or collectively  dow 
under our agreement with dow  the company received funding for sponsored genomics research and payments for technology access rights and milestone achievements 
we earned over million in revenue from this collaboration  representing at least of our total revenues in each year between and this research collaboration ended in august we do not currently have any research collaborations with revenue similar to our agreement with dow 
additionally  certain of our key products including the nhl vaccine and alpha galactosidase a enzyme replacement therapy have remaining development periods extending past as such  we believe that in order for us to realize significant revenue growth in  we must pursue a number of revenue sources including new collaborations  government contracts and grants  biomanufacturing supply agreements  other product sales  and license fees 
the company incurred negative operating cash flows of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
this increasingly negative trend of operating cash flows is primarily attributable to the completion of the dow collaboration in august and the lack of significant revenues from other collaborators or customers over the three year period 
we expect to continue realizing material negative operating cash flows until  and if  we begin generating significant revenues 
our working capital balance equaled million at december  based upon our net operating cash usage of million in the fourth quarter of  we believe that our working capital is sufficient to support our current level of operations through at least march  however  we expect to reduce our current rate of cash usage based upon cost savings initiatives that we expect to implement in we may begin realizing such cost savings in the second quarter of absent material reductions in our cash operating expenses  the company s ability to continue as a going concern significantly beyond march  depends on our ability to generate significant revenues and or pursue other potential sources of working capital including partnerships  mergers or sales of assets or technologies 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that we will realize significant revenue growth or reduce our operating costs  or that other sources of working capital will be available to the company 
results of operations revenues revenues decreased million  or  in and million  or  in these decreases are primarily attributable to the completion of our research collaboration with dow in august and the lack of significant revenues from other collaborators or 
table of contents customers since that time 
revenues from dow equaled million and million in and  respectively 
one of our material revenue generating contracts as of december  was terminated by us in the first quarter of while we expect to generate new revenue sources in  based solely upon our other revenue generating contracts as of december   we expect revenues in to be slightly higher than development agreement costs development agreement costs consist mainly of personnel expenses and research materials related to activities performed under revenue generating research agreements 
development agreement costs decreased million  or  in and million  or  in these decreases are primarily attributable to the completion of our research collaboration with dow in august we expect future development agreement costs to fluctuate consistently with increases or decreases in revenues earned from new research agreements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist mainly of internal personnel  consulting and outside research services  and materials related to unreimbursed research activities 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  in and increased million  or  in the decrease in is primarily attributable to a company wide restructuring in june that reduced the company s headcount by as well as the cancellation of certain consulting and outside research services 
the increase in was primarily attributable to the reallocation of resources from activities associated with the dow research collaboration to internally funded research projects 
for reporting purposes  this reallocation of resources resulted in increased research and development expenses and decreased development agreement costs 
the increase in was also due to the hiring of additional research personnel and increased facility costs related to the company s proteomics division 
we expect research and development expenses in to be lower than as a result of our past and continuing cost reduction efforts 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in  and increased million  or  in excluding million of nonrecurring charges in for headcount reductions  and write downs of property and equipment  and capitalized patent costs  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in the decrease in is primarily attributable to a company wide restructuring in june that reduced the company s headcount by 
the increase in was attributable to several factors including personnel additions and consulting services related to business development and public and investor relations activities commencing in  personnel additions and production costs related to regulatory and shareholder reporting requirements after the company s ipo in august  greater outside legal costs related to an increased volume of patent applications in  and increased facility costs related to the company s proteomics division 
we expect general and administrative expenses in to be lower than as a result of our past and continuing cost reduction efforts 
impairment of goodwill we concluded at december  that our goodwill balance was fully impaired given the fair value of our proteomics division was determined to be less than its carrying value 
we recognized an  charge in to write off the remaining balance of goodwill 
stock compensation bonus the non cash charge of million in related to stock options issued to certain company officers and employees in december that vested concurrent with the company s ipo in august 
table of contents amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles amortization expense relates to the company s purchase of large scale proteomics corporation proteomics in amortization expense decreased  in as goodwill and certain purchased intangibles were no longer amortized effective january  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
amortization expense in of our proteomics purchased intangibles will equal  interest income interest income decreased million in and increased  in the decrease in is attributable to the company s declining cash and marketable securities balances available for investment and significant reductions in interest yields throughout and the increase in was attributable to a full year of investment of the available proceeds from the company s ipo in august we expect interest income in to be lower than change in fair value of warrant the non cash charge of  in related to an increase in the fair value of a warrant issued to dow in connection with our research agreement 
we reclassified the warrant from a liability to stockholders equity in and no subsequent charges were incurred 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the company s usage of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in  and year ended december  net cash used in operating activities  excluding marketable securities activities cash used in investing activities  excluding marketable securities activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at beginning of year cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at end of year as noted below  we progressively improved our operating cash flows in however  our current rate of cash usage is not sustainable for a long term period compared to our balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  given our current financial condition and recent financial performance  we believe our ability to attract additional working capital through equity or debt issuance is limited 
we may have opportunities to enter into partnerships with other companies to support the development of specified products 
however  such support would likely not be available to all of our research projects 
accordingly  we must fund our current liquidity needs through significant improvements in our operating cash flows 
such improvement is primarily dependent on our ability to generate significant revenue growth in our liquidity needs may adversely affect our product development efforts 
we have delayed further clinical trials of our nhl vaccine until such time as we secure funding from a partner 
if 
table of contents we are unsuccessful in partnering the cost of these clinical trials  further development of this product may be delayed indefinitely 
we are also pursuing a partner to fund the clinical trials of our alpha galactosidase a product 
we may also delay other key products or technologies currently under development 
delays incurred in the development of our products may impair our ability to generate new sources of revenue 
net cash used in operating activities  excluding marketable securities activities the company s quarterly operating cash usage is set forth below quarter ended net cash used in operating activities  excluding marketable securities activities march june september december includes million in restructuring related disbursements 
in  we reduced our operating cash usage by between the first quarter and the fourth quarter 
the improvement in our operating cash usage is primarily attributable to cost reductions in both research and development activities and general and administrative activities 
additionally  new sources of revenue in resulted in increased revenues each quarter in from  in the first quarter to  in the fourth quarter 
we expect to realize negative operating cash flows in the year ended december  although lower in amount than cash used in investing activities  excluding marketable securities activities capital expenditures equaled  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we invested million in our proteomics division  primarily for leasehold improvements to a new and expanded research facility in maryland 
in addition  we invested million in our biomanufacturing division for continued construction of our biomanufacturing plant in kentucky 
our capital expenditures primarily related to the completion of construction of our biomanufacturing plant 
the company had no material capital expenditure commitments at december  we believe the infrastructure and capacity of our research facilities in california and maryland and our biomanufacturing plant in kentucky are sufficient to support the company s business objectives in the near term 
accordingly  we do not expect significant amounts of capital expenditures in however  our projection may change based upon the requirements of any new research or biomanufacturing supply agreements that we may enter 
in  we paid million in license fees for the rights to utilize specified intellectual property for future periods 
the company may enter into additional licensing agreements in the future when acquiring rights to certain technologies creates product development opportunities 
net cash provided used in by financing activities the improvement in cash flows from financing activities in compared to is primarily attributable to lower debt repayments which equaled  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  the company received net proceeds of million from our ipo 

table of contents commitments set forth below is a summary of the company s non cancelable commitments to make minimum payments under contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases research agreements license agreements total the company leases facilities in vacaville  california and germantown  maryland under operating leases 
the company has research sponsorship agreements with major universities  government institutions or other companies whereby the company funds specific projects of interest to the company 
in addition to the future non cancelable minimum payments above  certain of the research agreements require future aggregate payments of  if the agreements are not cancelled 
the company does not have any capital lease obligations  purchase obligations or other long term liabilities 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are explained in note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this report 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical given they involve estimates and judgments made by management and are important for our investors understanding of our operating results and financial condition 
revenue recognition we earn revenues from several sources including research and collaboration agreements and government grants that consist of one or more revenue sources including technology access fees  milestone payments and research funding  license fees  and royalties 
we recognize revenues for each of these components as follows technology access fees are typically up front  non refundable payments and represent consideration from our collaboration partners for access and rights to the company s technologies for the term of the research agreement 
the company s technologies are normally integral to the objectives of the research collaboration and  therefore  receipt of a technology access fee does not represent the culmination of an earnings process 
accordingly  we recognize revenue from technology access fees on a straight line basis over the original term of the agreement  not including renewal periods unless renewal is assured at the time the agreement is executed 
the unrecognized portion of technology access fees is reported as deferred revenue 
milestone payments are triggered by the company s achievement of performance objectives that are defined in research agreements 
milestone achievements typically require acceptance or approval by our collaboration partners 
also  our collaboration partners retain access to the technologies underlying the milestone achievement for the remaining term of the agreement 
accordingly  we recognize revenue from milestone payments on a straight line basis from the date of completion of the applicable performance objective to the end of the original term of the agreement  not including renewal periods unless renewal is assured at the time the agreement is executed 
the unrecognized portion of milestone payments is reported as deferred revenue 

table of contents we receive funding for sponsored research or feasibility studies from commercial companies  government agencies and educational institutions 
funding for sponsored research or feasibility studies is typically non refundable and not based upon performance objectives or customer acceptance 
also  we may receive funding in the form of periodic payments or reimbursement of actual costs 
accordingly  revenue from sponsored research and feasibility studies is recognized using the percentage of completion method or recognized as expenses are incurred depending on the form of funding 
under the percentage of completion method  the total contract value is multiplied by the percentage of actual research costs incurred to date compared to the estimated total costs to complete the contract as a whole 
if collection of any funding is not assured  revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the percentage of completion calculation or actual cash received to date 
revenue received for equipment purchases is deferred and recognized as revenue over the life of the agreement 
we provide licenses to third parties for the exclusive or non exclusive access to certain of the company s technologies for commercial development purposes 
we may receive fees from such licenses in the form of up front payments  additional payments upon achievement of milestones  and royalty rights upon the successful commercialization by the licensee of a product containing the licensed technology 
license agreements normally provide the licensee with immediate access to the company s technology and do not require the company to provide any research services or other support toward the licensee s commercial development efforts 
accordingly  we recognize up front license fees as revenue upon the effective date of the licensee s first access to the company s technologies 
additional license fees payable upon achievement of milestones are recognized as revenue upon such achievement and royalty payments are recognized as revenue when earned by the company 
intangible and long lived assets the company s intangible and long lived assets include capitalized costs of filing patent applications that relate to commercially viable technologies  capitalized license fees for rights to specified intellectual property  and property and equipment related to our research facilities in california and maryland and our biomanufacturing plant in kentucky 
all intangible and long lived assets are amortized or depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives  the estimated period that the assets will generate revenue  or the statutory or contractual term in the case of patents and intellectual property licenses 
estimates of useful lives and periods of expected revenue generation are reviewed periodically for appropriateness and are based upon management s judgment 
we evaluate our intangible assets and our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if any of our intangible assets or long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the amount of impairment to be recognized is equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over the fair value of the assets 
stock based compensation the company normally grants stock options having fixed exercise prices and a fixed number of shares of common stock that may be acquired 
we account for stock options granted to employees and directors  as well as other stock based employee compensation plans  using the intrinsic value method of accounting 
as such  we recognize compensation expense for stock options only if the quoted market value of the company s common stock exceeds the exercise price of the option on the grant date 
any compensation expense realized per the intrinsic value method is amortized over the vesting period of the option 
stock options issued to non employees as consideration for goods or services provided to the company are accounted for under the fair value method  which requires that compensation expense be recognized for all such options 

table of contents inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
factors that may affect our business risks related to our business in an environment of diminished revenue  we may not be able to preserve working capital and extend the viability of the company because we are experiencing diminished revenue and cash flow  we are funding virtually all of our product development initiatives internally 
at the same time  because our cash flow is substantially reduced compared to the last three years  we are experiencing increasing pressure to curtail spending and otherwise reduce costs 
we implemented a major reorganization in june to reduce costs 
if we cannot increase our cash flow in the very near term  we likely will be required to take one or more of the following actions further reorganize our operations  delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs  significantly reduce patent related expenses  effectively foregoing our rights to future technologies or products  obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own  or sell or license the rights to certain of our products or technologies on terms that are worse than we might have been able to obtain in a different environment 
if our cash flows continue to deteriorate or we take significant steps to reduce our expenses  potential collaborators may questions our ability to perform and choose not to do business with us  which would make it harder for us to improve our cash flows 
we have negative cash flow and may not have sufficient cash to continue operations 
or  even if we can continue operations  we may not have sufficient cash to effectively manage our working capital requirements and fund our operations for the period required to achieve profitability 
since our inception  we have never generated enough cash to cover our expenses and we will need to continue to spend substantial funds to continue our product development programs 
we do not know with certainty whether our cash reserves and any cash flows from operations or financing will be sufficient to fund our operations significantly beyond we may be unsuccessful in entering into any new collaboration that results in significant revenues or cash flow 
we have limited cash and credit available  and may be unable to raise additional financing or establish additional lines of credit to meet our anticipated and unanticipated working capital requirements 
our future capital requirements depend upon many factors  including our ability to increase revenues  the number of products we have under development  the timing of  and extent to which we are faced with  unanticipated development or technological challenges or regulatory pressures  our ability to successfully transfer liability for or restructure long term facility leases for facilities that exceed our present capacity needs  and the willingness of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies to partner with us 

table of contents in the event we raise capital via equity financing  our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution  as our stock price is less than and we expect that the amount of additional capital we will require would be substantial 
we may raise this capital through public or private financings or additional collaborations  strategic partnerships or licensing arrangements 
if adequate funds are not available to satisfy either short or long term capital requirements  we might be required to significantly limit or cease our operations or delay or abandon some of our planned future expenditures  any of which actions could harm our business 
if our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on the nasdaq national market  the value and liquidity of your investment may be adversely affected 
we are in danger of being delisted from the nasdaq national market 
on january   we received a notice from the nasdaq qualifications department that indicated that our common stock had closed for consecutive trading days below the applicable minimum bid price of 
under current nasdaq national market listing requirements  we have calendar days from the date of the nasdaq qualification department s notice in which to demonstrate that the market price for our common stock has closed at or above a bid price of per share for at least ten consecutive trading days 
to ensure continued listing on the nasdaq national market  the company must regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and thereafter maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement and the other nasdaq national market listing requirements 
we cannot assure you that we will regain or maintain compliance with these requirements 
if we do not meet these requirements  we expect that our common stock would be traded on the nasdaq smallcap market or the nasd over the counter bulletin board 
in the event of delisting from the nasdaq national market  we expect to pursue listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
further  if we fail to comply with the nasdaq national market listing requirements  the ability of stockholders to buy and sell shares of our common stock might be affected and the efficiency of the trading market for our common stock could significantly impair our ability to raise capital in the public markets should we desire to do so in the future 
in addition  our stock could also potentially be subject to what are known as the penny stock rules  which place additional requirements on broker dealers who sell or make a market in such securities 
consequently  if we were removed from the nasdaq national market  the ability or willingness of broker dealers to sell or make a market in our common stock might decline 
we have a history of losses and cannot predict when we will become profitable  if at all we have had net losses in each year since our inception in we sustained a net loss of million in  and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  from september through august  almost all of our revenues came from our research collaboration with dow 
the research collaboration with dow ended on august  and we expect no additional revenues under our contract with dow for the foreseeable future 
we have not yet entered into any new collaborations of a magnitude that could make up for the decrease in cash flow and revenues resulting from the completion of our research collaboration with dow 
we expect to continue to spend significant amounts to develop products and to fund our operations 
as a result we will need to generate significant additional revenues from collaborations and the commercialization of our products and technologies to achieve profitability 
we expect to incur substantial losses in the foreseeable future 
if we are unable to enter into major new collaborations  control our operating expenses and successfully commercialize our products and technologies  we may never become profitable and we may fail 

table of contents we likely will require additional capital in order for us to develop profitable and cash positive operations  we must generate revenue from our products under development and our technologies 
since our inception  we have never generated enough cash to cover our expenses and we expect to continue to spend substantial funds to continue our product development programs 
in addition  the risks inherent in developing innovative products  such as nhl vaccines  make it difficult to forecast with certainty the capital required to commercialize our products 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements and expenses  we will have to raise additional funds 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders may be diluted 
we may raise this capital through public or private financings or additional collaborations  strategic partnerships or licensing arrangements 
we expect that the amount of additional capital we will require would be substantial 
our access to capital markets may be restricted by depressed stock valuations over an extended period of time 
we may be unsuccessful in entering into any new collaboration that results in significant revenues or cash flow 
if we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital or generate sufficient cash flows  we will have to curtail or cease operations 
our previous or future workforce reductions may hurt the performance of our continuing personnel  and make it more difficult to retain the services of key personnel 
we restructured our operations in  resulting in substantial workforce reductions 
these reductions were effected in all functional areas 
these personnel reductions or future reductions may create concerns about job security 
this may lower productivity or make it more likely that some of our key employees will seek new employment and require us to hire replacements 
these reductions also may make the management of our business more difficult and make it harder for us to attract employees in the future 
we are at an early stage of product commercialization  and we may not be able to successfully develop our products and technologies nor sustain commercial use of our technology we are in an early stage of commercialization  and we are subject to all the risks inherent in the development of a business enterprise  including the need for substantial capital to support the development of our products and technologies 
our anticipated products  including our novel vaccines for the treatment of nhl  most likely will require that we enter into new collaborations before we can manufacture and or market them 
vaccines are also subject to the governmental regulatory process 
because we are in new and developing fields  and our research focuses on new and unproven products  our therapeutic vaccines  proteins and other therapeutics under development may not be effective in humans  or may not meet regulatory requirements for safety and efficacy 
in addition  even if we successfully develop a product  there may not be a substantial commercial market for that product at commercially viable prices 
we are in new and developing fields and there may not be a market for our technologies our technologies  including our progex system and geneware technology  have limited commercial precedent 
much of our research is fundamentally unique and we cannot assure the acceptance of its scientific merit or the benefits of products produced by it  nor that the public will react favorably to it 
the usefulness of the information and products generated by our proteomics  functional genomics and bioinformatics technologies is unproven  and our collaborators and potential collaborators may determine that they are not useful or cost effective 
we generate large amounts of data from our research with genes and proteins and we 
table of contents may not be able to mine or integrate this data in a timely manner  or turn it into commercially viable information 
in addition  we must complete development of our technologies in time to meet market demand  if any 
if we fail to do so  it is likely that other technologies and companies will predominate and we will not be able to earn a sufficient return on our investment 
general economic conditions cause uncertainty with respect to other companies and entities collaborating with us or otherwise dealing with us  and this can have an adverse effect on our revenues and cash flows to a large extent  decisions by businesses and other entities to collaborate or otherwise do business with us are discretionary  and the decision making process typically takes many months to complete 
we believe that the prolonged slowdown in the us and global economies has caused  and may continue to cause potential collaborators and customers to defer decisions to work with us or to access our technologies 
as a result  we expect that revenues and cash flows will be uncertain for the next several quarters 
therefore  it is difficult to accurately assess and predict the future demand for our products  technologies and services 
if these general economic conditions continue  such conditions will likely have a continuing  adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
alternative technologies may supersede our technologies or make them non competitive genomics  proteomics  biomanufacturing and bioinformatics are intensely competitive fields 
they are characterized by extensive research efforts  which result in rapid technological progress that can render existing technologies obsolete or economically noncompetitive 
if our competitors succeed in developing products or technologies that are more effective than ours or that render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive  our business will suffer 
many universities  public agencies and established pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical and other life sciences companies with substantially greater resources than we have are developing and using technologies and are actively engaging in the development of products similar to or competitive with our products and technologies 
like us  our competitors are using proteomics and genomics technologies to identify potential drug targets  therapeutic proteins and diagnostic marker proteins 
in addition  our competitors have developed databases containing gene sequence  gene expression  genetic variation or other genomic information and are marketing or plan to market their data to pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical and other life sciences companies 
to remain competitive  we must continue to invest in new and existing technologies  expand our databases and improve our bioinformatics software 
we may not have the resources to continue such investment 
our competitors may devise faster  more complete or more accurate methods to obtain proteomic and functional genomic information than our technologies and systems  including our progex and geneware systems 
there has been and continues to be substantial academic and commercial research effort devoted to the development of such methods 
if a successful competitive method is developed  it would undermine the commercial basis for the products and technologies we intend to provide 
we may not be able to enter into collaborations necessary to fully develop and commercialize our products and technologies  and we will be dependent on our collaborators if we do we are independently pursuing some therapeutic product applications into the development stage 
however  we expect to develop and commercialize most of our future products in collaboration with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
for example  in we changed our strategy concerning our nhl vaccine and are seeking to proceed with a partner to 
table of contents complete the development of this product 
we cannot assure you that such collaborative arrangements will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if our cash flows continue to deteriorate or we take significant steps to reduce our expenses  potential partners may question our ability to perform and choose not to do business with us  which would make it harder for us to find a partner and would harm our ability to commercialize our products 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to enter into future collaborations with other companies for the financing of development and or regulatory approval and commercialization of our products 
our reliance upon these companies for these capabilities will reduce our control over such activities and could make us dependent upon them 
to date  we have entered into only a limited number of collaborations 
generally  the scope of these collaborations has been to demonstrate the function of plant genes and the feasibility of using viral vectors to create proteins in plants and to identify marker proteins for drug development and diagnostics 
our existing agreements provide us with rights to participate financially in the commercial development of products resulting from the use of our technologies 
we may be unable to obtain such rights in future collaborations 
in addition  unforeseen delays or complications could arise and result in the breach of our contractual obligations with our collaborators and others  or render our technologies unable to perform at the quality and capacity levels required for success 
conflicts with collaborators or licensees could harm our business conflicts with collaborators could have a negative impact on our relationships with them  including on our revenues to be derived from certain of these relationships  and impair our ability to enter into future collaborations  either of which could adversely affect our business 
collaborators could develop competing products  preclude us from entering into collaborations with their competitors or terminate their agreements with us prematurely 
moreover  disagreements could arise with collaborators or licensees over rights to our intellectual property  our rights to share in any of the future revenues from products or technologies resulting from use of our technologies  our rights to payments for achievement of milestones or our performance of research and development activities on behalf of collaborators  or our activities in separate fields may conflict with other business plans of our collaborators or licensees 
we must enter into agreements with third parties to provide sales and marketing services  or develop these capabilities on our own  if we are to successfully commercialize our products and technologies although we plan to enter into sales and marketing arrangements with third parties  we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on favorable terms  if at all 
if we cannot enter into these arrangements  we must develop a sales and marketing force with sufficient technical expertise to generate demand for our products and technologies 
our possible inability to develop or contract for effective sales and marketing capabilities would significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products 
we may not be able to successfully manufacture products in commercial quantities or at acceptable costs the failure of our technologies to provide safe  effective  useful or commercially viable approaches to the discovery and development of drug targets and proteins which can be used as therapeutics would significantly limit our business plan and future growth 

table of contents we may be unable to recruit and retain senior management and other key scientific personnel on whom we are dependent the loss of one or more of our senior management or other key scientific personnel could significantly harm our business and could inhibit our research and development and commercialization efforts 
none of our key personnel are subject to employment agreements 
we face competition for research scientists and technical staff from other companies  academic institutions  government entities  nonprofit laboratories and other organizations 
we have implemented cash salary reductions substituting non cash stock compensation for over twenty of our highest paid employees to conserve cash 
failure to recruit and retain senior management and scientific personnel on acceptable terms may prevent us from achieving our business objectives 
concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers  directors and principal stockholders may enable them to collectively influence significant corporate transactions that require stockholder approval our directors  our executive officers and principal stockholders affiliated with our directors and our executive officers beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  the concentration of ownership in combination with other common stockholders may collectively influence significant corporate transactions such as mergers  changes in control  consolidation or sale of some or all of our assets  and other significant corporate transactions requiring stockholder approval 
our stockholder rights plan and provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover  which could adversely affect our stock price we have adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of may  subject to certain specified exceptions and limitations under the rights plan  we will continue to issue one right for each share of common stock that becomes outstanding after may  each right entitles the holder to purchase one unit consisting of one one hundredth of a share of our series a junior participating preferred stock for per unit 
under certain circumstances  if a person or group acquires or more of our outstanding shares of common stock  holders of the rights other than the person or group causing their exercisability will be able to purchase  in exchange for the exercise price  shares of our common stock or of any company into which we are merged having a value of in addition  the board of directors has the option  under certain circumstances  to exchange each right other than rights held by the person or group triggering the board of directors option for a share of common stock for no additional consideration on the part of the holder of the right 
the rights expire on april  our rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock by causing substantial dilution of the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to acquire control of us 
our rights plan may have the effect of discouraging takeover attempts because a potential acquirer would have to negotiate with our board of directors to avoid suffering dilution 
provisions in our charter and bylaws and applicable provisions of the delaware general corporation law may also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors 
these provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our common stock or delay  prevent or deter a merger  acquisition  tender offer or proxy contest  which may adversely affect our stock price 

table of contents risks related to our industry if companies in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  agricultural  chemical and life sciences industries do not succeed or their demand for our products and technologies decreases  then our revenues could be reduced we expect to derive our revenues primarily from products and technologies provided to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  agricultural  chemical and life sciences industries 
accordingly  our success will depend directly on the success of companies in these industries and their demand for our products  services and technologies 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by companies in those industries  or their unwillingness or inability to use our products and technologies 
these reductions and delays may result from factors that are not within our control  such as changes in economic conditions generally  the extent to which companies in these industries conduct research and development involving proteomics and functional genomics in house or through industry consortia  the extent to which genomic information is or is not made publicly available  consolidation within one or more of these industries  changes in the regulatory environment affecting these industries  pricing pressures  market driven pressures on companies to consolidate and reduce costs  and or other factors affecting research and development spending in these industries 
if competitive products are better than our products  then our business may fail the markets for protein development and production  including human and veterinary therapeutics and vaccines such as the ones we are developing  are highly competitive 
we face significant competition in our protein product development and production efforts from entities using alternative  and in some cases higher volume and larger scale  approaches for the same purpose 
competitors with substantially greater resources are actively developing products similar to or competitive with our products and potential products 
our competitors may succeed in developing products or obtaining regulatory approval before we do or in developing products that are more effective than those we develop or propose to develop 
a large number of universities and other not for profit institutions  many of which are funded by the us and foreign governments  are also conducting research to discover genes and their functions 
any one or more of these entities may discover and establish a patent position in one or more of the genes or proteins that we wish to commercialize 
in addition  several pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical and other life sciences companies engage in research and development in the use of unique gene expression systems to produce therapeutic proteins 
these competitors may develop products earlier or obtain regulatory approvals faster than we may be able to  or develop products that are more effective than ours 
new developments are expected to continue  and discoveries by others may render our products and technologies noncompetitive  which could lead to the failure of our business 

table of contents we and our collaborators may not obtain fda and other approvals for our products in a timely manner  or at all drugs and diagnostic products are subject to an extensive and uncertain regulatory approval process by the fda and comparable agencies in other countries 
the regulation of new products is extensive  and the required process of laboratory testing and human studies is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the burden of these regulations will fall on us to the extent we are developing proprietary products 
we may not be able to obtain the clearances and approvals necessary for the clinical testing  field testing  manufacturing or marketing of our products 
if the products are the result of a collaborative effort  these burdens may fall on our collaborators or we may share these burdens with them 
we may not obtain fda or other approvals for those products in a timely manner  or at all 
we may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in our efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses 
even if we obtain fda regulatory approvals  the fda extensively regulates manufacturing  labeling  marketing  promotion and advertising after product approval 
further  once a manufacturer obtains regulatory approval  a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review  and discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product  manufacturer or manufacturing facility  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
in some countries  regulatory agencies also set or approve the sale prices for drug products 
additionally  several of our product development areas may involve relatively new technology that has not been the subject of extensive product testing in humans 
the regulatory requirements governing these products and related clinical procedures remain uncertain and the products themselves may be subject to substantial review by the fda and foreign governmental regulatory authorities that could prevent or delay approval 
regulatory requirements ultimately imposed on our products could limit our ability to test  manufacture and commercialize our products 
if new rules issued by the usda adversely affect us or our collaborators ability to commercialize genetically modified products  then our ability to sell certain products and technologies will be severely impaired we must comply with usda regulations for outdoor releases of genetically engineered organisms as well as other products designed for use on or with agricultural products 
the usda has released regulations that prohibit the inclusion of genetically modified ingredients in products labeled as organic 
the usda regulations also prohibit the use of genetically modified fibers in clothing labeled as organic 
these regulations ultimately could make any products that may be developed with our collaborators  including dow  unattractive to or too expensive for consumers  or could cause the government to prohibit their sale or use 
in addition  the usda prohibits growing and transporting genetically modified plants except pursuant to an exemption or under special permits 
we may use genetically modified plants as screening or production hosts 
changes in usda policy regarding the movement or field release of genetically modified plant hosts could adversely affect our business by increasing the cost of our products and technologies or decreasing consumer demand for those products and technologies or causing the government to prohibit their sale or use 
if there is negative public reaction to the use of genetically engineered products and technologies  then the market for certain products and technologies we develop will be adversely affected future commercial success of some of our products and of the products of some of our collaborators  will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of genetically engineered products including drugs  plants and plant products 
claims that genetically engineered products 
table of contents are unsafe for consumption or pose a danger to the environment may influence public attitudes 
negative public reaction to genetically modified organisms and products could result in greater government regulation of genetic research and resultant products  including stricter labeling requirements  and could cause a decrease in the demand for our products  even if such products do not result from gmo organisms 
we may be sued for product liability and our product liability insurance may not be adequate the testing  marketing and sale of our and our collaborators products will entail a risk of allegations of product liability  and third parties may assert substantial product liability claims against us 
while we have limited product liability insurance to protect against this risk  adequate insurance coverage may not be available at an acceptable cost  if at all  in the future and a product liability claim or product recall could materially and adversely affect our business 
inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of the products we or our collaborators develop 
if we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our products or our collaborators products  our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability 
if we use hazardous materials in our business in a manner that causes injury or violates laws  we may be liable for substantial damages our research and development processes involve the use of hazardous materials  including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials 
our operations also produce hazardous waste products 
the chemicals we use include  but are not limited to  flammable solvents such as methanol and ethanol  ethidium dye which is a commonly used fluorescent dye for visualizing dna  and buffer solutions used in the purification of dna  and various organic solvents  acids and bases 
we also use several radioisotopes including phosphorous  carbon  sulfur  phosphorous  iodine and hydrogen we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
we could be subject to civil damages and criminal penalties in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of  or exposure of individuals to  hazardous materials 
further  it is possible that the materials we use could contaminate another party s property 
in addition  claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials  and our liability may exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability 
in addition  compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research and development and production efforts 
although we have general liability insurance  these policies do not cover claims arising from pollution from chemical  radioactive or biological materials 
our collaborators may also be working with various types of hazardous materials in connection with our collaborations 
in the event of a lawsuit or investigation  we could be held responsible for any injury we or our collaborators cause to persons or property by exposure to  or release of  any hazardous materials 
healthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursements may limit the financial returns from our products our ability and that of our collaborators to commercialize therapeutics and diagnostic products may depend in part on the extent to which government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations will pay the cost of these products 
these third parties are increasingly challenging both the need for and the price of new medical 
table of contents products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics and diagnostics  and adequate third party reimbursement may not be available for any product to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development 
risks related to our intellectual property patent protection in the biotechnology industry is uncertain  which may result in a decrease in the value of our products and technologies we are involved in overlapping and rapidly evolving areas of biotechnology  pharmaceutical development and basic research involving viral vectors  plant transgenics  proteomics  functional genomics  protein transformation  and immunotherapy 
each of these areas has been the subject of intense research and patenting activity throughout the world by our commercial competitors  actual and potential collaborators  academic institutions and government researchers 
we cannot determine whether or not there are patents currently pending that  if issued  would prevent us from practicing our core technologies  commercializing them or developing commercially viable products based upon them 
the patent positions of biotechnology firms generally are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions that will determine who has the right to develop a particular product 
changes in  or different interpretations of  patent laws in the united states and other countries might allow others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize products and technologies similar to our products and technologies without any compensation to us 
our potential collaborators or customers may conclude that uncertainties about patent protection decrease the value of our databases  products and services 
throughout the world there are numerous issued patents  as well as published foreign patent applications which may issue as patents  many of which relate to our current operations  our anticipated future operations and the products we are likely to develop 
the scope of these patents is a matter of legal interpretation and is subject to uncertainty 
we have not obtained  but we may in the future obtain  opinions from our patent counsel that we have freedom to conduct our commercial activities free of claims of patent infringement from third parties 
for example  we are aware of one company  enzon  inc  that through its subsidiary  sca ventures  inc  owns or has licensed a broad portfolio of patents to single chain antigen binding proteins 
enzon  in a letter mailed to numerous companies including us  has stated that it would like to discuss providing a license under these patents 
in addition  dow owns or controls certain patent rights in the field of viral vectors covering the infection of plant cells and the expression of foreign genes in plant cells  and has informed us that it believes that some of our plant viral activities may fall within the scope of its patents 
two patents issued to us in october reference the dow controlled patents and conclude that they do not constitute prior art 
if we are unable to resolve this matter  and are found to have infringed upon dow s rights  our product development and research activities related to plant viruses which fall within the scope of dow s patents may be delayed or terminated 
these kinds of disagreements could result in costly and time consuming litigation and divert our financial and managerial resources 
epicyte pharmaceuticals  inc  in a letter mailed to several companies  invited us to participate in a licensing program under their patent for marking immunoglobulins in plants 
maxygen  inc sent us a cautionary letter regarding our grammr molecular evolution technology 
maxygen owns several patents to its own proprietary methods 
we are not aware of any overlap between our activities and the maxygen patents 
if it turns out that we require a license from either of these companies  it would increase the cost of doing business in these areas 
if a dispute should arise between lsbc and either of these companies  it could result in delay or termination of these activities 

table of contents our patent applications may not result in issued patents that are enforceable our disclosures in our patent applications may not be sufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability in all cases 
as a result  we do not know which of our patent applications will result in enforceable patents 
our patent applications may not issue as patents  and any patents that are issued to us may not provide commercially meaningful protection against competitors 
any issued patent may not provide us with competitive advantages 
others may challenge our patents or independently develop similar products which could result in an interference proceeding in the us patent and trademark office 
others may be able to design around our issued patents or develop products similar to our products 
in addition  others may discover uses for genes or proteins other than those uses covered in our patents  and these other uses may be separately patentable 
public disclosure and patents relating to genes and gene sequences held by others may limit our proprietary rights the human genome project and many companies and institutions have identified genes and deposited those sequences in public databases and are continuing to do so 
these public disclosures might limit the scope of our claims or make unpatentable subsequent patent applications on full length gene sequences 
we are aware of issued patents and patent applications containing subject matter such that we or our licensees or collaborators may require a license or rights in order to research  develop or commercialize some of our products and technologies 
we may find that licenses relating to such subject matter will not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
patent infringement or enforcement litigation or interference proceedings could be costly and disrupt our business and may prevent us from commercializing our products the technology that we use to develop our products and key resources  and those that we incorporate in our products and technologies  may be subject to claims by third parties  including our collaborators  that they infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
technologies of our collaborators may also be subject to infringement or similar claims which could impair our collaborative product development and commercialization efforts 
we also may need to enforce our patent rights in actions against others  which could be expensive 
the risk of such events occurring will tend to increase as the fields of proteomics  genomics and the biotechnology industry expand  more patents are issued and other companies attempt to discover genes and proteins and engage in other proteomics  genomics and biotechnology related businesses 
with respect to identifying proteins uniquely associated with disease states or as targets for drug therapy  we are aware that companies have published patent applications relating to nucleic acids encoding specific proteins 
if the us patent and trademark office issues patents to these companies  their patents may limit our ability and the ability of our collaborators to practice under any patents that may be issued to us 
also  even if the us patent and trademark office issues us a patent  the scope of coverage or protection afforded to the patent may be limited 
we may not be able to protect our know how and trade secrets we generally control the disclosure and use of our know how and trade secrets using confidentiality agreements 
it is possible  however  that some or all confidentiality agreements will not be honored  third parties will independently develop equivalent technology  
table of contents disputes might arise with our consultants  collaborators or others concerning the ownership of intellectual property  and or unauthorized disclosure of our know how or trade secrets will occur item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company s investments consist of money market funds  commercial paper  corporate and us government agency notes  and bank certificates of deposit 
the company does not invest in derivative instruments 
the company mitigates its risk of principle loss by investing only in securities of high quality issuers with maturities of less than one year and limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the table below presents the amortized principal amount  weighted average interest rates and maturities for the company s investment portfolio at december  the amortized principal amount approximates fair value at december  if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of the company s investments would change by an immaterial amount
