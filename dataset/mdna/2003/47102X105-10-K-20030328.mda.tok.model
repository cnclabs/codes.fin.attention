accordingly  a non cash charge of million was recorded to accrue additional deferred income taxes  resulting in taxes being provided on janus share of dst earnings since at full statutory rates 
previous to this change  the company had provided deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of dst net of the dividends received deduction provided for under current tax law

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates janus consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
janus continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare its consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
janus management believes its critical accounting policies and estimates include accounting for intangible assets and goodwill  value determination for compensatory fixed accounting stock plans  and accounting for income taxes 
accounting for intangible assets and goodwill 
intangibles assets and goodwill comprise billion  or  of our total assets at december  the majority of this balance was recorded in with the additional investment in jcm of approximately  million 
two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in connection with these investments  a valuation was completed by a third party to determine a reasonable purchase price allocation 
upon completion of the allocation process  approximately of the purchase price was assigned to various identified intangible assets and the remainder was allocated to goodwill 
in addition to marketplace information  the third party valuation considered management s estimates and judgments as to growth rates and operating margins over a range of assumptions for the various products  distribution channels and business strategies 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested at least annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit associated with the goodwill to the reporting unit s recorded value 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment using a one step process that compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset 
to complete the annual test for potential impairment of intangible assets and goodwill  janus considers performance compared to peers  significant changes in the underlying business and products of the reporting units  material and ongoing negative industry or economic trends  or other factors specific to each asset or reporting unit being evaluated 
due to the significance of the identified intangible assets and goodwill to janus consolidated balance sheet  the annual impairment analysis is critical 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
janus tested indefinite life intangibles and goodwill for potential impairment as of january   adoption date of sfas no 
and and there was no impairment 
in the third quarter of  prior to the annual testing date  janus recorded a million goodwill impairment  associated with its investment in a subsidiary operating in the united kingdom 
in accordance with the annual testing requirement of sfas no 
 janus again tested indefinite life intangibles and goodwill for potential impairment as of october   and no impairment charge was required 
value determination for compensatory fixed accounting stock plans 
since  jcm has granted restricted shares to certain jcm employees pursuant to restricted grants 
the shares vest on a pro rata basis over a five year period  although certain grants are subject to accelerated vesting of in one 
table of contents year if specific goals are attained 
the fair value of the shares granted was determined by an independent nationally recognized investment banking firm 
valuation of non traded equity securities requires estimates and judgments  including consideration of management s estimates and judgments as to growth rates and operating margins over a range of assumptions for the various products  distribution channels and business strategies 
expense is recognized by janus over the vesting period and totaled  and million in  and  respectively 
in the event that the fair value estimated upon date of grant for each of the restricted stock awards was incorrect  the amount of amortization being recorded each year would be incorrect  therefore affecting the reported net income each year 
management expects that janus common stock will be used for substantially all future equity grants 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing janus provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets  and the evaluation of various income tax contingencies 
janus has not recorded a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets as of december   based on management s belief that operating income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if janus historical trend of positive operating income changes  janus may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on janus consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
janus trends and outlook janus earnings and cash flows are heavily dependent on prevailing financial market conditions 
significant increases or decreases in the various securities markets  particularly the equity markets  can have a material impact on janus results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
additionally  janus results are impacted by the relative performance of janus products and their risk characteristics  introduction and market reception of new products and the closing of existing funds to new investors  as well as other factors  including increases in the rate of return of alternative investment products  increasing competition as the number of mutual funds and alternative investments continues to grow  changes in marketing and distribution channels  and inability to retain portfolio management professionals 
although management does not expect the high average growth rates of the late s to be repeated in the foreseeable future  management also does not expect the declines over the last three years to be indicative of future years 
due primarily to the downturn in the financial equity markets  janus assets under management significantly declined from levels experienced during average assets under management for were billion compared to billion for average assets under management can fluctuate based on fund flows and changes in the market value of funds and accounts managed by jcm  intech  bay isle or berger 
accordingly  revenues during could decrease from the comparable periods to the extent that the markets continue to be unfavorable to equity growth investors and result in declines in average assets under management 
a decrease in revenues could result in lower operating income and net income 
management expects that janus may experience margin pressures in the future should assets continue to decline and janus is unable to reduce its expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following information  together with information included in other parts of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risk to janus 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity as of december   all of janus long term debt was at fixed interest rates 
however  in february  janus entered into a receive fixed  pay float interest rate exchange agreement with a high rated financial institution with respect to janus million senior notes 
the effect of this agreement was to increase janus exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
in october  janus terminated the hedge contract and received million from the third party for the fair value of the interest rate exchange agreement 
foreign exchange sensitivity janus has subsidiaries in the united kingdom and hong kong 
with respect to these investments  matters arise as to financial accounting and reporting for foreign currency transactions and for translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars 
the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is not material as the majority of the revenue earned by our international subsidiaries is denominated in us dollars 
available for sale investment sensitivity janus invests a portion of the revenues earned from providing investment advisory services in certain non money market sponsored funds 
accordingly  these investments are carried in janus consolidated financial statements at fair market value and are subject to the investment performance of the underlying sponsored fund 
any unrealized gain or loss is recognized upon the sale of the investment 
additionally  dst  a owned equity investment  holds available for sale investments that may affect janus consolidated financial statements 
similar to the janus securities  any changes to the market value of the dst s available for sale investments are reflected  net of deferred income tax  in dst s accumulated other comprehensive income component of its equity 
accordingly  janus records its proportionate share of this amount as part of the investment in dst 
while these changes in market value do not result in any impact to janus consolidated results of operations currently  upon disposition by dst of these investments  janus will record its proportionate share of the gain or loss as a component of equity earnings 
equity price sensitivity janus owns of dst  a publicly traded company 
while changes in the market price of dst are not reflected in janus consolidated results of operation or financial position  they may affect the perceived value of the janus common stock
