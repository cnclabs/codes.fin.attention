item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains forward looking statements for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of  and it is the company s intention that such statements be protected by the safe harbor created thereby 
examples of such forward looking statements include statements regarding future revenues  expenses  losses and cash flows  our ability to be cash flow positive in the fourth quarter of  research and development activities and sales and marketing initiatives such as our plan to concentrate our efforts in those areas such as building our core consumables business  possible future acquisitions  the anticipated effects of the acquisition of jones group to our net sales performance and pre tax operating results  our plans to discontinue non performing consumable products and certain legacy instrument products  the anticipated effects of our recent restructuring program and related accruals  values of our assets and liabilities over their remaining useful lives and our testing for impairment of goodwill  and our expectations as to the duration of our negative cash flows from operations and the sufficiency of existing cash reserves for the next months 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements due to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including the risk that a decline in the economy generally or the market for our products will adversely affect our business  the risk that the market for our products and services does not develop as anticipated  the risk that we are unable to successfully integrate the product and 
table of contents service offerings of the company we recently acquired and successfully capitalize on anticipated synergies and growth opportunities  and the risk that our restructuring programs do not proceed as planned and that we incur unexpected expenses in connection with the implementation thereof 
for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties related to our business see the discussion set forth herein under additional factors that may affect future results 
overview argonaut develops innovative products designed to help pharmaceutical and other chemists engaged in the discovery and development of new chemical entities increase their productivity and reduce their operating costs without compromising the scientific integrity of their research 
our products are designed to enable chemists to increase their productivity  reduce their operating costs through automation and process simplification  and cost effectively explore the increasing number of drug targets available for drug development 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of our chemistry consumable products  instrumentation products and services 
we commenced commercial shipment of our first generation instrument in  the quest product line in  the trident product line in and the surveyor and the endeavor product lines in revenue from sales of our instrument products is recognized when delivery and installation of the product is complete 
we also derive revenues from the sale of reagents and other instrument related consumables  as well as revenues derived from products and integration services and the sale of instruments and consumables products of jones chromatography limited jones group  which we acquired on february  our expenses have consisted primarily of costs incurred in research and development  manufacturing and general and administrative costs associated with our operations  and our sales and marketing organization 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we believe we will be cash flow positive in the fourth quarter of if we can achieve the many elements of our business plan and overcome the many risks detailed in item recent developments acquisition of jones group on february   argonaut completed its acquisition of jones chromatography limited  a company organized under the laws of england and wales jcl  and its wholly owned subsidiaries international sorbent technology ist and jones chromatography usa  inc jci collectively  jones group 
pursuant to a share purchase agreement the purchase agreement  dated february   among argonaut and the stockholders of jcl  the jones group became a wholly owned subsidiary of argonaut 
the jones group continues to operate out of its cardiff  wales  uk locations 
the jones group is a leading manufacturer and distributor of high quality chromatography and purification accessories  consumables and instrumentation 
consumable items include leading brand sorbents  solid phase extraction spe columns and well plates  flash chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography hplc columns 
it manufactures purification and other chemistry development instruments for the drug discovery market 
in the transaction  the stockholders of jcl exchanged all of their respective shares of jcl s stock for i cash in an aggregate amount of   ii  shares of unregistered argonaut common stock  and iii notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of  
including transactions costs of approximately million  the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  valued as of the closing of the transaction 
the notes payable  which are redeemable for cash over a two year period following the closing date  are guaranteed by barclays bank plc 
under the terms of the share purchase agreement  notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of  million will be held in escrow until february   the second anniversary of the closing date  and may be used to satisfy certain indemnification obligations  if any  of the principal jcl shareholders 
in addition  certain employees of the jones group remaining as employees after the transaction have received stock options to purchase an aggregate  shares of argonaut s common stock at an exercise price of per share 

table of contents immediately prior to the acquisition of the jones group by the company  the shareholders of jcl effected a series of transactions whereby jcl acquired all of the shares in the capital of ist and jci which were not previously held by jcl 
restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of  the company announced a restructuring program to downsize our organizational structure in order to reduce operating expenses and improve workforce processes and efficiencies 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of  which includes termination benefits and related expenses of  related to a reduction of our workforce by employees and expenses of  for abandonment of excess equipment 
the restructuring program was expected to yield cash savings of approximately million annually  beginning in fiscal these savings largely relate to reduced employee related costs and were expected to be realized primarily in operating expenses 
at december   all employees had been terminated and the accrued restructuring liability was zero 
for the twelve month period ended december   cash payments related to the restructuring program were  on august   the company announced its intention to execute a restructuring program focused on improving productivity  reducing operational expenses in remote offices  and implementing a workforce reduction of approximately of the existing worldwide employees 
as a result  the company recognized a charge of million in the third quarter ending september  the charge included termination benefits and related expenses of approximately  related to the reduction of our workforce by employees  expenses of approximately  related to the abandonment of excess equipment  expenses of approximately  for the abandonment of excess leased facilities  and expenses of approximately  for various related charges 
the restructuring program is estimated to result in annualized savings of approximately million beginning in fiscal  realized primarily in reduced operating costs as a result of reduced employee related costs 
at december   of the employees had been terminated and the accrued restructuring liability was  during  cash payments related to the restructuring program were  remaining cash expenditures relating to workforce reduction and other related charges will be paid through the first quarter of fiscal amounts related to the abandonment of excess leased facilities will be paid as the lease payments are due through the remainder of the lease terms through critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of investments  inventory adjustments  warranty liabilities  restructuring charge  purchase accounting  impairment of long lived assets  income tax and stock compensation to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition for each arrangement  we determine whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  collectibility is reasonably assured and fees are fixed or determinable 
if any of these criteria are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until all of the criteria are met 
product revenue revenue related to product sales with no future obligation is recognized upon shipment when the recognition criteria have been met 
for those products where we have obligations to provide installation 
table of contents services  revenue is recognized upon installation when the recognition criteria have been met 
sales that require customer acceptance are not recognized as revenue until the requirements have been met 
services revenue maintenance contract revenue  including revenue for extended warranties  is recognized ratably over the contractual period  training  contract research and development  and other services revenue is recognized as the services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the composition of our accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering our customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
investments investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders equity 
investment income is recorded when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary 
if investments are determined to be impaired  a capital loss is recognized at the date of determination 
testing for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgment 
the identification of potentially impaired investments  the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements 
the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments 
revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known  and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time 
the current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 
the same influences tend to increase the risk of potentially impaired assets 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out cost method or market value 
we record adjustments to the value of inventory based upon the forecasted plans to sell our inventories 
the physical condition eg  age and quality of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 

table of contents restructuring during fiscal years and  we recorded significant reserves in connection with our restructuring program 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs  related abandonment of excess equipment  the abandonment of excess leased facilities  and other related charges 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
purchase accounting in june  the financing accounting standards board issued sfas  business combinations sfas 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  sfas also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  we accounted for the acquisitions of atsi and jones group under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the acquired assets and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective fair values 
the recorded values of assets and liabilities were based on third party estimates and valuations 
the remaining values were based on our judgments and estimates  and accordingly  the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations may be affected by changes in estimates and judgments 
amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles in june  the financing accounting standards board issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
sfas requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
additionally  sfas requires that goodwill included in the carrying value of equity method investments no longer be amortized 
the company adopted sfas on january  the company reclassified  of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives  as defined by sfas  to goodwill at the date of adoption 
the company tested for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment using a two step process prescribed by sfas the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of impairment by reporting unit  if any 
the company performed the first step of the required impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the second quarter of fiscal  determining that no impairment was indicated 
the company performed the annual test for impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives as prescribed by sfas during the fourth quarter of fiscal  determining that no impairment was indicated 
the company determined the fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives based on a present value analysis of the discounted future cash flows 
income tax we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
stock compensation deferred stock compensation is the difference between the exercise price of the options and the fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
the fair value was determined based on the business factors underlying the value of our common stock on the date of grant viewed in light of our initial public offering in july and the anticipated initial public offering price per share 
the deferred stock compensation was recorded as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized over the vesting periods of the options  
table of contents generally four years  using the graded vesting method 
we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million in the year ended december  in connection with the grant of stock options to employees 
we have recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of approximately  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had a total of approximately  to be amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options 
we also recorded stock compensation of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  in connection with options granted to consultants 
these options are periodically re measured as they vest  in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
comparative results of operations years ended december  and operating results for the year ended december  include jones group since february  net sales net sales in were million compared to million in  a growth of 
for  instrument sales comprised approximately of net sales  chemistry consumables sales comprised approximately of net sales  and service  integration services and contract research and development r d together comprised approximately of net sales 
instrument sales were million in versus million in  a growth of approximately 
chemistry consumables sales were million in versus million in  a growth of 
the substantial growth in chemistry consumables products is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the jones group 
cost of sales cost of sales  comprised of cost of products and cost of services was million in versus million in the increase in cost of sales is primarily due to the higher sales volume and a special charge related to the write off of excess and obsolete inventory of approximately  recorded based on the company s decision to discontinue active selling of certain products as a component of a broader restructuring plan 
gross margin as a percent of sales was for compared to in excluding the charges related to the write off of excess and obsolete inventory recorded in the third quarter  and the dilutive effect of contract research and development  gross margin as a percent of sales would have been in compared to for year over year improvement in gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to the combined effects of reduced manufacturing spending due to restructuring and shifts in product mix resulting from the acquisition of the jones group 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased to million in compared to million in  a decrease of 
these expenses include salaries and related costs of research and development personnel  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  the costs of facilities and related expenses  non recurring engineering charges and prototype costs related to the design  development testing  pre manufacturing and significant improvement of our products 
the decrease was primarily attributable to lower personnel costs resulting from the effects of the restructuring programs initiated in the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of  and reduced stock based compensation expenses  offset by approximately  due to the addition of the jones group 
stock based compensation expenses related to research and development decreased by  for as compared to for the year ended december   stock based compensation expense was  versus  for the same period in 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for executive  sales and marketing  finance and other administrative personnel  the cost of facilities and related spending  and the costs associated with promotional and other marketing expenses 
the increase was primarily attributable to approximately million of additional expenses for the jones group  acquired on february   and therefore  not reflected in the prior year  offset by the effect of the restructuring efforts initiated in the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of  and reduced stock based compensation charges 
stock based compensation expenses related to selling  general and administration decreased by  for  as compared to for the year ended december   stock based compensation expense was  versus million in amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquired in process research development on january   the company adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually  more frequently if certain indicators are present 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
as of december   the company had million in goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life  and thus  no amortization expense was recorded for these assets during the year ended december  amortization of goodwill arising from acquisitions accounted for  in the year ended december  for the year ended december   the company recorded amortization of purchased intangibles of  related to the march  acquisition of atsi and the february  acquisition of jones group compared to million in the same period of the company recorded in process research and development expense of  for the year ended december   relating to atsi  and no such charges were incurred in restructuring charge on august   the company announced its intention to execute a restructuring program focused on improving productivity  reducing operational expenses in remote offices  and implementing a workforce reduction of approximately of its existing worldwide employees 
as a result  the company recognized a charge of million in the third quarter ended september  the charge includes termination benefits and related expenses of approximately  related to the reduction of the workforce by employees  expenses of approximately  related to the abandonment of excess equipment  expenses of approximately  for the abandonment of excess leased facilities  and expenses of approximately  for various other related charges 
at december   of the employees had been terminated and the accrued restructuring charge was  for the year ended december   cash payments related to the restructuring program were  interest and other income expense  net interest and other income decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in  primarily because of lower average balances of invested cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and reduced interest rates consistent with the overall interest rate decline of high quality short term investments 
interest and other expenses was  for the year ended december  compared to  in the same period in primarily due to the interest associated with the notes payable for the jones group acquisition 
provision for income taxes as of december   we had federal net operating loss and research credit carryforwards of approximately million and  respectively  which expire on various dates between and utilization of our net operating loss may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership 
table of contents change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization 
the company recorded a provision for foreign income taxes of approximately  to record primarily the uk corporate tax liability of jones group for the year ended december  years ended december  and net sales net sales in were million compared to million in the decrease was substantially attributable to reduced unit volume sales of instrument products as a result of the general economic slowdown and more careful scrutiny of capital expenditures by our customers 
a substantially offsetting factor was the additional net sales of approximately million that was generated from products and services in connection with our acquisition of atsi on march  cost of sales cost of sales increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to retrofit costs associated with the more recently introduced surveyor and endeavor products and the additional costs typically associated with early production units 
in addition  gross margin performance attributable to products and services in connection with atsi are historically lower overall 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses increased to million in from million in approximately million of this increase is attributable to additional r d personnel  facility expenses and other related spending in connection with atsi 
we incurred additional spending for outside professional services related to process improvement initiatives targeted at redesigning our product development processes 
as a partial offset to these expenses  stock based compensation expense was approximately  less in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in primary factors contributing to this increase were additional expenses attributable to the addition of atsi related headcount and related expenses aggregating approximately million  the first full year of additional expenses operating as a public company  and facility related relocation expenses as referred to above 
as a partial offset to these increased expenses  stock based compensation expense was approximately million less in compared to impairment charge  amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets was million for fiscal representing the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisition of atsi on march  goodwill and other purchased intangible assets were preliminarily amortized based on estimated useful lives of years 
at december   the purchase price allocation was finalized  resulting in modifications to the estimated useful lives of the individual intangible assets 
until the adoption of fas at january   goodwill was amortized over years 
other purchased intangible assets are amortized over to years 
in  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  we reviewed long lived assets  including goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable  such as a significant industry downturn  significant decline in the market value of the company  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
under sfas  an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected 
table of contents to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is assessed using discounted cash flows 
downturns in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and chemical industries had negatively impacted the forecasted revenues and expected cash flows from atsi 
the comparison of the undiscounted expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the related purchased intangible assets resulted in an impairment of the assets acquired  and a write down of these assets of approximately million during our fourth quarter of fiscal  in accordance with our policy 
acquired in process research and development expense during fiscal  we recorded  of acquired in process research and development ipr d resulting from the acquisition of atsi 
this amount was expensed on the acquisition date because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
there can be no assurance that acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies by us in the future will not result in substantial charges for ipr d that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results 
developed technology and ipr d were identified and valued through extensive interviews  analysis of data provided by atsi concerning developmental products  their stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete them  if applicable  their expected income generating ability  target markets and associated risks 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the developed technology and ipr d 
where developmental projects had reached technological feasibility  they were classified as developed technology  and the value assigned to developed technology was capitalized 
where the developmental projects had not reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses  they were classified as ipr d and charged to expense upon closing of the acquisition 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased ipr d into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet their design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
in valuing the ipr d  we considered  among other factors  the importance of each project to the overall development plan  projected incremental cash flows from the projects when completed and any associated risks 
the projected incremental cash flows were discounted back to their present value using a discount rate of 
the discount rate was determined after consideration of our weighted average cost of capital and the weighted average return on assets 
associated risks include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced a restructuring program to downsize our organizational structure in order to reduce operating expenses and improve workforce processes and efficiencies 
as a result  we recorded a charge of  which included termination benefits and related expenses of  related to a reduction of our workforce by employees and expenses of  for abandonment of excess equipment 
remaining cash expenditures relating to workforce reduction were paid in the first two quarters of fiscal the restructuring program was expected to yield cash savings of approximately million annually  beginning in fiscal these savings largely relate to reduced employee related costs and were expected to be realized primarily in operating expenses 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income of million in compared to million in this increase reflects the net effect of higher average balances of invested cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments in 
table of contents as a result of the completion of our initial public offering in july  substantially offset by reduced interest rate yields consistent with the overall interest rate decline of high quality short term financial instruments 
interest and other expense was  in compared to  in as a result of the continuing reduction of the company s debt obligations 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash of million compared to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to the use of million in connection with the purchase of the jones group and related expenses  approximately  in cash payments related to the restructuring initiated in the fourth quarter of  approximately  in cash payments related to the restructuring activities initiated in the third quarter of  and approximately million used in other general operating activities 
the restricted cash amount is denominated in british pounds sterling and represents the cash used to secure the notes payable of  million as purchase consideration in the acquisition of jones group 
the notes are payable over two years carrying an initial interest rate of per annum for the twelve month period commencing on the date of note issuance  payable quarterly 
net cash used to support operating activities has historically fluctuated based on the timing of payments of accounts payable balances  receipts of customer deposits  receipt of payments of accounts receivable balances  changes in inventory balances resulting from varying levels of manufacturing activities  the timing of research and development projects  the timing and scope of our sales and marketing initiatives and fluctuations in the company s net loss 
the acquisition of jones group was completed on february  for purchase consideration of approximately  shares of unregistered argonaut common stock   million cash due at closing  and notes payable aggregating  million payable over two years  plus acquisition related legal  accounting  and other transaction expenses of approximately  net cash provided by investing activities totaled million in versus net cash used in investing activities of million in the change in was primarily attributable to the use of million in connection with the purchase of the jones group  the use of million as collateral for the notes payable portion of the jones group acquisition  offset by the proceeds generated from the sale and maturity of short term investments which provide cash to fund the company s ongoing operating activities 
on august   the company announced the approval by its board of directors of a stock repurchase program pursuant to which shares of its outstanding common stock having an aggregate value of up to  may be repurchased through open market transactions at prices deemed appropriate by the company 
the duration of the stock repurchase program is open ended 
the timing and amount of repurchase transactions under this program will depend on market conditions  corporate and regulatory considerations  and will be funded from available working capital 
at december   the company had repurchased  shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of per share 
the company expects to have negative cash flows from operations through at least the first half of we may also use cash resources to fund additional collaborative or strategic relationships  acquisitions or investments in other businesses  technologies or product lines 
our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the need to acquire licenses to new technology and the availability of other financing on acceptable terms 
we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next months 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our operations 
there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate  our operations or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative or strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies or products that we might otherwise seek to retain 

table of contents the following summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than to to contractual obligations total year years years notes payable jones group capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations factors that may affect our future results we have a history of operating losses and we may never achieve or sustain profitability and may be required to raise additional funds if losses continue 
we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and we recorded net losses of million for the twelve month period ended december  although we expect to become cash flow positive in the fourth quarter of  we expect to continue to incur operating and net losses during and we may never generate positive cash flows 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our products 
funds may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity  the issuance of those securities will result in dilution to our stockholders 
if our products do not become widely used in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and chemical industries  it is unlikely that we will ever become profitable 
pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and chemical organizations have historically performed chemistry development using traditional laboratory methods 
to date  our products have not been widely adopted by these industries 
the commercial success of our products will depend upon the adoption of these products as a method to develop chemical compounds for these industries 
in order to be successful  our products must meet the performance and pricing requirements for chemistry development within the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and chemical industries 
market acceptance will depend on many factors  including our ability to convince prospective customers that our products are a cost effective alternative to traditional methods and other technologies that may be introduced for chemistry development 
convince prospective customers that our products provide the same or enhanced quality and accuracy as compared with traditional methods and other new technologies that may be developed 
manufacture products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and at an acceptable cost 
install and service sufficient numbers of our instruments  particularly new instruments such as the advantage series tm process chemistry workstation 
if we cannot achieve these objectives  our products will not gain market acceptance 
we face risks associated with past and future acquisitions 
our success depends in part on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands and competitive pressures 
to meet these challenges  we have acquired complementary businesses and may choose to acquire others in the future 
we completed our acquisition of atsi in march and jones group in february during  we made significant 
table of contents progress integrating the jones group business  however  we continue to have remaining integration activities and projects 
our failure to completely and successfully integrate this business may materially affect our business going forward 
we do not know if we will be able to complete any future acquisitions  or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  operate it profitably or retain its key employees 
integrating any business  product or technology we acquire could be expensive and time consuming  and may disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management 
if we are unable to effectively integrate any acquired entities  products or technologies  our business may suffer 
in addition  any amortization of goodwill or other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could negatively impact our operating results 
our available cash and securities may be used to buy or invest in companies or products  possibly resulting in significant acquisition related charges to earnings and dilution to our stockholders 
due to volatile market conditions  the value of long live assets maybe negatively impacted  which may result in future  additional impairment charges 
moreover  if we buy a company  we may have to incur or assume that company s liabilities  including liabilities that are unknown at the time of acquisition 
our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products 
we continue to devote significant personnel and financial resources to research and development activities to develop new products 
we may not be successful in developing new products  and we may never realize any benefits from such research and development activities  including both our current research collaboration with pfizer and gsk and our product development consortium with pfizer and ici  which may not produce commercially viable products 
our ability to increase our revenues and achieve and sustain profitability is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop new and commercially viable products 
during  we will be launching a new product from the pfizer and ici consortium  the advantage series workstation  and this product is important to our ability to increase revenues in and beyond 
our failure to achieve our anticipated levels of revenues for this product will harm our ability to achieve our financial goals during our products have lengthy sales cycles  which could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
our ability to obtain customers for our products depends in significant part upon the perception that our products can help accelerate efforts in chemical development 
the sale of many of our products typically involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital by customers 
accordingly  the sales cycles of many of our products are lengthy and subject to a number of risks that are beyond our control  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews 
our revenues could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  due to this lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle 
a large portion of our expenses  including expenses for facilities  equipment and personnel  are relatively fixed 
accordingly  if our revenues decline or do not grow as we anticipate  we might not be able to correspondingly reduce our operating expenses 
our failure to achieve our anticipated levels of revenues could significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our operating results  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not always a good indication of our future performance 
the capital spending policies of pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and other chemical research organizations have a significant effect on the demand for our instruments 
we market our products to and receive our revenues principally from pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and other chemical research organizations  and the capital spending policies of these entities can have a significant effect on the demand for our instruments 
these policies are based on a wide variety of factors  including the resources available for purchasing research equipment  the spending priorities among various types of research equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures 
in particular  the volatility of the public stock market for biotechnology and related companies has at certain times significantly impacted their ability to raise capital  which has directly affected their capital spending budgets 
in addition  continued 
table of contents consolidation within these industries will likely delay and may potentially reduce capital spending by pharmaceutical companies involved in such consolidations 
any decrease or delay in capital spending by life sciences companies could cause our revenues to decline and harm our profitability 
in order to be successful  we must recruit  retain and motivate key employees  and failure to do so could seriously harm us 
in order to be successful  we must recruit  retain and motivate executives and other key employees  including those in managerial  technical  marketing and sales positions 
in particular  our product generation efforts depend on hiring and retaining qualified technical personnel 
attracting and retaining qualified sales representatives is also critical to our future 
experienced management and technical  marketing and support personnel in the chemistry instrumentation and consumables industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense  although the slowing economic situation during has moderated somewhat this demand and competition for talent 
the loss of key employees could have a significant impact on our operations 
we also must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on argonaut s strategies and goals  which may be particularly difficult due to morale challenges posed by workforce reductions and general uncertainty 
changes in management may be disruptive to our business and may result in the departure of existing employees  customers and or research collaborators 
it may take significant time to locate  retain and integrate qualified management personnel 
our direct worldwide sales force and network of distributors may not be sufficient to successfully address the market for our products 
we sell a major portion of our products through our own sales force 
we may not be able to build an efficient and effective sales and marketing force and continue to expand our network of distributors 
our failure to build an efficient and effective sales and marketing force could negatively impact sales of our products  thus reducing our revenues and profitability 
because we outsource our instrument component  chemical intermediates and product manufacturing  our ability to produce and supply our products could be impaired 
we outsource most of the production of components of our instruments to vendors 
we also outsource significant quantities of our high volume chemical intermediates for our consumables products 
our reliance on our outside vendors exposes us to risks including the possibility that one or more of our vendors could terminate their services at any time without notice  reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery  due to the difficulties in switching to alternative vendors  and the potential delays and expenses of seeking alternative sources of manufacturing services 
consequently  in the event that components from our suppliers or work performed by our vendors are delayed or interrupted for any reason  our ability to produce and deliver our products in sufficient quantities and at acceptable costs would decline 
additionally  certain components are provided by a single source 
the effect of a disruption of delivery of those single source components could impact our ability to deliver product to our customers 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
approximately of our net sales are exposed to foreign currency risk 
approximately of our operating expenses are exposed to foreign currency risk 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
the use of the euro as a common currency for members of the european union could impact our foreign exchange exposure 
we will monitor our exposure and may hedge against this and any other emerging market currencies as necessary 

table of contents we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers 
due to the current slowdown in the economy  the credit risks relating to our customers have increased 
although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risk  there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 
we have experienced losses due to customers failing to meet their obligations 
although these losses have not been significant  future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial conditions 
our business is subject to risks from international operations 
we conduct business globally 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including  among others  foreign currency exchange rates  regulatory  political  or economic conditions in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements  and natural disasters 
any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our future international business 
our business is subject to the effects of general economic conditions in the united states  the united kingdom and globally  and  in particular  market conditions in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and chemical industries 
in recent quarters  our operating results have been adversely affected as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending in the united states  europe  and asia 
if the economic conditions in the united states and globally do not improve  or if we experience a worsening in the global economic slowdown  we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
the life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change  and we may not have the resources necessary to successfully compete 
we compete with companies worldwide that are engaged in the development and production of similar products 
we face competition primarily from the following three sectors companies marketing conventional products based on traditional chemistry methodologies  such as biotage a subsidiary of dyax corp 
and isco  inc pharmaceutical companies developing their own instruments  and companies marketing products based upon parallel synthesis and other innovative technologies  such as mettler toledo ag and several smaller instrument and reagent companies 
many of our competitors have access to greater financial  technical  research  marketing  sales  distribution  service and other resources than we do 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from organizations serving the life sciences industry that are developing or marketing competing products and technologies 
these organizations may develop products or technologies that are superior to our products or technologies in terms of performance  cost or both 
these organizations may offer price discounts or other concessions as a competitive tactic that we may not be in a position to match 
we will need to develop new applications for our products to remain competitive 
our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances of one or more of our current or future competitors 
in addition  the introduction or announcement of new products by us or by others could result in a delay of or decrease in sales of existing products  as customers evaluate these new products 
our future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively against current technology as well as to respond effectively to technological advances 
if we infringe on or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others or we are unable to protect our own intellectual property rights our revenues could be harmed 
we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others 
intellectual property litigation is costly  and  even if we prevail  the cost of such litigation could affect our profitability 
in addition  litigation is time consuming and could divert management attention and resources away from our business 
if we do not 
table of contents prevail in any litigation  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license 
we may not be able to obtain required licenses on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  some licenses may be nonexclusive  and therefore  our competitors may have access to the technology licensed to us 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products  which could harm our ability to compete and result in a decline in our revenues 
our success may depend on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our trade secrets 
any patents we own may not afford meaningful protection for our technology and products 
others may challenge our patents and  as a result  our patents could be narrowed  invalidated or rendered unenforceable 
in addition  our current and future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents to us in the united states or foreign countries 
moreover  competitors may develop products similar to ours that are not covered by our patents 
we try to protect our non patented trade secrets by requiring our employees  consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements 
however  we cannot guarantee that these agreements will provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets 
further  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary information and techniques  our ability to exclude certain competitors from the market will be limited 
there may not be an active  liquid trading market for our common stock 
during the fourth quarter of we transferred from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
there is no guarantee that an active trading market for our common stock will be maintained on the nasdaq smallcap market 
you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our stock is not active 
if we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market  we may be de listed from trading on such market  and thereafter trading in our common stock  if any  would be conducted through the over the counter market or on the electronic bulletin board of the national association of securities dealers  inc our stock price has been highly volatile  and your investment could suffer a further decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and ranged in from a per share high of to a low of and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  failure to achieve  or changes in  financial estimates by securities analysts  announcements of new products or services or technological innovations by us or our competitors  conditions or trends in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  life sciences and chemical industries  announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  including any directors  developments in the application or interpretation of new or existing accounting pronouncements and reporting obligations purchases or sales of our common stock  including any repurchases of our common stock under the existing or future stock repurchase program  and developments regarding our patents or other intellectual property or that of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq stock market s national market and smallcap market and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced significant price 
table of contents and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
further  there has been particular volatility in the market prices of securities of life science companies 
these broad market and industry factors may negatively impact the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
our principal stockholders  directors and executive officers own approximately of our common stock  which may prevent new investors from influencing corporate decisions 
our principal stockholders  those who currently own or greater of our common stock  together with our directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
they will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control of us even if beneficial to our other stockholders 
sales of large numbers of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur 
in addition  these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock 
all of the shares sold in our initial public offering are now freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the securities act  except for any shares purchased by our affiliates  as defined in rule of the securities act 
the remaining shares of common stock outstanding are restricted securities as defined in rule these shares may be sold in the future without registration under the securities act  to the extent permitted by rule or other exemptions under the securities act 
on march   we issued  shares of unregistered common stock in connection with the acquisition of atsi 
on february   we registered  shares of common stock that are reserved for issuance upon exercise of options granted under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
these shares can be sold in the public market upon issuance  subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by affiliates 
on february   we issued  shares of unregistered common stock in connection with the acquisition of jones group 
anti takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under delaware law could make a third party acquisition of us difficult 
pursuant to our charter  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote of action by our stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain other provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so might be deemed beneficial by our stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we are also subject to certain provisions of delaware law that could delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us 

table of contents recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices 
that act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to rule proposals already made  and nasdaq has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
we expect these developments to increase our legal compliance costs  and to make some activities more time consuming 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk is related principally to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate investments may have their fair market value adversely impacted from changes in interest rates and floating rate investments may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations 
further  we may suffer losses in investment principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in debt instruments of high quality corporate issuers
