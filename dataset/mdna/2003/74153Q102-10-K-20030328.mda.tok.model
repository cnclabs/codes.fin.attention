item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this annual report 
the following information contains forward looking statements 
please read forward looking statements for a discussion of certain limitations inherent in such statements 
overview we provide contract drilling and related services to oil and gas companies worldwide  operating both offshore and on land 
as of march   we operated a global fleet of rigs  including two ultra deepwater drillships  semisubmersible rigs  jackup rigs  tender assisted  barge and platform rigs and land based drilling and workover rigs 
we operate in more than countries and marine provinces 
we have five principal operating segments gulf of mexico  international offshore  international land  e p services and technical services 
in recent years  we have expanded our offshore drilling fleet and increased the number of rigs capable of drilling in deeper waters 
we have a ownership interest in and operate two ultra deepwater drillships  the pride africa and the pride angola  that were placed in service in october and may  respectively 
in november  we acquired a jackup drilling rig  the pride ohio  which we had been operating under a bareboat charter since in february  we purchased two semisubmersible drilling rigs  now the pride venezuela and the pride north sea 
in march  we increased our ownership from to in two newly built  dynamically positioned  deepwater semisubmersible drilling rigs  the pride carlos walter and the pride brazil 
the pride carlos walter and pride brazil commenced operations offshore brazil in june and july  respectively  working under five year charter and service rendering contracts 
in september  we acquired marine drilling companies  inc in a stock for stock transaction that created one of the world s largest offshore drilling contractors 
marine owned and operated a fleet of offshore drilling rigs consisting of two semisubmersible units and jackup units 
additionally  marine owned one jackup rig configured as an accommodation unit 
we issued million shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of marine  which equaled approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock immediately following completion of the acquisition 
the combination with marine has enhanced our competitive position in the gulf of mexico jackup rig market and elsewhere 
the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests for accounting and financial reporting purposes and  accordingly  our consolidated financial statements for each period prior to the merger reflect the combined operations of pride and marine 
in  we acquired land based drilling and workover rigs in argentina and venezuela for a total cost of million 
in october  we acquired uniao nacional de perfuracao limitada unap for aggregate consideration of million 
unap manages one land based drilling rig and seven land based workover rigs and provides directional drilling and other related services onshore brazil 
we expect to continue to redeploy assets to more active regions and to explore opportunities to expand our operations through acquisitions and rig upgrades from time to time 
business environment and outlook general our revenues depend principally upon the number of available drilling and workover rigs  the number of days these rigs are utilized and the day rates received  the amount of integrated project management  coiled tubing drilling and other e p services we provide and the amount of technical services projects that we manage 
the number of available rigs may increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs  the construction of new rigs  the number of rigs being upgraded or repaired at any time and the entering into or termination of rig management contracts 
the number of days our rig fleets are utilized and the day rates received are largely dependent upon the balance of supply and demand for drilling and workover services in the different geographic regions in which we operate 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher day rates  we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another 
oil and gas companies exploration and development drilling programs drive the demand for drilling  workover and related services 
these drilling programs are affected by their expectations about oil and natural gas prices  anticipated production levels  demand for crude oil and natural gas products  government regulations and many other factors 
oil and gas prices are volatile  which has historically led to significant fluctuations in expenditures for oil and gas drilling and related services 
please read business risk factors in item of this annual report 
gulf of mexico prices for natural gas increased during and early  which had a favorable impact on utilization  day rates and demand for our services in the gulf of mexico 
from mid  however  activity in the us gulf of mexico began to weaken  and in the fourth quarter of and throughout  we experienced particularly weak conditions in the us gulf of mexico jackup and platform rig markets as high natural gas inventory storage levels resulted in reduced demand for rig services 
in response to these poor market conditions  we actively marketed a number of rigs in our us gulf of mexico fleet to international markets 
during  we obtained long term contracts for nine jackup rigs and one platform rig with pemex in the mexican sector of the gulf of mexico and for two jackup rigs in other international markets  one in nigeria and one in india 
additionally  we have obtained a long term contract with pemex in mexico for the pride south seas  a semisubmersible rig that we mobilized from south africa 
the following table summarizes average daily revenue and percentage utilization for our gulf of mexico jackup and available platform rig fleets for each of the last three years 
in this annual report  average daily revenue information is based on total revenues for each rig type divided by actual days worked by all rigs of that type 
percentage utilization is calculated as the total days worked divided by the total days available for work by all rigs of that type 
daily revenue utilization daily revenue utilization daily revenue utilization jackup rigs    platform rigs    as of march   nine of our gulf of mexico jackups were working offshore mexico on contracts with an average remaining term of two and one half years and an average day rate of  seven were working in the us gulf of mexico  of which six were on short term contracts  with an average day rate of  and nine rigs were available 
additionally  two of our platform rigs were working offshore mexico on contracts with an average day rate of  and two were working in the us gulf of mexico at an average day rate of  of the remaining platform rigs  two are being mobilized for customer contracts beginning in april and one has been committed to a customer 
although natural gas prices have recently increased significantly and natural gas storage levels have declined dramatically  demand for drilling services in the us gulf of mexico has shown only a marginal improvement to date 
our current expectation is that sustained natural gas prices at current levels will lead to increased activity levels and day rates in the us gulf of mexico in the second half of our available jackup rigs have been well maintained and could be put back into service at minimal cost 
as a result  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of any upturn in demand in this market 
we expect that revenues and gross margins derived from our entire gulf of mexico operations in will exceed those for due to the impact of a full year of operations for our rigs working in mexico even if market conditions remain at their current depressed levels in the us sector of the gulf 
international offshore our international offshore segment has continued to experience high levels of activity  and we maintained essentially full utilization of six of our seven high specification deepwater rigs during the seventh deepwater rig  the pride south pacific  completed a contract in april and underwent upgrades before commencing a new contract offshore angola at the end of november the new contract is expected to last approximately one year 
all of these high specification rigs are working on long term development projects and are expected to achieve nearly utilization in the pride south america semisubmersible rig  however  received its five year periodic inspection and related maintenance in the first quarter of and was out of service for approximately days 
our intermediate water depth semisubmersibles experienced approximately utilization in with most of the non chargeable time due to scheduled periodic inspections and to time preparing for and mobilizing to new contracts 
we currently expect a similar or slightly improved level of activity for these rigs in following the mobilization of the jackup rigs pride north dakota and the pride west virginia to nigeria and india  respectively  in the second half of under two year contracts  we currently have eight jackup rigs working in international waters outside of the gulf of mexico 
all of these rigs are currently working under long term contracts 
additionally  we manage two jackup rigs on behalf of pdvsa in venezuela under contracts that expire in june the following table summarizes average daily revenue and percentage utilization by type of rig for our international offshore rigs for the last three years 
daily revenue utilization daily revenue utilization daily revenue utilization drillships semisubmersible rigs    jackup rigs    tender and barge rigs    international land during  our international land operations were adversely affected by the economic and political instability in argentina and venezuela 
the argentine peso declined in value against the us dollar following the argentine government s decision to abandon the country s fixed dollar to peso exchange rate at the end of the devaluation  coupled with the government s mandated conversion of all dollar based contracts to pesos  severely pressured our margins 
as a result  we recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of of million  net of estimated income taxes  to reduce the carrying value of our net monetary assets in argentina 
during the first quarter of  we engaged in discussions with all of our argentine customers regarding recovery of losses sustained from the devaluation of accounts receivable and the basis on which new business would be contracted 
we restructured most of our contracts on a basis that we believe limits our exposure to further devaluations 
activity levels slowly recovered in argentina during the second half of as high oil prices positively impacted our customers cash flows and have continued to improve subsequent to year end 
the average rate of utilization of our drilling and workover rig fleets in argentina was in  down from in and in as of march    or  of our total fleet of drilling and workover rigs in argentina were under contract 
in  million  or approximately  of our consolidated revenues were derived from land and offshore drilling  workover and e p services in venezuela  which has been experiencing political  economic and social instability 
a prolonged strike by pdvsa employees has led to the dismissal of more than  employees by the government 
while the recent turmoil in venezuela is likely to lead to increased demand at some time in the future for integrated project management services as well as workover services to repair wells that have been shut in  it has led to a reduction in our level of operations in that country during the first quarter of since the conclusion of the strike  our rig activity level has returned to approximately the same level as before the strike 
currently  or  of our land based drilling and workover rigs and all five of our offshore rigs in venezuela are under contract 
venezuela has also recently implemented exchange controls which  together with recent employee dismissals and reorganization within pdvsa  have led to a slower rate of collection of our trade receivables and could limit our ability to convert local currency to us dollars and transfer funds out of the country 
our billed trade receivables in venezuela have increased from million at december  to million as of february  management believes that all such receivables will be recovered and that the recently implemented exchange controls will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the effect of reduced activity in our land drilling and workover markets in south america was partially offset by increased activity in africa  where five newly constructed mobile land rigs started work in chad in december and early under contracts with exxonmobil with initial terms ranging from five to seven years 
additionally  activity increased in russia  where a horsepower land rig worked throughout following its relocation from argentina to western siberia in late in we mobilized the first of two large land rigs to kazakhstan 
the rig has been earning a standby rate since being accepted by the customer in november and will commence drilling on an artificial island in the caspian sea after the spring thaw that is expected to occur in april the second rig is currently being shipped to kazakhstan and is expected to commence drilling operations early in the third quarter of e p services our e p services activity is generated predominately in south america and was negatively impacted by the crises in argentina and venezuela in revenues and gross margins have  however  recovered steadily throughout the year from a low point in the second quarter of as activity in argentina has recovered 
revenues from e p services are expected to improve in in part due to expansion into new markets 
technical services prior to  our technical services group conducted its activities almost exclusively for pride s operating groups 
its projects included the design  engineering and construction of new rigs  including the pride africa and pride angola drillships  and the design and management of major rig upgrades and maintenance projects 
the technical services group is currently providing design  engineering and construction management services to our customers on a remunerated basis 
the technical services group has five major projects ongoing to design  engineer  manage construction of and commission deepwater platform drilling rigs  which are being constructed on behalf of two major oil company customers 
we will also provide drilling operations management of the rig packages once they have been installed on the deepwater platforms  which include spars  tension leg platforms and other designs

operating costs 
operating costs in increased million  or  as compared to the increase was principally due to costs related to the newly acquired or constructed semisubmersible rigs  to increased costs of rigs that operated during that were being upgraded or were stacked in  to costs for a full period in for the pride angola and the e p services division as compared with partial periods in and to costs associated with integrated project management services and coiled tubing drilling 
depreciation and amortization

our current ratio  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities  was at both december  and december  the increase in net working capital was attributable primarily to an increase in cash received from our issuance of million principal amount of convertible senior notes in march and from borrowings of million under our new senior secured bank term loan  net of amounts used to retire other bank debt and repurchase our zero coupon convertible debentures 
in june  we entered into senior secured credit facilities with a group of banks providing for aggregate availability of up to million  consisting of a five year million term loan and a three year million revolving credit facility

borrowings under the revolving credit facility are available for general corporate purposes 
as of december   million of borrowings and an additional million of letters of credit were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the facilities are collateralized by two deepwater semisubmersible rigs  the pride north america and the pride south pacific  and jackup rigs 
borrowings under the facilities currently bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus a spread based on the credit rating of the facility or  if unrated  index debt 
as of march   the spread was for the term loan and for the revolving credit facility

the loans are secured by the two drillships and the proceeds from the related drilling contracts and are non recourse to us and the joint owner 
as of december   a total of million was outstanding under these loans 
as a condition of the drillship loans  we entered into interest rate swap and cap agreements 
the agreements effectively fixed the interest rate on the pride africa loan at through december  effectively fixed the interest rate on the pride angola loan at through january and effectively capped the interest rate on the pride angola loan at from february to january in february  we purchased a second generation semisubmersible drilling rig now the pride north sea and a third generation semisubmersible drilling rig now the pride venezuela for million in cash and million shares of our common stock valued at million 
in march  we increased from to our ownership in a joint venture that constructed two dynamically positioned  deepwater semisubmersible drilling rigs 
the pride carlos walter commenced operations in june  and the pride brazil commenced operations in july these rigs are operating for petrobras under five year charter and service rendering contracts  each with two one year extension options 
the purchase consideration for the interests we did not previously own consisted of approximately million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes  which were issued to the brazilian participant in the joint venture  and  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million  which were issued to two investment funds managed by first reserve corporation pursuant to the funds original investment in the joint venture

we also had aggregate availability under our senior credit facilities of million as of december  although we do not expect that our level of total indebtedness will have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity in future periods  it may limit our flexibility in certain areas 
please read risk factors we may be considered highly leveraged 
our significant debt levels and debt agreement restrictions may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities in item of this annual report 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december payments due by period up to over contractual cash obligations year years years years total in millions principal payments on long term debt  interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases rigs total cash obligations   does not include unconditional purchase commitments to third parties for materials  goods and services incurred in the normal course of business 
assumes that we purchase million principal amount at maturity of the outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures for cash on their initial put dates  including million principal amount at maturity of our zero coupon convertible senior debentures purchased in january for million  which was funded by borrowings under our existing senior credit facilities 
the remaining million principal amount at maturity of our zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures may  at the option of holders  be put to us in april at an accreted price of million  which we expect to fund by additional borrowings under our existing senior credit facilities and by available cash 
primarily related to the pride south america semisubmersible rig 
in addition to rig operating leases  we have operating leases for other equipment  vehicles and various facilities 
rental expense under all operating leases for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
we own a equity interest in a joint venture company that is constructing two dynamically positioned deepwater semisubmersible drilling rigs  currently referred to as the amethyst and amethyst the rigs are being constructed at a shipyard in maine  and we anticipate that they will be completed in late the joint venture company has financed of the cost of construction of those rigs through credit facilities  with repayment of the borrowings under those facilities guaranteed by the united states maritime administration marad 
advances under the credit facilities are being provided without recourse to any of the joint venture owners 
the remaining of the cost of construction is being provided by the joint venture company from equity contributions that have been made by the joint venture partners 
through december   our equity contributions to the joint venture totaled million  including capitalized interest of million 
based on the availability of funds under performance and payment bonds issued on behalf of a prior construction contractor and draws remaining under the marad guaranteed credit facilities  we believe the amethyst and amethyst will be completed without requiring additional contributions by the joint venture partners 
in october  the two first reserve managed funds that collectively held an interest in the joint venture transferred their interests to us in exchange for a total of  share of our common stock 
the other joint venture partner exercised its option to acquire up to of the interest we acquired in the first reserve exchange  which reduced our interest to 
the exercise price of that option was  shares of our common stock 
as a result of the exchange and other purchases of our common stock by first reserve managed funds  first reserve funds owned as of december  approximately million shares of our common stock  or approximately of the total shares outstanding 
the amethyst and amethyst are being built to operate under long term charter and service rendering contracts with petrobras  however  petrobras has given notice of cancellation of those contracts for late delivery 
we believe that petrobras or another customer will employ the amethyst and amethyst under new or amended contracts 
there can be no assurance  however  that either the amethyst or amethyst will be chartered to petrobras or to any other customer 
we established the pride international  inc direct stock purchase plan in  which provides a convenient way for investors to purchase shares of our common stock without paying brokerage commissions or service charges 
during  we sold approximately million shares of common stock under this plan for net proceeds of million 
no shares were sold under the plan in as of december   million of our cash balances  which amount is included in restricted cash  consists of funds held in trust in connection with our drillship and semisubmersible loans and our limited recourse collateralized term loans and  accordingly  is not currently available for our use 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand  together with the cash generated from our operations and borrowings under our credit facilities  will be adequate to fund normal ongoing capital expenditures  working capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
we expect to continue to redeploy assets to more active regions and to explore opportunities to expand our operations through acquisitions and rig upgrades from time to time 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable 
from time to time  we have one or more bids outstanding for contracts that could require significant capital expenditures and mobilization costs 
we expect to fund acquisitions and project opportunities primarily through a combination of working capital  cash flow from operations and full or limited recourse debt or equity financing 
tax matters we have a us deferred tax asset of million relating to us net operating loss nol carryforwards 
due to the acquisition of marine  certain nol carryforwards are subject to limitation under sections and of the us internal revenue code 
we have determined that such limitations should not affect our ability to realize the benefits associated with such nol carryforwards 
the us nol carryforwards total million and expire in through we estimate that we will generate sufficient us taxable income of approximately million prior to the expiration dates of these nol carryforwards to fully utilize them 
historically  the difference between financial income loss and taxable income loss is primarily due to accelerated tax depreciation 
tax depreciation in excess of book depreciation for the years ended december    and was million  million  million and million  respectively 
we also have argentine deferred tax assets of million consisting primarily of nol carryforwards 
we expect to generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize these nol carryforwards 
if the income from these operations is not sufficient to create sufficient taxable income to utilize nol carryforwards  tax planning strategies exist that we believe would permit us to utilize these nol carryforwards 
the argentina nol carryforwards total million and expire in through significant accounting policies we consider policies concerning use of estimates  property and equipment  revenue recognition  periodic inspections and surveys and foreign currency translation to have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  including realization of customer and insurance receivables and resolutions of tax claims 
while we believe that such estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
property and equipment are carried at original cost or adjusted net realizable value  as applicable 
major renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the respective asset s remaining useful life 
maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred 
when assets are sold or retired  the remaining costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income 
property and equipment held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
indicators of possible impairment include extended periods of idle time and or an inability to contract specific assets or groups of assets  such as a specific type of drilling rig  or assets in a specific geographical region 
however  the drilling  workover and related service industries in which we operate are highly cyclical and it is not unusual to find that assets that were idle  underutilized or contracted at sub economic rates for significant periods of time resume activity at economic rates when market conditions improve 
additionally  most of our assets are mobile and we may mobilize rigs from one market to another to improve utilization or realize higher day rates 
we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected assets to determine the recoverability of carrying amounts 
in general  analyses are based on expected costs  utilization and day rates for the estimated remaining useful lives of the asset or group of assets being assessed 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets  and reflect management s assumptions and judgements regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  day rates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets 
we recognize revenue as services are performed based upon contracted day rates and the number of operating days during the period 
revenue from turnkey contracts is generally recognized upon completion 
anticipated losses on turnkey contracts are recognized in operating results when known 
mobilization fees received and costs incurred to mobilize a rig in connection with a customer contract from one geographic area to another are deferred and recognized over the term of such contract 
construction contract revenues and related costs are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
fees received for capital improvements to rigs or other property and equipment are deferred and recognized over the period of the related drilling contract 
the costs of such capital improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the useful lives of the assets 
we are required to obtain certifications from various regulatory bodies in order to operate our offshore drilling rigs and must maintain such certifications through periodic inspections and surveys 
the costs associated with obtaining and maintaining such certifications  including inspections and surveys  drydock costs and remedial structural work to the rigs are deferred and amortized over the corresponding certification periods 
we account for translation of foreign currency in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
the majority of our revenues and expenditures are denominated in us dollars to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  resulting in the use of the us dollar as the functional currency 
in addition  our operations in certain foreign jurisdictions are in highly inflationary economies resulting in the use of the us dollar as the functional currency 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at historical exchange rates  revenues and expenses in these countries are translated at the average rate of exchange for the period  and all translation gains or losses are reflected in the period s results of operations 
in those countries where the us dollar is not the functional currency  revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange for the period  assets and liabilities are translated at end of period exchange rates and all translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and requires that goodwill be reviewed annually for impairment 
we ceased amortizing goodwill on january  we performed an impairment test of goodwill at year end and determined that the fair value exceeded the recorded cost as of december   accordingly  no impairment was recorded

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
these risks arise primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuation in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
we entered into these instruments other than for trading purposes 
we incorporate by reference in response to this item the information set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through our convertible and fixed rate long term debt 
we have entered into agreements as required by the lenders under certain loan and credit agreements that effectively fixed or capped the interest rate on such debt 
as of december   we held interest rate swap and cap agreements covering million of our long term debt 
the fair market value of fixed rate debt will increase as prevailing interest rates decrease 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices where applicable  or based on the present value of expected cash flows relating to the debt discounted at rates currently available to us for long term borrowings with similar terms and maturities 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt as of december  and was approximately  million and  million  respectively  which is more than its carrying value as of december  and of  million and  million  respectively 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates relative to market interest rates at december  would increase the fair market value of our long term debt at december  by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we operate in a number of international areas and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars  which expose us to foreign exchange rate risk 
we utilize forward exchange and option contracts  local currency borrowings and the payment structure of customer contracts to selectively reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies 
the estimated unrealized loss on our forward exchange and option contracts as of december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical increase in the us dollar relative to the euro as of december  would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts 
we do not hold or issue forward exchange contracts  option contracts or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
