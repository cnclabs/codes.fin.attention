item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein 
overview our primary sources of revenue are net interest income and noninterest income 
net interest income is the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
we generate interest income from our loan portfolio  which consists of consumer  mortgage and commercial loans  and from investments in mortgage backed securities and other short term investments 
we fund our loan portfolio and investments with deposits  advances from the fhlb  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  securitizations  other borrowings and equity 
noninterest income is primarily made up of revenues generated from the sale and servicing of contracts and real estate loans 
the primary components of noninterest income include late charges and other collection related fee income on managed contracts  retained interest income or expense  gain on sale of contracts and real estate loans  and contractual specified servicing income on contracts in securitization transactions treated as sales for accounting purposes 
since march  we have structured our securitizations as secured financings and no longer record non cash gain on sale or subsequent contractual servicing and retained interest income 
instead  the earnings of the contracts in the trust and the related financing costs are reflected over the life of the underlying pool of contracts as net interest income 
other components of noninterest income include gains and losses from the sale of investment securities and mortgage backed securities  gains from the sale of deposits and premises  insurance income  fees related to the sales of investment products such as mutual funds and annuities and fee income from depository accounts 
the primary components of noninterest expense are salaries  credit and collection expenses and data processing costs 
critical accounting policies management believes critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require difficult and complex judgments because they rely on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain due to the impact of changing market conditions 
the following is a summary of accounting policies we consider critical 
retained interest in securitized assets automobile contract asset backed securitization transactions are treated as either sales or secured financings for accounting purposes depending upon the securitization structure 
in september  the financial accounting standards board  also known as the fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  also known as sfas no 
 to replace statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  also known as sfas no 
sfas no 
revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures  but it generally carries over most of sfas no 
s provisions without reconsideration 
sfas no 
defines the criteria used to evaluate securitization structures in determining the proper accounting treatment 
these criteria pertain to whether or not the transferor has surrendered control over the transferred assets 
if a securitization transaction meets all the criteria defined in sfas no 
 the transaction is required to be treated as a sale 
if any one of the criteria is not met  the transaction is required to be treated as a secured financing 
since march   our securitization transactions included certain provisions which allow us to effectively maintain control over the transferred assets 
as a result  these securitization transactions are required to be treated as secured financings 
our securitization transactions prior to march  did not give us this right and  therefore  we were required to treat such transactions as sales 
for securitization transactions treated as sales  we recorded a non cash gain equal to the present value of the estimated future cash flows on a cash out basis  net of the write off of dealer participation and gains or 
table of contents losses on hedges 
we determined whether or not we must record a servicing asset or liability by estimating future servicing revenues  including servicing fees  late charges  other ancillary income and float benefit  less the actual cost to service the loans 
in determining the fair value of our retained interest in securitized assets  also known as risa  we evaluated the cost basis of contracts relative to the fair value of such contracts and the fair value of the risa recorded 
the risa was capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the underlying contracts 
net interest income and servicing fees earned on these contracts are recognized over the life of the securitization transactions as contractual servicing income  retained interest income and other fee income 
the amortization of the risa is calculated so as to recognize retained interest income on an effective yield basis 
these amounts are reported as automobile lending income on our consolidated statements of income 
risa is classified in a manner similar to available for sale securities and as such was marked to market each quarter 
market value changes were calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows using the current market discount rate 
any changes in the market value of the risa were reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluated the carrying value of the risa in light of the actual performance of the underlying contracts and made adjustments to reduce the carrying value  if appropriate 
for securitization transactions treated as secured financings  the contracts are retained on the balance sheet with the securities issued to finance the contracts recorded as notes payable on automobile secured financing 
we record interest income on the securitized contracts and interest expense on the notes issued through the securitization transactions 
the excess cash flows generated by securitized contracts are deposited into spread accounts in the name of the trustee under the terms of the securitization transactions 
in addition  we advance additional monies to initially fund these spread accounts 
for securitization transactions treated as sales  amounts due to us held in the spread accounts and servicing income earned by us for which we have not yet received repayment from the trust are reported as amounts due from trust on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
as servicer of these contracts  we hold and remit funds collected from the borrowers on behalf of the trustee pursuant to reinvestment contracts that we have entered into for most securitizations 
for securitization transactions treated as sales  these amounts are reported as amounts held on behalf of trustee on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
allowance for credit losses management determines the amount of the allowance for credit losses based on a review of various quantitative and qualitative analyses 
quantitative analyses include the review of chargeoff trends by loan program and loan type on an owned and managed basis  analysis of cumulative losses on both a managed and sold basis  and evaluation of credit loss experience by credit tier and geographic location 
other quantitative analyses include the evaluation of the size of any particular asset group  the concentration of any credit tier  the level of nonperformance and the percentage of delinquency 
qualitative analyses include trends in chargeoffs over various time periods and at various statistical midpoints and high points  the severity of depreciated values of repossessions or foreclosures  trends in the number of days repossessions are held in inventory  trends in the number of loan modifications  trends in delinquency roll rates  trends in deficiency balance collections both internally and from collection agencies  trends in custom scores and the effectiveness of our custom scores  and trends in the economy generally or in specific geographic locations 
despite these analyses  we recognize that establishing allowance for credit losses is not an exact science and can be highly judgmental in nature 
the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is not only dependent upon effective quantitative and qualitative analyses  but also effective loan review and asset classification 
we classify our assets in accordance with regulatory guidance 
our multifamily and commercial loan portfolios are evaluated individually while our single family and consumer portfolios are evaluated in pools 
we classify our loan 
table of contents portfolios into five categories pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
based upon our asset classifications  we establish general and specific valuation allowances 
general valuation allowances are determined by applying various factors to loan balances that are classified as pass  special mention  substandard or doubtful 
specific valuation allowances represent loan amounts that are classified as loss 
some assets may be split into more than one asset classification due to fair value or net realizable value calculations 
this approach allows for enhanced analysis as it highlights the need for more allowance than would be generally allocated if held in one classification 
all contracts that are to days delinquent are automatically classified as special mention 
real estate loans that are manifesting a weakness in performance are classified as special mention 
any contract that is or more days delinquent is automatically classified as substandard 
real estate loans that are manifesting a significant weakness in performance are also classified as substandard 
any multifamily loan that is impaired is classified as substandard 
any contract where the borrower has filed for bankruptcy or where the vehicle has been repossessed by us and is subject to a redemption period is classified as substandard  with the difference between the wholesale book value and loan balance classified as loss 
the allowance for credit losses is reduced by net chargeoffs as well as decreases in required allowances due to sales of loans and by lowering the level of required reserves based upon improved loan performance 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by recording amounts to the provision for credit losses 
derivatives and hedging activities deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase we may enter into cash flow hedges that will protect against potential changes in interest rates affecting interest payments on future deposits gathered by us and future securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is included in deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  respectively  and any change in the fair value is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
related interest income or expense is settled on a quarterly basis and is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the period during which cash flows on the hedged items affect income 
notes payable on automobile secured financing the contracts originated and held by us are fixed rate and  accordingly  we have exposure to changes in interest rates 
to protect against potential changes in interest rates affecting interest payments on future securitization transactions  we may enter into various hedge agreements prior to closing the transaction 
the market value of these hedge agreements is designed to respond inversely to changes in interest rates 
because of this inverse relationship  we can effectively lock in a gross interest rate spread at the time of entering into the hedge transaction 
gains and losses on these agreements are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
any ineffective portion is recognized in interest expense during that period if the hedge is greater than effective 
upon completion of the securitization transaction  the gains or losses are recognized in full as an adjustment to the gain or loss on the sale of the contracts if the securitization transaction is treated as a sale or amortized on a level yield basis over the duration of the notes issued if the transaction is treated as a secured financing 
if we issue certain variable rate notes payable in connection with our securitization activities  we may also enter into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge our variable interest rate exposure on future interest payments 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is included in notes payable on automobile secured financing  and any change in the fair value is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
any ineffective portion is recorded in interest expense during that period if the hedge is greater than effective 
related interest income or expense is settled on a quarterly basis and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents we also enter into interest rate swap agreements or other derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  also known as sfas no 
 or that we choose not to designate as hedges 
these derivatives pertain to variable rate notes issued in conjunction with the securitization of our contracts 
any change in the market value of such derivatives is recorded to noninterest income each month 
any noninterest income or expense recognized on such derivatives is recognized as miscellaneous noninterest income or expense 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is affected by the difference between the rate earned on our interest earning assets and the rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread and the relative amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income totaled million in compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in net interest income in is primarily the result of us holding a greater percentage of contracts on balance sheet as we utilized our own liquidity sources and completed public securitizations totaling billion and a conduit financing totaling million accounted for as secured financings and as we experienced wider net interest margins on the loans originated during our decision to account for our securitizations as secured financings by changing the structure of our securitizations was based upon a business philosophy that focuses on presenting high quality  cash based earnings and maintaining a conservative  well capitalized balance sheet 
in order to defeat sale treatment  some of our securitization transactions include a provision that provides us with the right to repurchase contracts at our option 
the percentage of contracts that we may repurchase was increased from to as of march other securitization transactions allow the trust to invest in other financial assets 
we believe that a presentation in which assets and liabilities remain on the balance sheet for securitization transactions treated as secured financings provides a better understanding of our business and the inherent risks associated with our securitizations 
in addition  by accounting for our securitizations as secured financings we no longer record a retained interest asset upon completion of each securitization  the valuation of which is based upon subjective assumptions 

table of contents the following table presents information relative to the average balances and interest rates on an owned basis for the periods indicated for the year ended december  average yield average yield average yield balance interest rate balance interest rate balance interest rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets total investments mortgage backed securities other short term investments investment securities interest earning deposits with others total investments total loans consumer loans mortgage loans commercial loans total loans total interest earning assets noninterest earning assets amounts due from trusts retained interest in securitized assets premises  equipment and real estate owned other assets less allowance for credit losses total interest bearing liabilities deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase fhlb advances and other borrowings notes payable on automobile secured financing subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing liabilities amounts held on behalf of trustee other liabilities shareholders equity total net interest income and interest rate spread net yield on average interest earning assets for the purpose of these computations  nonaccruing loans are included in the average loan amounts outstanding 

table of contents the total interest rate spread increased basis points for compared with due to a decrease of basis points in the yield on interest earning assets combined with a decrease in the cost of funds of basis points 
the decrease in the yield on interest earning assets in is primarily due to our shift to originating a higher percentage of prime credit quality contracts and a lower interest rate environment 
the decrease in the cost of funds in compared with is due primarily to a lower interest rate environment 
the increase in yield on interest earning assets for compared with was due primarily to a higher percentage of contracts held on the balance sheet 
the decrease in the cost of funds in compared with was due to a lower interest rate environment 
the following table sets forth the changes in net interest income attributable to changes in volume change in average portfolio volume multiplied by prior period average rate and changes in rates change in weighted average interest rate multiplied by prior period average portfolio balance compared to compared to volume rate total volume rate total dollars in thousands interest income mortgage backed securities other short term investments investment securities interest earning deposits with others total loans consumer loans mortgage loans commercial loans total interest earning assets interest expense deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase fhlb advances and other borrowings notes payable on automobile secured financings subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities net change in net interest income in the analysis of interest changes due to volume and rate  the changes due to the volume rate variance the combined effect of change in weighted average interest rate and change in average portfolio balance have been allocated proportionately based on the absolute value of the volume and rate variances 
if there was no balance in the previous year  the total change was allocated to volume 

table of contents provision for credit losses we maintain an allowance for credit losses to cover probable losses that can be reasonably estimated for the loans held on the balance sheet 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charging the provision for credit losses and decreased by actual losses on the loans or reversing the allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses when the amount of loans held on balance sheet is reduced through securitization transactions treated as sales 
the level of allowance is based principally on the outstanding balance of loans held on balance sheet and historical loss trends 
we believe that the allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to absorb probable losses in our owned loan portfolio that can be reasonably estimated 
the provision for credit losses was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net chargeoffs were million  million and million for the same respective periods 
the increase in the provision for credit losses was the result of a higher level of contracts held on balance sheet as well as higher chargeoffs due to a slowing economy 
noninterest income automobile lending income since the first quarter of  we have not completed a securitization that has been accounted for as a sale 
for transactions treated as sales prior to april  we recorded a non cash gain equal to the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the portfolio of contracts sold less the write off of dealer participation balances and the effect of hedging activities 
for these securitizations  net interest earned on the contracts sold are recognized over the life of the transactions as contractual servicing income and retained interest income or expense 
the components of automobile lending income were as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands fee income contractual servicing income retained interest expense income  net of risa amortization gain on sale of contracts total automobile lending income automobile lending income decreased primarily as a result of us no longer issuing asset backed securities that are treated as sales for accounting purposes 
this change is reflected in higher retained interest expense and lower contractual servicing income  offset by increases in fee income 

table of contents fee income consists primarily of documentation fees  late charges and deferment fees on our managed portfolio  including contracts securitized in transactions accounted for as sales and secured financings  as well as contracts not securitized 
the increase in fee income is due to the growth in our average managed portfolio to billion in from billion in and billion in according to the terms of each securitization  contractual servicing income is generally earned at rates ranging from to per annum on the outstanding balance of contracts securitized 
for accounting purposes  this income is only recognized on contracts sold through securitizations treated as sales 
contractual servicing income totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in contractual servicing income is due to the decrease in the average balance of the sold portfolio from to retained interest expense was million and million for each of the years ended december  and  respectively  compared with retained interest income of million for the year ended december  for accounting purposes  this expense or income is only recognized on contracts sold through securitizations treated as sales 
retained interest expense or income is dependent upon the average excess spread on the contracts sold  credit losses  the size of the sold portfolio and the amount of amortization of the risa 
the retained interest expense recognized in and is the result of higher chargeoff experience on our sold portfolio as well as revised estimates of future chargeoffs due to continued slowing in the economy 
net chargeoffs on the sold portfolio decreased to million in from million in and million in the outstanding sold portfolio had a weighted average gross interest rate spread of in compared with and in and  respectively 
the average balance of the sold portfolio was million in compared with billion in and billion in gain on sale  retained interest income or expense and contractual servicing income are not recognized on securitizations accounted for as secured financings 
therefore  we expect such income will not be recognized on our future securitizations 
retained interest income or expense and contractual servicing income will continue to be recognized on existing securitizations accounted for as sales until such pools are redeemed 
even as these amounts decrease  we expect net interest income will increase as we retain contracts on our balance sheet

table of contents mortgage banking income mortgage banking operations included gains and losses on the sale of loans and servicing rights and other income  primarily late charges 
during  mortgage banking income totaled million compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the decline in mortgage banking income from to is due to our decision to exit the mortgage banking business 
this decision resulted in the sale of our remaining mortgage banking operations in the components of mortgage banking income were as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands net gains from sale of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights fee income total mortgage banking income other noninterest income other noninterest income consists primarily of insurance income  which totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
insurance income includes premiums and commissions earned on insurance and insurance related products  including collateral protection and credit life insurance 
income from the sale of mutual funds and annuities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income from the sale of mutual funds and annuities is included in insurance income on the consolidated statements of income 
miscellaneous income totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
miscellaneous income in consisted of demand deposit fees  income from rental operations  and other income 
the increase in miscellaneous income from to was due to the sales of seven northern california bank branches in noninterest expense total noninterest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
noninterest expense as a percentage of total revenues improved to in compared to in and in as a result of improved operating efficiencies achieved through the centralization and automation of certain processes as well as the deployment of new technologies 
noninterest expense increased million or in compared with primarily as a result of higher collection costs due to a higher frequency of losses resulting from a slowing economy 
the efficiencies realized include increasing the conversion ratios on contracts purchased through dealer education  automating the loan application and underwriting system  increasing the percentage of applications received via the internet  outsourcing the data entry process  centralizing the verification process  and implementing proprietary credit scorecards and electronic funds transfers for our dealers 
operating efficiencies also include implementing automated dialers  centralizing and upgrading payment processing and asset recovery processes  upgrading toll free lines for customer service and interactive voice response technology  implementing direct debit for our borrowers  imaging for record retention and retrieval  and implementing a new behavioral scoring collection system 

table of contents income taxes we file federal and certain state tax returns on a consolidated basis 
other state tax returns are filed for each subsidiary separately 
our effective tax rate was in compared with and in and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is a result of a one time benefit of new legislation enacted by the state of california which eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debts for large banks and financial corporations for taxable income purposes 
in the first year of this change  of the ending reserve amount deducted from taxable income in prior periods will be included in the current year california taxable income 
the remaining of the reserve is not required to be recaptured into income  but rather represents a permanent difference between gaap and california tax accounting 
the deferred tax liability related to this permanent difference has been eliminated from our balance sheet and the current year state income tax provision has been reduced accordingly 
see business taxation 
pro forma portfolio basis statements of income during the first quarter of  we changed the structure of our securitizations so that they would no longer be accounted for as sales but rather recorded as secured financings 
this decision is consistent with our business strategy to record high quality earnings and to maintain a conservative  well capitalized balance sheet 
if treated as secured financings  no gain on sale or subsequent contractual servicing and retained interest income or expense is recognized 
instead  the earnings of the contracts in the trust  including servicing fees  and the related financing costs are reflected over the life of the underlying pool of contracts as net interest income 
additionally  no risa is recorded on the balance sheet  which must be written off over the life of a securitization 
this asset is subject to impairment if assumptions made about the performance of a securitization are not realized 
since  our securitizations that were recorded as sales have matured and an increasing percentage of securitized contracts are represented by securitizations that are accounted for as secured financings 
during the transitory period  we have presented pro forma portfolio basis statements of income that present our results under the assumption that all our outstanding securitizations are treated as secured financings rather than as sales 
these statements provided a method by which to gauge our year to year performance while we made this transition 
effective the first quarter of  we will discontinue presenting portfolio basis earnings since we have completed our transition to treating securitization transactions as secured financings rather than sales for accounting purposes and have fully amortized our residual interest assets 
the growth in our portfolio basis earnings reflects the growth in our managed contract portfolio to billion at december   compared with billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we monitor the periodic portfolio basis earnings of our managed contract portfolio and believe these portfolio basis statements assist in better understanding our business

though we continue to focus on expanding our commercial banking operation  it was not a significant source of revenues for the year ended december  amounts due from trusts the excess cash flows generated by contracts sold to each of the securitization trusts is deposited into spread accounts in the name of the trustee under the terms of the securitizations treated as sales 
in addition  at the time a securitization closes  we advance additional monies to our subsidiary that originated the securitization trust to initially fund these spread accounts 
as these spread accounts reach the balances required by the trust  excess amounts are released to us and are used to pay down these amounts 
the amounts due from trusts represent initial advances made to spread accounts and excess cash flows that are still under obligation to be held in the spread accounts for securitizations treated as sales 
the amounts due from trusts at december  was million compared with million at december  the decrease is the result of a reduction in the outstanding amount of securitizations treated as sales for accounting purposes 
amounts due from trusts is expected to continue to decline in retained interest in securitized assets none of our securitizations in or were treated as sales 
therefore  we did not record any retained interest in securitized assets

such amounts will not be realized unless the risa is sold 
changes in prepayment and credit loss assumptions for the risa are other than temporary in nature and impact the value of the risa 
such other than temporary differences are immediately recognized in income as a component of retained interest income or expense 
there were no restrictions on the risa

table of contents the balance of contracts days or more delinquent included in such securitization trusts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
net chargeoffs for these securitization trusts totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
asset quality overview nonperforming assets  repossessions  loan delinquency and credit losses are considered by us as key measures of asset quality 
asset quality  in turn  affects our determination of the allowance for credit losses 
we also take into consideration general economic conditions in the markets we serve  individual loan reviews  and the level of assets relative to reserves in determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
see business underwriting and purchasing of contracts  servicing of contracts 
automobile contract quality we provide financing in a market where there is a risk of default by borrowers 
chargeoffs directly impact our earnings and cash flows 
to minimize the amount of credit losses we incur  we monitor delinquent accounts  promptly repossess and remarket vehicles  and seek to collect on deficiency balances

allowance for credit losses our allowance for credit losses was million at december  compared with million at december  we have increased our percentage of allowance for credit losses from at december  to at december  as we have experienced higher losses in our owned contract portfolio due to a slowing economy 
we reduced our reserves for multifamily loans due to a decline in the portfolio  fewer foreclosures and higher real estate values 
based on the analysis we performed related to the allowance for credit losses as described under critical accounting policies  we believe that our allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to cover probable losses in our loan portfolio that can be reasonable estimated

table of contents capital resources and liquidity overview we require substantial capital resources and cash to support our business 
our ability to maintain positive cash flows from operations is the result of our consistent managed growth  our ability to manage risk adjusted returns and our efficient operations 
in addition to our indirect statement of cash flows as presented under gaap  we also analyze the key cash flows from our automobile lending operations on a direct basis excluding certain items such as the purchase or securitizations of loans

principal sources of cash we employ various sources to fund our operations  including collections of principal and interest from loans  deposits  securitizations  commercial paper  advances from the fhlb  repurchase agreements  subordinated debentures and other borrowings 
the sources used vary depending on such factors as rates paid  maturities  and the impact on capital 
collections of principal and interest from loans our primary source of funds is the collection of principal and interest from contracts originated and securitized  to the extent that the transaction is an on balance sheet transaction 
these monies are deposited into collection accounts established in connection with each securitization  or into our accounts for non securitized contracts 
pursuant to reinvestment contracts entered into in connection with most securitizations  we receive access to the amounts deposited into collection accounts and amounts held in the spread accounts 
we use those amounts so received in our daily operations to fund the purchase of contracts or to cover the day to day costs of operations 
if delinquency or chargeoff rates in a securitization exceed established triggers  amounts required to be held in spread accounts will increase  requiring additional pledged collateral 
we may bear additional expense due to an increase in required collateral 
if the reinvestment contracts were no longer deemed an eligible investment  which determination would be made by the rating agencies or fsa  we would no longer have the ability to use this cash in the ordinary course of business and would need to obtain alternative financing  which may only be available on less attractive terms 
see business transactions with related parties reinvestment contracts 
if we were unable to obtain additional financing  we may have to curtail our contract purchasing activities  which would also have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
also  a significant increase in credit losses could have a material adverse impact on our collections of principal and interest from contracts 

table of contents for real estate loans and mbs  principal and interest are deposited into our own accounts and such amounts are also used in our daily operations 
total loan and mbs principal and interest collections totaled billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in principal and interest collections is due to an increase in the amount of contracts managed and mbs held by us 
deposits we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public  commercial enterprises and institutions by offering a variety of accounts and rates 
we offer regular passbook accounts  demand deposit accounts  money market accounts  certificate of deposit accounts and individual retirement accounts

generally  as other financial institutions  we have become more subject to short term fluctuations in deposit flows as customers have become more interest rate conscious 
our ability to attract and maintain deposits and control our cost of funds has been  and will continue to be  significantly affected by market conditions

these transactions generate cash proceeds that allow us to repay amounts borrowed and to purchase additional contracts 
since  we have securitized over billion of automobile receivables in public offerings  making us the fourth largest issuer of such securities in the nation 
changes in our asset backed securities program could materially adversely affect our earnings or ability to purchase and resell contracts on a timely basis 
such changes could include a delay in the completion of a planned securitization  negative market perception of us  or failure of the contracts we intend to securitize to conform to insurance company and rating agency requirements 
if we are unable to effectively securitize our contracts  we may have to reduce or even curtail our contract purchasing activities  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
borrowings and other sources of funds our other sources of funds include commercial paper  advances from the fhlb  sales of securities under agreements to repurchase  other borrowings and cash generated from operations 
we select from among these funding alternatives based on the timing and duration of our cash needs  as well as the costs  maturities and other requirements of each funding source 
the fhlb system functions in a reserve capacity for savings institutions 
as a member  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and are authorized to apply for advances from the fhlb on security of such stock and on certain residential mortgage loans

such borrowings may be made pursuant to several different programs offered from time to time by the fhlb 
additional funds are available subject to additional collateral and other requirements 
each credit program has its own interest rate  which may be fixed or variable  and range of maturities 
the fhlb prescribes the acceptable uses to which advances pursuant to each program may be put  as well as limitations on the sizes of advances and repayment provisions

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the credit and pricing committee is responsible for setting credit and pricing policies and for monitoring credit quality 
our asset liability committee is responsible for the management of interest rate and prepayment risks 
asset liability management is the process of measuring and controlling interest rate risk through matching the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets with those of interest bearing liabilities 
the asset liability committee closely monitors interest rate and prepayment risks and recommends policies for managing such risks 
the primary measurement tool for evaluating this risk is the use of interest rate shock analysis 
this analysis simulates the effects of an instantaneous and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points on our assets and liabilities and measures the resulting increase or decrease to our net portfolio value  also known as npv 
npv is the discounted value of the future cash flows or paths of cash flows in the presence of options based on volatility assumptions and an arbitrage free monte carlo simulation method to achieve the current market price of all assets minus all liabilities whose value is affected by interest rates changes plus the book value of non interest rate sensitive assets minus the book value of non interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the npv ratio is the ratio of the npv to the market value of our assets as calculated above 
in general  an increase in interest rates would more adversely affect our npv than would a decrease in interest rates 
the following table summarizes our npv sensitivity analysis at december  based on guidance from the ots changes in interest rates npv ratio basis points base case basis points another important measurement of our interest rate risk is gap analysis 
gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest sensitive assets that reprice versus the amount of interest sensitive liabilities that also reprice within a defined period of time 
we have more interest sensitive liabilities rather than assets repricing in shorter term maturity buckets and more interest sensitive assets rather than liabilities repricing in longer term maturity buckets 

table of contents the following table summarizes our maturity gap position interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  within months to year to years to after months year years years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets investment securities other investments mortgage backed securities total investments consumer loans mortgage loans adjustable rate fixed rate construction loans commercial loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities deposits passbook accounts demand deposit and money market accounts certificate accounts fhlb advances securities sold under agreements to repurchase notes payable on automobile secured financing subordinated debentures other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities excess interest earning bearing assets liabilities effect of hedging activities hedged excess deficit cumulative excess cumulative difference as a percentage of total interest earning assets based on contractual maturities adjusted by our historical prepayment rate 
based on interest rate repricing adjusted for projected prepayments 
based on historical retention rate 
based on contractual maturity 
includes effect of interest rate swaps designated against deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
the contracts originated and held by us are fixed rate and  accordingly  we have exposure to changes in interest rates 
to protect against potential changes in interest rates affecting interest payments on future securitizations  we enter into various hedge agreements 
we enter into euro dollar futures contracts and 
table of contents forward swap agreements in order to hedge our future interest payments on our notes payable on automobile secured financing 
the market value of these hedge agreements responds inversely to changes in interest rates 
because of this inverse relationship  we can effectively lock in a gross interest rate spread at the time of entering into the hedge transaction 
gains and losses on these agreements are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
any ineffective portion is recognized in interest expense during that period if the hedge is greater than effective 
upon completion of the securitization  the gains or losses are recognized in full as an adjustment to the gain or loss on the sale of the contracts if the securitization is treated as a sale or amortized on a level yield basis over the duration of the notes issued if the securitization is treated as a secured financing 
these hedge instruments are settled daily  and therefore  there are no related financial instruments on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
credit risk related to these hedge instruments is minimal 
as we issued certain variable rate notes payable in and  we also entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge our variable interest rate exposure on future interest payments 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is included in notes payable on automobile secured financing  and any change in the fair value is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
any ineffective portion is recorded in interest expense during that period if the hedge is greater than effective 
related interest income or expense is settled on a quarterly basis and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
we also enter into interest rate swap agreements or other derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
or that we choose not to designate as hedges 
these derivatives pertain to variable rate notes issued in conjunction with the securitization of our contracts 
any change in the market value of such derivatives is recorded to income each month 
any income or expense recognized on such derivatives is recognized as miscellaneous income or expense 
we have entered into or committed to interest rate swaps as hedges against deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to manage interest rate risk exposure 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is included in deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  respectively and any change in the fair value is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
related interest income or expense is settled on a quarterly basis and is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the period during which cash flows on the hedged items affect income 
the asset liability committee monitors our hedging activities to ensure that the value of hedges  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
the amount and timing of hedging transactions are determined by our senior management based upon the monitoring activities of the asset liability committee 
as a result of our approach to interest rate risk management and our hedging strategies  we do not anticipate that changes in interest rates will materially affect our results of operations or liquidity  although we can provide no assurance in this regard 
there were no material changes in market risks in the current year compared with the prior year 
the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments used that are sensitive to changes in interest rates
