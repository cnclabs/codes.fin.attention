this commentary should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and eleven year financial summary  which are also presented in this form k 
certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the presentation 
these reclassifications had no impact on reported prior year total revenues  operating profit or net income 
forward looking statements this discussion including  in particular  the discussion under outlook  the information contained in the subsequent notes to the consolidated financial statements and the information contained in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  contain certain forward looking statements that are based largely on the company s current expectations 
forward looking statements are subject to certain risks  trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results and achievements to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
such risks  trends and uncertainties  which in some instances are beyond the company s control  include changes in advertising demand  newsprint prices  cost of broadcast rights  interest rates  competition and other economic conditions  regulatory and judicial rulings  adverse results from litigation or tax related proceedings or audits  the effect of professional sports team labor strikes  lock outs and negotiations  the effect of acquisitions  investments  divestitures  derivative transactions and litigation on the company s results of operations and financial condition  and the company s reliance on third party vendors for various services 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  could  should  intend and similar expressions generally identify forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements  which are being made as of the date of this filing 
the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant policies are summarized in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item these policies conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and reflect practices appropriate to the company s businesses 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to income taxes  pension and postretirement benefits  broadcast rights  goodwill and other intangible assets  self insurance liabilities and accounts receivable allowances 
income taxes the company accounts for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting purposes than for income tax reporting purposes 
the company records its tax liabilities based on estimates of the amount of taxes that will ultimately be paid 
since the company s tax returns are subject to audit by the internal revenue service irs and various states  tax liabilities are maintained for potential federal and state audit adjustments 
during  times mirror  which was acquired by tribune in  disposed of its matthew bender and mosby subsidiaries in separate tax free reorganizations 
while the company strongly believes that these transactions were completed on a tax free basis  the irs has audited the transactions and disagreed with the position taken by times mirror 
in  the company received an irs adjustment to increase times mirror s taxable income by approximately billion 
if the irs prevails  the company s federal and state income tax liability would be approximately million  plus interest 
as of dec 
  the interest on the proposed taxes would be approximately million 
the company intends to vigorously defend its position and filed a petition in us tax court on nov 
 to contest the irs position 
a tax reserve of million  plus million of interest  relating to these transactions is included in other obligations on the consolidated balance sheets 
the irs had originally proposed tax penalties of with respect to these transactions 
however  during the third quarter of  the irs notified the company that its previously proposed penalty would not be asserted 
in  the company reduced its income tax liabilities by a total of million as a result of favorably resolving certain federal and state income tax issues 
this adjustment was recorded as a reduction of income tax expense 
the resolutions of the company s tax issues are unpredictable and could result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than that which has been provided by the company 
pension and postretirement benefits the company provides defined benefit pension  postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees under a variety of plans see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item 
accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires the use of several assumptions 
weighted average assumptions used each year in accounting for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits were pension benefits other postretirement benefits discount rate for expense discount rate for obligations increase in future salary levels for expense increase in future salary levels for obligations long term rate of return on plans assets in  the company expects to lower its long term rate of return assumption to 
the reduction in the rate of return reflects the recent returns in the overall equity market 
the company s pension assets of billion at dec 
 are invested approximately in equity investments and in fixed income securities 
a decrease in the company s long term rate of return assumption results in an million decrease in the net pension credit 
at dec 
  the company s prepaid pension asset included an unrecognized net actuarial loss of million 
a significant portion of this net actuarial loss resulted from the difference between the company s expected returns on plan assets and the actual losses on plan assets in and expected returns on plan assets were million and million in and  respectively  actual losses were million and million  respectively 
in accordance with fas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the actuarial loss will be recognized in the net periodic pension credit over the estimated average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
the company s policy is to incorporate asset related gains and losses into the asset value used to calculate the expected return on plan assets and into the calculation of amortization of unrecognized net actuarial loss over a four year period 
as a result of all these factors  the company s net pension credit before the voluntary retirement program vrp related charge in is expected to decline by approximately million in for purposes of measuring postretirement health care costs  a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the rate was assumed to decrease to for and remain at that level thereafter 
for purposes of measuring health care obligations at dec 
  a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to for and remain at that level thereafter 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans 
a change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects in thousands increase decrease service cost and interest cost   benefit obligation   broadcast rights broadcast rights consist principally of rights to broadcast syndicated programs  sports and feature films and are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
the total cost of these rights is recorded as an asset and a liability when the program becomes available for broadcast 
syndicated program rights that have limited showings are generally amortized using an accelerated method as programs are aired 
sports and feature films rights are amortized using the straight line method 
at dec 
  the company had a net broadcast rights asset of million 
the company maintains an allowance for programming that is not expected to be aired by the end of the contract period 
this allowance for excess inventory is based on a program by program review of the company s five year broadcast plans and historical write off trends 
the total reserve balance at dec 
 was million 
actual write offs in were million 
future write offs can vary based on changes in consumer viewing trends and the availability and costs of other programming 
goodwill and other intangible assets on dec 
  the first day of the company s fiscal year  the company adopted fas  which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets no longer be amortized to earnings  but be reviewed periodically for impairment 
the provisions of fas that pertain to impairment of intangible assets have superceded the impairment related provisions included in fas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  beginning in fiscal year under fas  the impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not being amortized must be based generally on fair values  the review under fas was based generally on projected future undiscounted cash flows 
the estimated fair values of these assets subject to the impairment review were calculated as of dec 
 and dec 
 based on projected future discounted cash flow analyses 
as a result of initially applying the new impairment provisions of fas  the company recorded a pretax charge of million million after tax  or 
per diluted share in the first quarter of the charge related to certain of the company s newspaper mastheads million  a federal communications commission fcc license million and a television network affiliation agreement million  and is presented as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statements of income 
the impairments were primarily the result of decreases in operating revenues compared to forecasts prepared at the dates the respective companies were acquired 
the company s goodwill and other intangible assets at dec 
 consisted of the following in thousands gross amount accumulated amortization net amount intangible assets continuing to be amortized subscribers useful life of to years   other useful life of to years    total    goodwill and other intangibles no longer being amortized goodwill publishing  broadcasting and entertainment  interactive  total goodwill  newspaper mastheads  fcc licenses  network affiliation agreements  tradename  total  total goodwill and other intangible assets  the company will perform an impairment review of goodwill and certain intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year 
in the fourth quarter of  the impairment review resulted in no further impairment charges 
however  since the estimated fair values of these assets used in the impairment calculation are subject to change based on the company s results and overall market conditions  future impairment charges are possible 
self insurance liabilities the company self insures for certain employee medical and disability benefits  workers compensation costs and automobile and general liability claims 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks are calculated using actuarial methods and are not discounted 
the liabilities include amounts for actual claims  claim growth and claims incurred but not recorded 
actual experience  including claim frequency and severity as well as health care inflation  could result in different liabilities than the amounts currently recorded 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks totaled million and million at dec 
 and dec 
  respectively 
accounts receivable allowances the company s accounts receivable are primarily due from advertisers 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of a customer s financial condition 
the company maintains an allowance for uncollectable accounts  rebates and volume discounts 
at dec 
  the company s allowance for accounts receivable was million 
during  the company incurred million of bad debt write offs and million of rebates and volume discounts
