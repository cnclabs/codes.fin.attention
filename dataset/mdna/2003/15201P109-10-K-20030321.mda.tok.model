all historical financial presentations have been restated to reflect the merger 
the outstanding shares of the three banks were converted into company common stock at agreed upon exchange ratios described in the merger agreements 
in the transaction  the shareholders of the three banks became shareholders of the company  which owns all of the outstanding shares of the three banks 
the three banks maintain their separate identities as wholly owned subsidiaries of the company 
during  the company formed a majority owned subsidiary c 
s

the shareholders of csb received shares of company common stock and in cash for each share of csb stock 
csb will maintain its separate identity  and operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  similar to the company s other three subsidiary banks 
csb is a commercial bank with operations in eastern polk county  florida 
csb was capitalized by selling  shares of stock to approximately local individuals at per share million initial capital 
csb began operations on april  in winter haven  florida  in a rented location 
subsequently  it purchased land and built a  square foot  two story  brick building  which it now occupies as its main office 
most of the second floor has been leased to an unrelated party 
in september  it opened its first branch office in auburndale  florida  and a second branch office was opened in january in lakeland  florida

pinner is also the president and ceo of the company 
the chairman of csb james h 
white is also the chairman of the company 

table of contents during and  the company converted each subsidiary bank to the same core data processing service bureau 
in addition  each bank was required to convert to a standardized chart of accounts and general ledger 
this standardization allows for improved efficiency and control in the reporting process 
the last bank converted during april the company opened new branch banking offices in lake alfred  florida during september  in spring hill  florida during october  and in inverness  florida during october the company now has twenty one full service locations  one remote drive through facility and the item processing center discussed above 
there are approximately full time equivalent employees 
the company s principal asset is its ownership of the banks 
accordingly  the company s results of operations are primarily dependent upon the results of operations of the banks 
the company conducts commercial banking business consisting of attracting deposits from the general public and applying those funds to the origination of commercial  consumer and real estate loans including commercial loans collateralized by real estate 
the company s profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from interest earning assets ie loans and investments less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities ie customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned and paid on these balances 
net interest income is dependent upon the company s interest rate spread which is the difference between the average yield earned on its interest earning assets and the average rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows  and loan demand 
additionally  and to a lesser extent  the company s profitability is affected by such factors as the level of non interest income and expenses  the provision for credit losses  and the effective tax rate 
non interest income consists primarily of service fees on deposit accounts 
non interest expense consists of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  and other operating expenses 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors reviews and evaluation of individual loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry groups  historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 

table of contents loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
deferred tax assets we use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced 
our deferred tax assets are described further in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

the increase in non interest income was a result of an increase in deposit related and other miscellaneous fees  both due to the overall growth of the loan and deposit portfolios 
the increase in non interest expense was due to increases in employee and equipment related expenses resulting from new branches opened in september and two in october and a new item processing center that opened in july  as well as the overall growth of the loan and deposit portfolios

provision for loan losses the provision for loan loss losses increased  or to  during the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  management s policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to current period earnings  and is decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries on prior loan charge offs 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers those levels maintained by conditions of individual borrowers  the historical loan loss experience  the general economic environment and the overall portfolio composition 
as these factors change  the level of loan loss provision changes 
see asset quality regarding the allowance for loan losses for additional information 
non interest income non interest income for increased by  or  to  as compared to  for the year ending december  the net increase was partly comprised of a  increase in service charges on deposit accounts 
the remaining  net increase was primarily the result of increases in other service charges and fees  including commissions earned on originating single family mortgage loans for others  and commissions earned on the sale of mutual funds and annuity products

the allowance consists of amounts established for specific loans and is also based on historical loan loss experience 
the specific reserve element is the result of a regular analysis of all loans and commitments based on credit rating classifications 
the historical loan loss element represents an assessment of potential credit problems and is determined using loan loss experience of each loan type

in addition to interest rate sensitive deposits  the primary demand for liquidity is anticipated fundings under credit commitments to customers 
the company does not use off balance sheet financing 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the rate sensitive position  or gap  is the difference in the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities  at a given time interval  including both floating rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity 
the measurement of the company s interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the principal techniques used in asset liability management 
management 
table of contents generally attempts to maintain a range  set by policy  between rate sensitive assets and liabilities by repricing periods 
each bank sets its own range  approved by their board of directors 
generally  the range is between and 
if the bank falls outside their pre approved range  it requires board action and board approval 
the asset mix of the balance sheet is evaluated continually in terms of several variables yield  credit quality  and appropriate funding sources and liquidity 
management of the liability mix of the balance sheet focuses on expanding the various funding sources 
the company s gap and liquidity positions are reviewed periodically by management to determine whether or not changes in policies and procedures are necessary to achieve financial goals

in the rate sensitivity analysis table  rate sensitive assets and liabilities are shown by maturity or repricing periods  separating fixed and variable interest rates 
the estimated fair value of each instrument category is also shown in the table 
while these estimates of fair value are based on management s judgment of the most appropriate factors  there is no assurance that  if the company had to dispose of such instruments at december   the estimated fair values would necessarily have been achieved at that date  since market values may differ depending on various circumstances 
the estimated fair values at december   should not necessarily be considered to apply at subsequent dates

the bank regulatory agencies have established risk based capital requirements for banks 
these guidelines are intended to provide an additional measure of a bank s capital adequacy by assigning weighted levels of risk to asset categories 
banks are also required to systematically maintain capital against such off balance sheet activities as loans sold with recourse  loan commitments  guarantees and standby letters of credit 
these guidelines are intended to strengthen the quality of capital by increasing the emphasis on common equity and restricting the amount of loan loss reserves and other forms of equity such as preferred stock that may be included in capital 
each of the company s subsidiary banks objective is to maintain its current status as a well capitalized institution as that term is defined by its regulators 
under the terms of the guidelines  banks must meet minimum capital adequacy based upon both total assets and risk adjusted assets 
all banks are required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of 
adherence to these guidelines has not had an adverse impact on the company

table of contents effects of inflation and changing prices the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
in addition  inflation affects financial institutions increased cost of goods and services purchased  the cost of salaries and benefits  occupancy expense  and similar items 
inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity  earnings  and shareholders equity 
commercial and other loan originations and refinancings tend to slow as interest rates increase  and can reduce the company s earnings from such activities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of economic loss from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in a interest rates  b foreign exchange rates  or c other factors that relate to market volatility of the rate  index  or price underlying the financial instrument 
the company s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
each subsidiary bank of the company has an asset liability committee alco which is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position  and establishing policies to monitor and limit the exposure to interest rate risk for their specific bank 
since nearly the company s entire interest rate risk exposure relates to the financial instrument activity of each subsidiary bank  the board of directors of each subsidiary bank reviews and approves the policies and guidelines established by their bank s alco 
the primary objective of asset liability management is to provide an optimum and stable net interest margin  after tax return on assets and return on equity capital  as well as adequate liquidity and capital 
interest rate risk is measured and monitored through gap analysis  which measures the amount of repricing risk associated with the balance sheet at specific points in time
