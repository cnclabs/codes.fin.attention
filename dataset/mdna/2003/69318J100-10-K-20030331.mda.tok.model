our business to business marketing efforts include smbs  government and educational organizations and medium to large corporate accounts 
as of december   we employed account managers  including new account managers with less than months of outbound telemarketing experience with us 
account managers are responsible for managing corporate accounts and focus on outbound sales calls to prospective customers

for the fiscal year  internet sales processed directly online were million  or of net sales  compared to in  due largely to our acquisition of moredirect  inc in april these sales during the fourth quarter of were million  or of that quarter s net sales 
the internet supports three key business initiatives for us customer choice we have built our business on the premise that our customers should be able to choose how they interact with us  be it by mail  telephone  fax  e mail or over the web

the overall us information technology it market that we serve is estimated at billion 
our consolidated sales represents only approximately 
of the it market  providing us with ample growth opportunities 
the largest segment of the market is served by local value added resellers vars  many of whom are actively exiting the hardware and software business as margins have become too small 
we are transitioning from an end user or desktop centric computing supplier to a network or enterprise wide computing supplier  as well as partnered with third party technology and telecommunications service providers 
we now offer access to the same services and technical expertise to our customers as local vars  but with more extensive product selection at lower prices and are  therefore  well positioned to increase our market share 
intense competition for customers has led manufacturers of pcs and related products to use all available channels  including direct marketers  to distribute products 
although certain manufacturers who have traditionally used resellers to distribute their products have established or attempted to establish their own direct marketing operations  including sales through the internet  to our knowledge  only one has replaced its traditional indirect selling channels as the principal means of distribution 
accordingly  we believe that these manufacturers will continue to provide us and other third party direct marketers favorable product allocations and marketing support 
we believe new entrants to the direct marketing channel must overcome a number of obstacles  including the substantial time and resources required to build a customer base of meaningful size  quality and responsiveness for cost effective circulation  the high costs of developing the information and operating infrastructure required by direct marketers  the advantages enjoyed by larger and more established competitors in terms of purchasing and operating efficiencies  the difficulty of building relationships with manufacturers to achieve favorable product allocations and attractive pricing terms  and the difficulty of identifying and recruiting management personnel with significant direct marketing experience in the industry

table of contents process  infringed on microsoft s trademarks and copyrights 
while we never counterfeited microsoft products  nor knowingly resold counterfeit microsoft products  we believe that it was in our best interest to settle the dispute rather than to litigate 
while denying the allegations  we agreed to pay microsoft  to settle the case 
the settlement costs and related legal fees of approximately  is included as a special charge in our first quarter financial results 
we also agreed in the settlement to acquire microsoft products only through distributors identified as authorized by microsoft  codifying a policy that we have had in place since early on march   the lemelson medical  education research foundation  lp filed a complaint in federal district court in the state of arizona naming us as an additional defendant in the so called federal express case 
the federal express case involves approximately eighty eight defendants and pertains to claims made by the foundation relating to its right to royalties for the use of bar code scanners that allegedly utilize technology covered by patents now owned by the foundation 
the foundation has previously filed claims against manufacturers of bar code scanners and has now also filed claims against users of bar code scanners  including pc connection 
the manufacturers of bar code scanners and the foundation are currently engaged in litigation in nevada federal district court relating to the validity of the patents at issue 
the defendants in the arizona litigation have requested the federal district court to stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the nevada litigation  which the court granted 
until the nevada patent litigation is resolved  we will expend little  if any  legal fees in the arizona case 
if the bar code manufacturers are successful in the nevada case  we expect the arizona court to dismiss the action against us 
the foundation has not specified the amount of damages it seeks in its complaint  but such damages may be material 
if the foundation ultimately prevails in the arizona litigation  the damages assessed against us may be material and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in addition  we may be required to modify the methods by which we track inventories and ship products which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we intend to vigorously defend this claim and  to the extent we are found liable  we believe we have indemnification claims against certain manufacturers of bar code scanners 
while we may ultimately decide to seek indemnity from certain manufacturers of bar code scanners  we can provide no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining such indemnity 
at a minimum  if the nevada or arizona litigation proceeds  we may incur material legal fees in the defense of the foundation s claims or in seeking indemnity from certain manufacturers of bar code scanners

application of significant accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements of pc connection are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized at the point in time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain oral or written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified 
table of contents amount of product at a specified price 
because we either i have a general practice of covering customer losses while products are in transit despite title transferring to the customer at the point of shipment or ii have fob destination specifically set out in our arrangements with federal agencies  delivery is deemed to have occurred at the point in time when the product is received by the customer 
we provide our customers with a limited thirty day right of return generally limited to defective merchandise 
revenue is recognized at delivery and a reserve for sales returns is recorded 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  based on significant historical experience 
should such returns no longer prove estimable  we believe that the impact on our financials would not necessarily be significant since the return privilege expires days after shipment 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and customers current credit worthiness 
our allowance is generally computed by applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due  and specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of certain of our customers were to deteriorate  or if we noted there was a lengthening of the timing of the settlement of receivables that was symptomatic of a general deterioration in the ability of our customers to pay  we would have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would negatively impact our earnings and our cash flows 
in addition to accounts receivable from customers  we record receivables from our vendors suppliers for cooperative advertising  price protection  supplier reimbursements  rebates and other similar arrangements 
a portion of such receivables is estimated based on information available from our vendors at discrete points in time 
while such estimates have historically approximated actual cash received  an unanticipated change in a promotional program could give rise to a reduction in the receivable 
this could negatively impact our earnings and our cash flows 
considerable judgment is used in assessing the ultimate realization of customer receivables and vendor supplier receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of a customer  vendor information and gauging current market conditions 
if our evaluations are incorrect  we may incur future charges to our income statement 
inventories merchandise inventories all finished goods consisting of software packages  computer systems and peripheral equipment are stated at cost determined under the first in  first out method or market  whichever is lower 
inventory quantities on hand are reviewed regularly  and provisions are made for obsolete  slow moving and nonsalable inventory  based primarily on management s forecast of customer demand for those products in inventory 
the pc industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product development that could result in increased obsolescence of inventory on hand 
increased obsolescence or decreased customer demand beyond management s expectations could require additional provisions 
this could negatively impact our earnings and our cash flows 
our obsolescence charges have historically approximated million per annum 
there have been no unusual charges precipitated by specific technological or forecast issues 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles we carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet 
these are all currently classified as held for use 
these include property and equipment  identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
an impairment review is undertaken on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  and on an event driven basis for all long lived assets including indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from such assets may be diminished 
we may review the carrying value of all these assets based partly on our projections of anticipated cash flows projections which 
table of contents are  in part  dependent upon anticipated market conditions  operational performance and legal status 
any impairment charge that is recorded negatively impacts our earnings 
cash flows are generally not impacted 
over the last several years  we have incurred no significant impairment charges 
while we believe that our future estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could materially effect our valuations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
employee compensation benefits our employee compensation model has several elements that we would consider variable 
these include our obligation to our employees for health care 
we have selected a plan that results in our being self insured up to certain stop loss limits 
accordingly  we have to estimate the amount of health care claims outstanding at a given point in time 
these estimates are based on historical experience and could be subject to change 
such change could negatively impact both our earnings and our cash flows 
we also provide stock option grants to our employees 
in general  such grants have been made at the current fair value of our stock and accordingly  given that we account for option awards under apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  no compensation charge has been recorded 
in previous years  most specifically those years prior to our initial public offering  there was a difference between the strike price of the option and the then current fair value of the stock 
this difference resulted in a fixed and determinable compensation charge 
we have not modified option grants in a manner that would cause either re measurement of the awards or the commencement of variable accounting 
we have also engaged in workforce reduction actions in and these actions included formula driven termination benefits 
these benefits were or are being paid relatively quickly and have not been subject to change 
we do not foresee a circumstance where there could be significant variability in our workforce reduction estimates 
however  if we did experience significant variability  such change could negatively impact our cash flows 
overview pc connection was founded in as a mail order business offering a broad range of software and accessories for ibm and ibm compatible personal computers 
the founders goal was to provide consumers with superior service and high quality branded products at competitive prices 
currently  we offer a wide range of information technology products and services including computer systems  software and peripheral equipment  networking communications and other products and accessories 
we operate through three primary business segments a consumers and small to medium size businesses through our pc connection sales subsidiary  b federal  state and local government and educational institutions through our govconnection subsidiary and c in  large corporate accounts through our newly acquired subsidiary  moredirect  inc we generate sales through i outbound telemarketing and field sales by account managers focused on the business  education and government markets  ii inbound calls from customers responding to our catalogs and other advertising and iii our internet web sites 
sales of computer systems result in a relatively high dollar sales order  as reflected in the increase in our average order size from in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  computer systems generally provide the largest gross profit dollar contribution per order of all our products  although they usually yield the lowest gross margin percentage 
the weakness in demand for information technology products experienced by us in  however  continued through  resulting in overall conservative buying patterns  order deferrals and longer sales cycles  as well as greater competition and slightly lower profit margins 
our profit margins are also influenced by  among other things  industry pricing and the relative mix of smb versus public sector and large corporate account sales  and within the smb segment  inbound versus outbound 
table of contents sales 
generally  pricing in the computer and related products market is very aggressive  and we intend to maintain prices at competitive levels 
the gross margin on sales to corporate accounts that purchase at volume discounts is generally lower than gross margins on consumer or smaller business sales 
however  the gross profit dollar contribution per order is generally higher as average order sizes of orders to such corporate accounts are usually larger 
we believe that sales to larger businesses will continue to represent a growing portion of our business mix in future periods 
the direct marketing of personal computers and related products is highly competitive 
in addition to other direct marketers and manufacturers who sell direct  such as dell and gateway  manufacturers of pcs sold by us  such as apple  hewlett packard and ibm  have also implemented varying plans to sell pcs directly to end users 
we currently believe that direct sales by hewlett packard and ibm will not have a significant adverse effect upon our net sales 
most product manufacturers provide us with co op advertising support in exchange for product coverage in our catalogs 
although the level of co op advertising support available to us from certain manufacturers has declined  and may decline further in the future  the overall level of co op advertising programs has remained consistent with our levels of spending for catalog and other advertising programs 
we believe that the overall levels of co op advertising programs available over the next twelve months will be consistent with our planned advertising programs 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated information derived from our statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december  net sales in millions net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring costs and other special charges income from operations

year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased marginally to  million in from  million in the increase was due primarily to our acquisition of moredirect  inc moredirect in early april  which accounted for million of our sales 
absent that acquisition  net sales would have decreased by million  due to the continuing weakness in demand for information technology products  especially with our small and medium size business customers 
net changes in sales by business segment were as follows net sales for our smb segment decreased by million  or  to million in from million in our sales to consumers and small businesses  which make up a large portion of this segment  were negatively impacted during the continuing economic slowdown 
we believe that sales to consumers and small businesses will continue to be more heavily impacted than sales to larger business customers if the economic slowdown continues 
net sales for our public sector segment remained relatively flat at million in  as compared to million in the increased level of our sales to federal government agencies in the fourth quarter of after the september th disaster extended into the first quarter of

inbound sales  which primarily serve our consumer and very small business customers in our smb segment  decreased million  or  to million from million in for the reasons stated above 
online internet sales increased million  or  to million from million in  due primarily to the acquisition of moredirect  which accounted for million of the increase 
excluding moredirect  the increase in our online internet sales was million  or  as more of our corporate and public sector customers migrated to placing orders online through our internet website 
we believe that the inbound sales channel will continue to produce a declining percentage of our total sales as we migrate to larger business and public sector customers 
we also expect the migration of customers to our website to continue  which will increase the percentage of online internet sales 
net sales of enterprise server and networking products increased to million in as compared to million in enterprise server and networking products represented of overall net sales for the year  up from for the year ended moredirect sales of enterprise products  however  accounted for million of our sales  excluding moredirect  our sales of these products decreased by  comparable to the overall decrease in sales explained above 
we believe that sales of these product categories will grow as a percentage of our net sales  as customers further upgrade their network and communication infrastructures 
however  if economic conditions do not improve in the near term  the sales growth of these types of products will not likely grow as we anticipate 
as of december   the number of outbound sales account managers totaled  compared to account managers at the end of the total includes moredirect account managers 
excluding moredirect  our outbound sales account managers decreased by 
the decrease is the result of staff reductions relating to our ongoing evaluation of sales productivity

gross profit decreased million to million in from million in moredirect accounted for million of our gross margin  excluding moredirect  the decrease in gross margin was million  or 
the decrease in gross profit dollars was attributable to the changes in net sales described above  together with a decrease in gross profit margin 
gross profit margin decreased from in to in due to a more competitive pricing environment and other market conditions 
our gross profit margins are influenced by  among other things  industry pricing  customer segment and relative product mix 
generally pricing in the computer and related products market is very aggressive  and we intend to maintain prices at competitive levels 
sales to our smb customers generally carry higher gross margins than our sales to large accounts or public sector customers 
additionally  sales of enterprise server and networking products generally carry higher gross margins than sales of desktops and notebook computers 
our gross margin may vary based upon vendor support programs  product mix  pricing strategies  market conditions and other factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in from million in and increased as a percentage of sales to in from in moredirect s selling  general and administrative expenses accounted for million of the total  or of its sales 
personnel costs generally account for approximately two thirds of our selling  general and administrative sg a 
table of contents expenses 
sg a expense continues to increase as a percentage of sales because we have implemented additional sales growth initiatives and improved marketing programs 
while we plan to increase our focus on controlling discretionary expenditures  we expect that our sg a expense may vary depending on changes in sales volume  as well as the levels of continued investments in key growth initiatives such as hiring more experienced outbound sales account managers  improving marketing programs  and deploying next generation internet web technology to support the sales organization 
restructuring costs and other special charges totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

income from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in these decreases were attributable to the changes in net sales as discussed above 
interest expense of million was recorded in both and interest expense remained flat due to higher average borrowings outstanding offset by lower interest rates in as compared to our effective tax rate was for and for this year over year decrease was due to our recognition of a new hampshire business enterprise tax credit in the relative size of our tax provision   tends to magnify the beneficial impact of such credit on a percentage basis 
however  we anticipate that our effective tax rate will approximate a level in due to the expected changes and mix of state income taxes 
net income decreased by million  or  to million in from million in  principally as a result of the decrease in income from operations 
moredirect s net income was million in excluding moredirect  our operations incurred a net loss of million

if economic conditions do not improve in the near term  the anticipated growth of these types of products will not likely occur as expected 
as of december   the number of outbound sales account managers totaled  a decrease  compared to account managers at the end of the decrease is primarily the result of staff reductions relating to our continuing evaluation of sales productivity  particularly in our smb segment

million  or  to million in from million in this decrease in interest expense was attributed to lower average borrowings outstanding in as compared to and to lower interest rates 
our effective tax rate was for both and net income decreased by million  or  to million in from million in  principally as a result of the decrease in income from operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and bank borrowings 
we believe that funds generated from operations  together with available credit under our bank line of credit  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least for the next twelve calendar months 
our ability to continue funding our planned growth  both internally and externally  is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  or from other sources of financing  as may be required 
while at this time  we do not anticipate needing any additional sources of financing to fund our operations  if demand for information technology products continues to decline  our cash flows from operations may be substantially affected 
see also those risks listed below under factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million provided by operating activities and million used for operating activities for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the primary factors historically affecting cash flows from operations are net income and changes in the levels of accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
at december   we had million in outstanding accounts payable 
such accounts are generally paid within days of incurrence and will be financed by cash flows from operations or short term borrowings 
table of contents under the line of credit 
this amount includes million payable to two financial institutions under security agreements to facilitate the purchase of inventory 
we believe we will be able to meet our obligations under our accounts payable with cash flows from operations and our existing line of credit 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect capital expenditures  primarily for the purchase of computer hardware and software and other fixed assets  to be approximately million for the year ending december  and anticipate funding these capital expenditures from cash flows from operations 
in may  we entered into a million credit facility secured by substantially all of our business assets 
in july  as required under the terms of the credit facility  an additional lender committed to fund million of the million facility 
had we not secured this additional lender  the credit facility would have been reduced to million in july 
amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at the prime rate at december  
the credit facility includes various customary financial and operating covenants  minimum net worth and maximum funded debt ratio requirements  including restrictions on the payment of dividends  none of which we believe significantly restricts our operations 
the maximum allowable funded debt ratio under the agreement is to  our actual funded debt ratio at december  was only to funded debt ratio is the ratio of average outstanding advances under the facility to ebitda earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
borrowing availability under the agreement is further limited to twice the amount of ebitda for the trailing four quarters  such availability was million at december  no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility at december  the credit facility matures on june   at which time amounts outstanding become due 
the merger agreement with moredirect contemplates an earn out period of three years following the closing whereby if moredirect maintains certain earnings before income tax  or ebit  levels  additional payments will be made to moredirect s shareholder 
under the merger agreement  earn out payments are tied to ebit levels targeted to grow at a rate per year 
the maximum payments we will make under the earn out provisions of the merger agreement are million  assuming moredirect maintains of targeted ebit levels for all three years 
if moredirect maintains less than of targeted ebit levels for all three years  no payment would be required under the earn out provisions of the merger agreement 
at any time during the earn out period  we may buy out the remaining earn out payments for amounts which vary during the term of the earn out 
we accrued a liability to moredirect s shareholder for million in earn out consideration for the year ended december  we also escrowed million at closing to fund a portion of these contingent payments  of which million will be used to satisfy a portion of the liability at december  we believe we will be able to meet our obligations to moredirect and its shareholder under the merger agreement

accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and replaces emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
it requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the restructuring activities undertaken by us prior to the issuance of this statement have been appropriately accounted for under eitf in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for the fiscal year ended december  we do not expect to change to the fair value based method  therefore  sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
have been adopted currently 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  which addresses the income statement characterization of consideration given by a vendor to a customer and provides guidance on recognizing and measuring sales incentives 
eitf issue no 
is effective for fiscal year we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting this guidance 

table of contents in november  the eitf reached a final consensus on issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor  which addresses how a reseller of a vendor s product should account for cash consideration received from a vendor 
the eitf issued guidance on the following two issues  as follows cash consideration received from a vendor should be recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in the reseller s income statement  unless the consideration is a reimbursement for selling costs or payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor  and performance driven vendor rebates or refunds eg  minimum purchase or sales volumes should be recognized as a reduction of cost of sales only if the payment is considered probable  and the method of allocating such payments in the financial statements should be systematic and rational based on the reseller s progress in achieving the underlying performance targets 
the provisions of eitf will be effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting this newly issued guidance 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  which requires that  for guarantees within the scope of fin issued or amended after december   a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee be recognized 
fin also requires additional disclosures in financial statements for periods ending after december  accordingly  these new disclosures are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
it is not expected that the recognition and measurement provisions of fin will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
inflation we have historically offset any inflation in operating costs by a combination of increased productivity and price increases  where appropriate 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our business in the future 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition our future results and financial condition are dependent on our ability to continue to successfully market  sell and distribute information technology products and services  including computers  hardware and software 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that we must successfully manage in order to achieve a favorable financial condition and favorable operating results 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our future financial condition and operating results include  without limitation  the following factors there has been a decrease in demand throughout the industry for the products we sell 
the general decline in the economy over the past two years  has resulted in a decrease in demand for personal computer products throughout the industry 
this decrease adversely affected our sales and results of operations in if our net sales do not increase in proportion to our operating expenses or if we experience a decrease in net sales for an extended period of time  there would be a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 
we have experienced rapid growth in recent years followed by a decline in sales in and  and there is no assurance that we will be able to regain such growth 
our net sales grew from million for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december  in the year ended december  and  our net sales declined to billion 
we believe we would have experienced a greater decline in our net sales for if it had not been for our acquisition of moredirect 
our growth in previous years placed increasing demands on our administrative  operational  financial and other resources 
our staffing levels and operating expenses increased substantially in recent years due to our sales forecasts 
if our revenues continue to decline  we may not be able to reduce our 
table of contents staffing levels and operating expenses in a timely manner to meet our needs 
moreover  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to regain rapid growth in the near future 
we may also experience quarterly fluctuations and seasonality which could impact our business 
several factors have caused our sales and results of operations to fluctuate and we expect these fluctuations to continue on a quarterly basis 
causes of these fluctuations include changes in the overall level of economic activity  changes in the level of business investment in information technology products  the condition of the personal computer industry in general  shifts in customer demand for hardware and software products  industry shipments of new products or upgrades  the timing of new merchandise and catalog offerings  fluctuations in response rates  fluctuations in postage  paper  shipping and printing costs and in merchandise returns  adverse weather conditions that affect response  distribution or shipping  shifts in the timing of holidays  changes in our product offerings  changes in consumer demand for information technology products  and changes in vendor distribution of products 
we base our operating expenditures on sales forecasts 
if revenues do not meet expectations in any given quarter  our operating results could suffer 
in addition  customer response rates for our catalogs and other marketing vehicles are subject to variations 
the first and last quarters of the year generally have higher response rates while the two middle quarters typically have lower response rates 
we are exposed to inventory obsolescence due to the rapid technological changes occurring in the personal computer industry 
the market for personal computer products is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements 
our success depends in large part on our ability to identify and market products that meet the needs of customers in that marketplace 
in order to satisfy customer demand and to obtain favorable purchasing discounts  we have and may continue to carry increased inventory levels of certain products 
by so doing  we are subject to the increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
also  in order to implement our business strategy  we intend to continue  among other things  to place larger than typical inventory stocking orders  and increase our participation in first to market purchase opportunities 
we may also participate in end of life cycle purchase opportunities and market products on a private label basis  which would increase the risk of inventory obsolescence 
in addition  we sometimes acquire special purchase products without return privileges 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid losses related to obsolete inventory 
in addition  manufacturers are limiting return rights and are also taking steps to reduce their inventory exposure by supporting build to order programs authorizing distributors and resellers to assemble computer hardware under the manufacturers brands 
these trends reduce the costs to manufacturers and shift the burden of inventory risk to resellers like us which could negatively impact our business 

table of contents we acquire products for resale from a limited number of vendors  the loss of any one of these vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly through distributors and other sources 
the five vendors supplying the greatest amount of goods to us constituted   and of our total product purchases in the years ended december    and  respectively 
among these five vendors  purchases from ingram micro  inc represented   and of our total product purchases in the years ended december    and  respectively 
purchases from tech data corporation comprised of our total product purchases in both the years ended december  and and in the year ended december  effective may   hewlett packard company hp completed its acquisition of compaq computer corporation 
had this acquisition been completed at the beginning of the periods presented  our purchases made directly from hp  on a pro forma basis  would have constituted   and of our total product purchases in the years ended december    and  respectively 
no other vendor supplied more than of our total product purchases in the years ended december    and if we were unable to acquire products from ingram  tech data or hp  we could experience a short term disruption in the availability of products and such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
substantially all of our contracts and arrangements with our vendors that supply significant quantities of products are terminable by such vendors or us without notice or upon short notice 
most of our product vendors provide us with trade credit  of which the net amount outstanding at december  was million 
termination  interruption or contraction of relationships with our vendors  including a reduction in the level of trade credit provided to us  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
some product manufacturers either do not permit us to sell the full line of their products or limit the number of product units available to direct marketers such as us 
an element of our business strategy is to continue to increase our participation in first to market purchase opportunities 
the availability of certain desired products  especially in the direct marketing channel  has been constrained in the past 
we could experience a material adverse effect to our business if we are unable to source first to market purchase or similar opportunities  or if we face the reemergence of significant availability constraints 
we may experience a reduction in the incentive programs offered to us by our vendors 
some product manufacturers and distributors provide us with incentives such as supplier reimbursements  payment discounts  price protection  rebates and other similar arrangements 
the increasingly competitive computer hardware market has already resulted in the following reduction or elimination of some of these incentive programs  more restrictive price protection and other terms  and reduced advertising allowances and incentives  in some cases 
many product suppliers provide us with co op advertising support and in exchange we feature their products in our catalogs 
this support significantly defrays our catalog production expense 
in the past  we have experienced a decrease in the level of co op advertising support available to us from certain manufacturers 
the level of co op advertising support we receive from some manufacturers may further decline in the future 
such a decline could increase our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and have a material adverse effect on our cash flows 
we face many competitive risks 
the direct marketing industry and the computer products retail business  in particular  are highly competitive 
we compete with consumer electronics and computer retail stores  including superstores 
we also 
table of contents compete with other direct marketers of hardware and software and computer related products  including an increasing number of internet retailers 
certain hardware and software vendors are selling their products directly through their own catalogs and over the internet 
we compete not only for customers  but also for co op advertising support from personal computer product manufacturers 
some of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and larger catalog circulations and customer bases and other resources than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors offer a wider range of products and services than we do and may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition  engage in more extensive promotional activities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than us 
we expect competition to increase as retailers and direct marketers who have not traditionally sold computers and related products enter the industry 
we cannot assure you that we can continue to compete effectively against our current or future competitors 
in addition  price is an important competitive factor in the personal computer hardware and software market and we cannot assure you that we will not face increased price competition 
if we encounter new competition or fail to compete effectively against our competitors  our business may be harmed 
in addition  product resellers and direct marketers are combining operations or acquiring or merging with other resellers and direct marketers to increase efficiency 
moreover  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 
we rely on key government contracts  the loss of which could harm our financial condition 
we are a party to several significant contracts with state and federal government agencies 
sales to state and federal government agencies represented of our net sales in we expect that our sales to state and federal government agencies will increase as a percentage of our consolidated revenues for the foreseeable future 
our current arrangements with these government agencies allow them to cancel orders with little or no notice and do not require them to purchase products from us in the future 
moreover  any and all orders relating to the federal government may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the federal government 
the loss of one or more of these significant contracts with state and federal government agencies could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we face and will continue to face significant price competition 
generally  pricing is very aggressive in the personal computer industry and we expect pricing pressures to continue 
an increase in price competition could result in a reduction of our profit margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  higher sales  cost reductions or otherwise 
also  our sales of personal computer hardware products are generally producing lower profit margins than those associated with software products 
such pricing pressures could result in an erosion of our market share  reduced sales and reduced operating margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the methods of distributing personal computers and related products are changing and such changes may negatively impact us and our business 
the manner in which personal computers and related products are distributed and sold is changing  and new methods of distribution and sale  such as online shopping services  have emerged 
hardware and software manufacturers have sold  and may intensify their efforts to sell  their products directly to end users 
from time to time  certain manufacturers have instituted programs for the direct sales of large order quantities of hardware and software to certain major corporate accounts 
these types of programs may continue to be developed and used by 
table of contents various manufacturers 
some of our vendors  including apple  hewlett packard and ibm  currently sell some of their products directly to end users and have stated their intentions to increase the level of such direct sales 
in addition  manufacturers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically to end users 
an increase in the volume of products sold through or used by consumers of any of these competitive programs or distributed electronically to end users could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we could experience system failures which would interfere with our ability to process orders 
we depend on the accuracy and proper use of our management information systems including our telephone system 
many of our key functions depend on the quality and effective utilization of the information generated by our management information systems  including our ability to manage inventory and accounts receivable collection  our ability to purchase  sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis  and our ability to maintain operations 
interruptions could result from natural disasters as well as power loss  telecommunications failure and similar events 
our management information systems require continual upgrades to most effectively manage our operations and customer database 
although we maintain some redundant systems  with full data backup  a substantial interruption in management information systems or in telephone communication systems would substantially hinder our ability to process customer orders and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we rely on the continued development of electronic commerce and internet infrastructure development 
we have had an increasing amount of sales made over the internet in part because of the growing use and acceptance of the internet by end users 
no one can be certain that acceptance and use of the internet will continue to develop or that a sufficiently broad base of consumers will adopt and continue to use the internet and other online services as a medium of commerce 
sales of computer products over the internet do not currently represent a significant portion of overall computer product sales 
growth of our internet sales is dependent on potential customers using the internet in addition to traditional means of commerce to purchase products 
we cannot accurately predict the rate at which they will do so 
our success in growing our internet business will depend in large part upon the development of an infrastructure for providing internet access and services 
if the number of internet users or their use of internet resources continues to grow rapidly  such growth may overwhelm the existing internet infrastructure 
our ability to increase the speed with which we provide services to customers and to increase the scope of such services ultimately is limited by and reliant upon the speed and reliability of the networks operated by third parties and these networks may not continue to be developed 
we depend heavily on third party shippers to deliver our products to customers 
we ship approximately of our products to customers by airborne freight corporation d b a airborne express  with the remainder being shipped by united parcel service of america  inc and other overnight delivery and surface services 
a strike or other interruption in service by these shippers could adversely affect our ability to market or deliver products to customers on a timely basis 

table of contents we may experience potential increases in shipping  paper and postage costs  which may adversely affect our business if we are not able to pass such increases on to our customers 
shipping costs are a significant expense in the operation of our business 
increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could significantly impact the cost of producing and mailing our catalogs and shipping customer orders 
postage prices and shipping rates increase periodically and we have no control over future increases 
we have a long term contract with airborne express whereby airborne ships products to our customers 
we believe that we have negotiated favorable shipping rates with airborne 
we generally invoice customers for shipping and handling charges 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on to our customers the full cost  including any future increases in the cost  of commercial delivery services such as airborne 
we also incur substantial paper and postage costs related to our marketing activities  including producing and mailing our catalogs 
paper prices historically have been cyclical and we have experienced substantial increases in the past 
significant increases in postal or shipping rates and paper costs could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly if we cannot pass on such increases to our customers or offset such increases by reducing other costs 
privacy concerns with respect to list development and maintenance may materially adversely affect our business 
we mail catalogs and send electronic messages to names in our proprietary customer database and to potential customers whose names we obtain from rented or exchanged mailing lists 
world wide public concern regarding personal privacy has subjected the rental and use of customer mailing lists and other customer information to increased scrutiny 
any domestic or foreign legislation enacted limiting or prohibiting these practices could negatively affect our business 
we face many uncertainties relating to the collection of state sales or use tax 
we presently collect sales tax on sales of products to residents in many states 
taxable sales to customers were approximately of our net sales during the year ended december  various states have sought to impose on direct marketers the burden of collecting state sales taxes on the sales of products shipped to their residents 
in  the united states supreme court affirmed its position that it is unconstitutional for a state to impose sales or use tax collection obligations on an out of state mail order company whose only contacts with the state are limited to the distribution of catalogs and other advertising materials through the mail and the subsequent delivery of purchased goods by united states mail or by interstate common carrier 
however  legislation that would expand the ability of states to impose sales tax collection obligations on direct marketers has been introduced in congress on many occasions 
due to its presence on various forms of electronic media and other factors  our contact with many states may exceed the contact involved in the supreme court case 
we cannot predict the level of contact that is sufficient to permit a state to impose on us a sales tax collection obligation 
if the supreme court changes its position or if legislation is passed to overturn the supreme court s decision  the imposition of a sales or use tax collection obligation on us in states to which we ship products would result in additional administrative expenses to us  could result in price increases to our customers  and could reduce demand for our product 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our future performance will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior executives 
the competition for qualified management personnel in the computer products industry is very intense  and the loss of service of one or more of these persons could have an adverse effect on our business 
our success and plans for future growth will also depend on our ability to hire  train and retain skilled personnel in all areas of our business  including sales account managers and technical support personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract  train and retain sufficient qualified personnel to achieve our business objectives 

table of contents we are controlled by two principal stockholders 
patricia gallup and david hall  our two principal stockholders  beneficially own or control  in the aggregate  approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
because of their beneficial stock ownership  these stockholders can continue to elect the members of the board of directors and decide all matters requiring stockholder approval at a meeting or by a written consent in lieu of a meeting 
similarly  such stockholders can control decisions to adopt  amend or repeal our charter and our bylaws  or take other actions requiring the vote or consent of our stockholders and prevent a takeover of us by one or more third parties  or sell or otherwise transfer their stock to a third party  which could deprive our stockholders of a control premium that might otherwise be realized by them in connection with an acquisition of us 
such control may result in decisions that are not in the best interest of our public stockholders 
in connection with our initial public offering  the principal stockholders placed substantially all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them into a voting trust  pursuant to which they are required to agree as to the manner of voting such shares in order for the shares to be voted 
such provisions could discourage bids for our common stock at a premium as well as have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
in addition  our unsecured credit agreement provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on the prime rate 
we had no borrowings outstanding pursuant to the credit agreement as of december  we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows should not be material 
our credit agreement exposes earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
however  as noted above  there were no borrowings outstanding on the credit agreement at december   and the average outstanding borrowings during the year were not material 
accordingly  the change in earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates is not material
