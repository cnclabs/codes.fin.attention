overview the major source of revenues for the company is from the engineering services segment  which furnishes engineering consulting services to the petroleum refining  petrochemical  pipeline and processing industries 
in  the engineering services segment accounted for of total revenues for the year 
this segment has been successful in obtaining expanded services in the engineering  procurement and construction epc phases of major projects 
the engineered systems segment revenue was of the total revenues for the year 
the manufacturing segment accounted for of the total revenues 
the company generated a consolidated gross profit in of million or gross margin 
in  consolidated gross profit increased by million from this increase was attributable to the merger in due to the merger  the company realized a significant increase in its revenues as anticipated 
however  positive growth in some work locations was partially offset by revenue decreases in areas more affected by our depressed economy 
overall revenues were up more than million representing a increase 
revenues generated by eei from the beaumont office and esi were greater than anticipated  experiencing growth rates of and  respectively over their results 
eei s beaumont office s increase was primarily due to a large epc contract with a significant client contributing million to revenues  net of million in materials purchased as agent for our client 
the total revenues from beaumont were million which was million greater than esi also had significant sales to a large client who was shipping control systems through out the country  contributing million in revenues 
esi s revenues increased million over the current economics in the industry we serve are poor and most clients are not making large capital expenditures 
many process operators have had such poor margins they are postponing capital improvements unless mandated  such as environmental clean air improvements 
their focus remains on improving margins 
the pipeline industry is over leveraged and in debt 
capital expansions have been put on hold because their primary concern is to reduce their debt 
finally  in general  there is a lack of decisiveness throughout the country caused by a concern over the war in iraq and what may happen militarily with north korea 
the economy of the texas gulf coast remained healthy for refineries while other areas of the country suffered through a weakening of the economy 
these revenue increases in beaumont were offset by reductions in other locations of the company 
the pre merger englobal locations did not have a very good year 
had the merger not taken place  revenues in would have shown a decrease of million from this decrease has resulted both directly and indirectly from the september  terrorist attack and the general malaise of the economy 
the tulsa office has seen a million decrease in sales that resulted in a thousand loss for the year 
the houston office experienced lower revenues of million from englobal constant power experienced a decrease in revenues of thousand  a loss in revenues resulting in a thousand loss in and thermal  which was most significantly effected by the september  attack  had a decrease of revenues of million or and a thousand loss for the rpm office  located in baton rouge  experienced a downturn in the economy in southeast louisiana  also 
the revenues were down for the baton rouge office by million or from had all of the regions performed at their respective levels in  the operating results would have been substantially better

total revenue increased by million or from revenues of million in to million in the revenue growth for compared to is attributable to the acquisition of petrocon 
the acquisition in december  contributed million in revenue in excluding the revenue from the merger  the change in revenues was a decrease from million to million from to  respectively  due primarily to the depressed economics of our clients industries  which places restraints on capital expenditures 
revenue from the engineering services segment  which comprised and of total revenue in and  respectively  increased by million or 
this increase in engineering services revenue was due to the merger with petrocon  which accounted for revenues of million

additionally  the company decided  at the risk of losing profits short term  to maintain key personnel rather than downsize 
the margin as a percentage of revenue  however  decreased from to in to this decrease is primarily due to the shift in types of projects worked in the engineering services segment 
the gross profit for the engineering services segment increased by million or from to the engineering services segment s gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from to 
many of the projects inherited with the merger are client directed  whereby the employee works at the client site  under the supervision of the client 
these jobs are generally low risk  virtually no overhead  and therefore  low margin 
engineering services contributed of the total gross profits in the engineered systems segment gross margin as a percentage of sales increased from in to in this increase was attributable to the merger 
esi has higher profit  higher risk  fixed fee projects 
ecp also experienced a write off of inventory in that was not repeated in  thereby increasing the margins 
the manufacturing segment s gross profit decreased by million from million to million or to from to  respectively 
this decrease is attributable to the sluggish economy 
selling  general and administrative expenses

gross profit increased by million or from million in to million in the gross margin for the engineering services segment increased by million or from to the engineering services segment s gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from in to 
this was attributable to increased margins on higher risk fixed fee projects begun during the period and to rate increases on blanket contracts 
engineering services contributed of the total gross profits in the engineered systems segment gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in this decrease was attributable to increases in direct labor costs  other production costs  and adjustments to raw material and work in process inventory that effect material costs 
in addition  write offs of obsolete inventory contributed to lower gross profits 
management believes the adjustments and write offs will have a one time effect and will not occur in future periods 
the manufacturing segment s gross profit increased by million from million to million or to from to  respectively 
this increase is attributable to the manufacturing segment bidding jobs with higher margins and to a substantial number of orders at premium margins with expedited shipping dates during the period

with the merger  the company assumed million of englobal engineering s debt 
as of december   englobal has working capital of million 
in addition  the long term debt outstanding is million 
the long term debt includes the line of credit of million  other long term debt of million 
additionally  the company has long term capital leases of million 
under the terms and conditions of its senior credit facility  englobal had a borrowing capacity of approximately million after consideration of the borrowing base limitations 
there are no other standby letters of credit  guarantee  repurchase obligations  or other commitments 
there are no off balance sheet arrangements 
listed below is a maturity schedule 
maturities of long term debt and leases in thousands are as follows capital debt leases total long term obligations 
 englobal has obligations under non cancelable operating leases for certain equipment and office space expiring in various years through minimum annual rental commitments at december  in thousands are rentals and thereafter  total operating leases 
 englobal has entered into a revolving credit facility with fleet capital corporation fleet as part of the merger transaction with englobal engineering 
this credit facility replaced a revolving credit note with frost bank and is senior to all other debt and includes a line of credit that is limited to million  subject to borrowing base restrictions 
the line of credit is collateralized by eligible trade accounts receivable and substantially all of the other assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
eligible accounts are any account arising in the ordinary course of englobal or subsidiary company s business  which are due and unpaid no more than days after the original invoice date 
englobal s financial covenants under the senior credit facility are based on monthly senior debt to ebitda  cumulative fixed charge ratio and cost in excess of billings maximum amount 
negative covenants in the agreement require englobal to have fleet s written consent before making capital expenditures which in the aggregate exceed million  making sales during any calendar year on a bill and hold basis in excess of million  and becoming a lessee under any operating lease of property if the aggregate rentals payable during any current or future period of twelve consecutive months would exceed million 
the agreement also limits collateral eligibility on accounts arising out of fixed cost contracts to total unpaid amount to million and on performance accounts with respect to accrued time on cost reimbursable contracts to million 
at december   million was outstanding on the line of credit 
the line of credit matures on june  at which time the company intends to refinance with fleet or another bank 
the interest rate on the line of credit is one quarter of one percent plus prime percent at december   and the commitment fee on the unused line of credit is percent 
the remaining borrowings available under the line of credit as of december  were million after consideration of the borrowing base limitations 
the englobal credit facility with fleet capital corporation contains covenants that require the maintenance of certain ratios  including cumulative fixed charge coverage and various other covenants 
the status of the covenants is reported to fleet monthly beginning with december  the breach of specific covenants or other events shall constitute an event of default under the terms of the agreement 
upon or at anytime after the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default  all or any portion of the obligations under the agreement shall  at the option of fleet  become at once due and payable 
also  while an event of default exists  the principal amount of all loans shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to two percent above the current rate 
the company was not in violation of the covenants during effective december   an amendment to the credit facility agreed upon by fleet and the company increased the limits on capital expenditures 
the company must meet all covenants through the maturity date of the credit facility 
we believe the company will remain in compliance with all the loan covenants although no assurances can be given 
prior to the merger  englobal engineering had a promissory note with equus ii incorporated equus with a balance of million and a series b junior subordinated promissory note with equus with a balance of million 
as part of the merger  the equus notes were restructured  reorganized  and reduced through the payment of million in cash  the issuance of million in preferred stock and a new note issued for million 
the remaining balance of million was forgiven 
the equus note is subordinate to the fleet credit facility 
on december   at a special meeting of the stockholders of englobal   shares of preferred stock were authorized for issuance 
in addition  the stockholders approved the issuance of  shares of englobal convertible preferred stock to equus  entitling equus to receive cumulative dividends at an annual rate of payable in cash or in kind 
the rights  preferences and limitations of the convertible preferred stock are as follows 
holders of the convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of per share  subject to adjustments relating to future issuances of common stock or re capitalizations  if the company liquidates  dissolves or winds up before any distribution or if payment is made for the benefit of the holders of our common stock  
at any time  englobal is entitled to redeem all or part of but not less than of the shares of convertible preferred stock then outstanding of the convertible preferred stock outstanding at a price equal to the then effective liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends  
at any time after the seventh anniversary date of the issuance of the convertible preferred stock  the holders of not less than two thirds of the then outstanding convertible preferred stock may demand mandatory redemption of all but not less than all of the convertible preferred stock then outstanding at a price equal to the then effective liquidation preference plus accrued but unpaid dividends  
holders of the convertible preferred stock have the right to vote on changes to the articles of incorporation that adversely effect them  and  as long as  shares of series a preferred stock are outstanding  they also have the right to approve issuances of any senior shares  
holders of the convertible preferred stock have the right  at such holders option  to convert all or a portion of their convertible preferred stock into shares of our common stock at the rate of one share of common stock for each shares of preferred stock

the shares of convertible preferred stock are subject to mandatory conversion at the option of englobal if the closing price of englobal common stock for consecutive amex trading days exceeds a price of  with such price to be adjusted to reflect future issuances of common stock or re capitalizations 
the company does not engage in trading in commodity contracts 
nor does the company have any foreign currency exposure 
cash flow operating activities provided net cash totaling million  thousand  and thousand during   and respectively 
the company s cash flow from operating activities has increased significantly due to the growth in the engineering segment  resulting from the merger 
investing activities used cash totaling million in as compared to thousand being generated in and thousand used in in  the company s investing activities consisted of capital additions of thousand primarily for computers and construction in progress consisting of the upgrade and customization of accounting software of thousand 
in  the company redeemed bonds held as an investment and in  the company purchased bonds 
financing activities used cash totaling million  provided thousand  and provided thousand during   and respectively 
the company s primary financing mechanism is through its line of credit 
the line of credit has been used principally to finance accounts receivable 
during  repayments were made on the other long term debt 
the merger with petrocon in december was a million non cash purchase transaction made through the issuance of common and preferred stock and assumption of debt 
during  insurance was acquired through a note payable and preferred dividends of thousand were issued in the form of additional preferred stock 
refunds of thousand were received during from state authorities for franchise taxes related to prior years for the petrocon companies 
the company believes that it has available necessary cash for the next months 
cash and the availability of cash  could be materially restricted if circumstances prevent the timely internal processing of invoices into receivable accounts  if such accounts are not collected within days of the original invoice date  or if project mix shifts from cost reimbursable to fixed costs contracts during significant periods of growth 
if losses occur  englobal may not be able to meet the monthly fixed charge ratio covenant 
in that event  if englobal is unable to obtain a waiver or amendment of the covenant  englobal may be unable to borrow under the credit facility and may have to repay all loans then outstanding under the credit facility 
englobal does not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or otherwise 
furthermore  we have not engaged in energy or commodity trading activities and do not anticipate doing so in the future  nor do we have any transactions involving unconsolidated entities or special purpose entities 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in the future payments due by period in thousands and thereafter total long term debt    capital leases operating leases    total contractual cash obligations      asset management the company s cash flow from operations has been affected primarily by the timing of its collection of trade accounts receivable 
the company typically sells its products and services on short term credit terms and seeks to minimize its credit risk by performing credit checks and conducting its own collection efforts 
the company had trade accounts receivable increase to million from million as of december  and  respectively  primarily due to the increased sales in the beaumont area 
the number of days sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable improved from days to days at december  and december   respectively as a result of shortening the billing cycle and becoming more aggressive in our collection efforts 
bad debt expenses have been insignificant approximately and 
in and  respectively for each of these periods 
related party transactions englobal engineering leases office space from pei investments  a joint venture in which englobal engineering has a one third interest  mike burrow the company s ceo has a one third interest  and a stockholder who owns less than of the company s common stock has a one third interest 
rentals paid under the lease were million for  and this lease expired in and has a present annual rental rate of million 
englobal engineering expects to renegotiate the lease during the company believes that this lease is at a commercially reasonable rental rate 
risk management in performing services for its clients  the company could potentially be liable for breach of contract  personal injury  property damage  or negligence  including professional errors and omissions 
englobal often agrees to indemnify its clients for losses and expenses incurred by them as a result of the company s negligence and  in certain cases  the concurrent negligence of the clients 
the company s quality control and assurance program includes a control function to establish standards and procedures for performance and for documentation of project tasks  and an assurance function to audit and to monitor compliance with procedures and quality standards 
englobal maintains liability insurance for bodily injury and third party property damage  professional errors and omissions  and workers compensation coverage  which it considers sufficient to insure against these risks  subject to self insured amounts 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company s revenues are composed of engineering service revenue and product sales 
the company recognizes service revenue as soon as such services are performed and product sales upon shipment to the customer 
the majority of its services are provided through cost plus contracts  many of which have not to exceed provisions 
these time and material billings are produced every two weeks 
on occasion  the company  serving as purchasing agent on behalf of a client  procures subcontractors  material  and equipment whose cost is passed on to the client with no mark up or profit 
in accordance with statement of position sop  revenues and costs for these type purchases are not included in total revenues and costs 
for financial reporting this pass through type of transaction is reported net 
profits and losses on fixed fee contracts are recorded on the percentage of completion method of accounting  measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs for each contract 
contract costs include amounts paid to subcontractors 
anticipated losses on uncompleted construction contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses can be estimated 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
the asset  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed on fixed fee contracts 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated profits on uncompleted contracts represents amounts billed in excess of revenues recognized on fixed fee contracts 
use of estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying results 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
one example includes the estimates of uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes the accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  and changes in our customers payment trends when evaluating the provisions for bad debts 
goodwill in conjunction with each acquisition  the company must allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
as additional information becomes available  adjustments may be made to the original estimates within a short time subsequent to the acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but instead is periodically assessed for impairment 
the impairment testing entails estimating future net cash flows relating to the asset  based on management s estimate of market conditions including pricing  demand  competition  operating costs and other factors 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired involves professional judgment and is ultimately based on management s assessment of the value of the assets acquired 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
consistent with sfas  the company has not amortized goodwill related to the merger  but instead tested the balance for impairment 
litigation the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of its business 
based on legal analysis and advise from its attorneys  allowances have been made for any litigation that management of the company believes could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of englobal corporation and all wholly owned subsidiaries 
englobal corporation has no affiliates whose ownership is less than 
all intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in the consolidation 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in the report 
any of the following risks  if they actually occur  would harm our business and the value of the stock price 
the united states and global response to the war with iraq  terrorism  and perceived nuclear threats increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our clients and  therefore  the company s business and results of operations 
many of our contracts specify hourly rates composed of mark ups over the hourly rate paid to the employee 
these rates are subject to modification for statutory changes  only 
if the cost of health care continues to rise at double digit rates  or if commercial insurance increases due to extraordinary circumstances such as the september terrorist attack  the profit margin on these contracts will erode 
in order to be competitive  we must make substantial investment in technological advances of engineering software and related computers and hardware 
if we do not have sufficient resources to fund future capital expenditures  the results of operations could be affected adversely 
if our ability to attract and retain qualified professionals is impaired  the company s reputation could be harmed in the marketplace and restrict our ability to implement and ultimately achieve our business strategy 
if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  we could incur unforeseen costs or delays and our reputation and reliability in the marketplace could be damaged 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
thus  it is possible that in the future some of our quarterly results of operations may be below the expectations of the market analysts and our investors  and the share price of our equity shares could decline significantly 
we could incur losses if we fail to accurately estimate our costs on fixed price contracts or contracts with not to exceed provisions 
our contracts with our customers do not commit our customers to provide us with a specific volume of business and can typically be terminated by our clients with or without cause  with little or no advance notice and without penalty 
this could reduce our revenues significantly 
additionally  our fixed price contracts with clients typically are limited to a specific project without any commitment for future work 
our growth strategy includes possible acquisitions 
acquisitions involve various inherent risks  such as 
our ability to accurately assess the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates  
the potential loss of key personnel of the acquired entity  
our ability to integrate acquired businesses and to achieve identified financial  operating  and other synergies anticipated to result from the acquisition  and 
unanticipated changes in the business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business 
while the company believes its control systems are effective  there are inherent limitations in all control systems  and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
the company continues to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls  disclosure controls and other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  however  there can be no assurance that any design of controls will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions
