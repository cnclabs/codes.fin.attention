item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities and exchange act of these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  those mentioned in this report and  in particular  the factors described below under additional factors that may affect future results 
landec undertakes no obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
overview since its inception in october  the company has been engaged in the research and development of its intelimer technology and related products 
the company has launched four product lines from this core development quickcast tm splints and casts  in april  which was subsequently sold to bissell healthcare corporation in august  intellipac breathable membranes for the fresh cut and whole produce packaging market  in september  intelimer polymer systems for the industrial specialties market in june  and intellicoat coated inbred corn seeds in the fall of with the acquisition of landec ag in september and apio in december  the company is focused on two core businesses food products technology and agricultural seed technology 
the food products technology segment combines the company s intellipac breathable membrane technology with apio s fresh cut produce business 
the agricultural seed technology segment integrates the intellicoat seed coating technology with fielder s choice s direct marketing  telephone sales and e commerce distribution capabilities 
the company also operates a technology licensing research and development business which develops products to be licensed outside of the company s core businesses 
see business description of core business 
the company has been unprofitable during each fiscal year since its inception 
from inception through october   the company s accumulated deficit was million 
the company may incur additional losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reach or sustain profitability for an entire fiscal year 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates use of estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the judgements and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
notes and advances receivables apio has made advances to fruit growers for the development of orchards  and to produce growers for crop and harvesting costs 
typically  except for development advances  these advances are paid off within the growing season less than one year from harvested crops 
development advances and advances not fully paid during the current growing season are converted to interest bearing obligations  evidenced by contracts and notes receivable 
these notes receivable and advances are secured by perfected liens on land and or crops and have terms that range from twelve to sixty months 
notes receivable are periodically reviewed at least quarterly for collectibility 
a reserve is established for any note or advance deemed to not be fully collectible based upon an estimate of the crop value or the fair value of the security for the note or advance 
if crop prices or the fair value of the underlying security declines the company may be unable to fully recoup its investment and the estimated losses would rise in the current period  potentially to the extent of the total investment 
investments in farming activities investments in farming activities consist of cash advances to growers for expenses to be incurred during the growing season  in exchange for a percentage ownership in the proceeds of the crops 
net income or loss is generally recognized on these investments based on the company s percentage ownership of the net proceeds of the crops as fields are harvested and proceeds are settled 
these investments are periodically reviewed for impairment at least quarterly 
additionally  certain farming agreements contain provisions wherein the company bears the risk of loss if the net proceeds from the crops are not sufficient to cover the expense incurred 
if crop prices decline the company may be unable to fully recoup its investment and the estimated losses would rise in the current period  potentially to the extent of the total investment 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
bad debt losses are partially mitigated due to low risks related to the fact that the company s customers are predominantly large financially sound national and regional retailers and because the company carries foreign credit insurance to cover a portion of its foreign receivables exposure 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these provisions are determined based on specific identification for unuseable inventory and a general reserve  based on historical losses  for inventory considered to be useable 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowances are established for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns  and discounts 
if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience  additional allowances may be required 
licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
initial license fees are deferred and amortized over the period of the agreement to revenue when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees are recognized over the research and development period of the agreement  as well as the term of any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
prior to november   the company recognized noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees as revenue when received and when all significant contractual obligations of the company relating to the fees had been met 
effective november   the company changed its method of accounting for noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees to recognize such fees over the research and development period of the agreement  as well as the term of any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
the company believes the change in accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
the million cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  calculated as of november   was reported as a charge in the year ended october  the cumulative effect was initially recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as revenue over the research and development period or supply period commitment of the agreement 
during the year ended october  the impact of the change in accounting was to increase net loss by approximately million  or per share  comprised of the million cumulative effect of the change as described above per share  net of  of the related deferred revenue which was recognized as recycled revenue during per share 
during fiscal years and   and  respectively  of the related deferred revenue was recognized as recycled revenue 
the remainder of the related deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue per fiscal year as follows  in  and  in the pro forma amounts presented in the consolidated statement of operations were calculated assuming the accounting change was made retroactive to prior periods 
contract revenue for research and development r d is recorded as earned  based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and there is no continuing involvement by the company  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective october  and will be required to evaluate its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually 
this evaluation incorporates a variety of estimates including the fair value of the company s operating segments 
if the carrying value of an operating segment s assets exceeds the estimated fair value  the company would likely be required to record an impairment loss  possibly for the entire carrying balance of goodwill and intangible assets 
to date no impairment losses have been incurred 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
the company is in the process of assessing the effect of adopting sfas  which will be effective for the company s fiscal year ending october  results of operations the company s results of operations reflect only the continuing operations of the company and do not include the results of the discontinued dock resins operation 
fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october total revenues were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year revenues from product sales and services decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease in product sales and service revenues was primarily due to decreased revenues from apio s fee for service whole produce business  which decreased from million in fiscal year to million during fiscal year the decrease in the fee for service whole produce business is primarily due to the company s decision during the third quarter of fiscal year to exit the cash  labor and equipment intensive field harvesting and packing operations of its fee for service business  which resulted in decreased volumes during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year volumes in the fee for service business are expected to be relatively flat in the foreseeable future as the company focuses on higher margin  less cash intensive aspects of its businesses 
the decrease in apio s fee for service revenue was partially offset by an increase in revenues from apio s value added specialty packaging business which increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year in addition  revenues from landec ag increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in landec ag revenues was due to an increase in sales volume and a higher average selling price per unit 
revenues from research  development and royalties increased to million in fiscal year compared to  for fiscal year revenues from license fees increased to million in fiscal year compared to  for fiscal year the increases in research  development  royalties and license fee revenues were due to the company entering into new collaborations with ucb in december and with a major medical device company in april cost of product sales and services consists of material  labor and overhead 
cost of product sales and services was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year gross profit from product sales and services as a percentage of revenue from product sales and services increased to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year overall gross profit increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a million gross profit increase at landec ag which increased its gross profit to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year in addition  gross profit from landec s licensing business increased million to million in fiscal year from  in fiscal year apio s gross profit decreased slightly to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was due to several offsetting reasons  in fiscal year apio realized income from farming of million compared to a loss of million in fiscal year  higher crop sourcing costs of approximately million during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to the unusually cold winter in the desert areas of california and arizona  lower volumes in the fee for service business during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as a result of discontinuing the field harvesting and packing operations of the business in the third quarter of fiscal year resulting in a million decrease in gross profit  and losses of  from the initial launch of the banana packaging technology 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year landec s research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses related to new product development  process scale up work  and investments in patents to protect the intellectual property content of landec s enabling side chain crystallizable polymers 
the increase in research and development expenses was due to increased development costs associated with the company s banana program 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  a decrease of 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with landec s product sales and services  business development expenses  and staff and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to intangible amortization expenses decreasing million as a result of the adoption of sfas this decrease was partially offset by increased selling  general and administrative expenses at apio as a result of expenses related to apio s new erp business operating system 
specifically  sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year interest income for fiscal year was  compared to  for fiscal year this decrease in interest income was due principally to lower market interest rates and a lower interest bearing notes receivable balance 
interest expense for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to having a lower average debt balance outstanding during fiscal year due to paying down debt by nearly million during fiscal year fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october total revenues were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year revenues from product sales and services decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease in product sales and service revenues was primarily due to decreased revenues from apio s fee for service whole produce business  which decreased from million in fiscal year to million during fiscal year the decrease in the fee for service whole produce business is primarily due to the company s decision during the third quarter of fiscal year to exit the cash  labor and equipment intensive field harvesting and packing operations of its fee for service business  which resulted in decreased volumes during fiscal year the decrease in apio s fee for service revenue was partially offset by an increase in revenues from apio s value added specialty packaging business which increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and the fact that apio was included for a full year in fiscal year compared to only eleven months in fiscal year revenues from research  development and royalties were  for fiscal year compared to  for fiscal year revenues from license fees remained unchanged at  for fiscal years and cost of product sales and services was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year gross profit from product sales and services as a percentage of revenue from product sales and services remained unchanged at in fiscal years and overall gross profit decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to gross profit from apio s fee for service business which decreased million to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in apio s gross profit was primarily due to farming losses from the winter season produce sourcing  which increased to million in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  higher crop sourcing costs during the first half of fiscal year as compared to fiscal year and  lower volumes during the second half of fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as a result of discontinuing the field harvesting and packing operations of the business 
gross profit also decreased  at landec ag due to lower product sales in fiscal year compared to fiscal year these decreases in gross profit were partially offset by increased gross profit from apio s value added specialty packaging business which increased million in fiscal year to million as compared to million in fiscal year research and development expenses remained virtually the same at million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of increased expenses at apio for general and administrative expenses due to including apio for a full year in fiscal year compared to only eleven months in fiscal year this increase was offset by decreased sales and marketing expenses at landec ag from a february reduction in force 
specifically  sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year interest income for fiscal year was  compared to  for fiscal year this decrease in interest income was due principally to less cash available for investing and lower market interest rates 
interest expense for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the increase in interest expense was primarily due to having a higher average debt balance outstanding during fiscal year liquidity and capital resources as of october   landec had cash and cash equivalents of million  a net decrease of  from million as of october  this decrease was primarily due to a the reduction of net borrowings under landec s lines of credit of million  b the reduction of long term debt of million  c the purchase of million of property and equipment  partially offset by  d net proceeds from the sale of dock resins of million  and e proceeds from the sale of common stock of million 
during fiscal year  landec purchased equipment to support the development of apio s value added products  and incurred building and laboratory improvement costs at apio 
these expenditures represented the majority of the million of property and equipment purchased during fiscal year in december  in conjunction with the acquisition of apio  the company secured million of term debt and a million line of credit with bank of america 
the term debt and line of credit agreements  as amended loan agreement contain restrictive covenants that require apio to meet certain financial tests  including minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum current ratio  minimum adjusted net worth and maximum leverage ratios 
as of october   apio was in compliance with all of its financial covenants 
the loan agreement  through restricted payment covenants and amendments  limits the ability of apio to make cash payments to landec 
landec has pledged substantially all of the assets of apio to bank of america pursuant to the loan agreement 
at october   million was outstanding under apio s line of credit at an annual interest rate of 
the total principal amount plus accrued interest outstanding under the line of credit is due and payable in full on january  landec intends to enter into a million replacement line of credit to cover the outstanding amount of the current facility and for future financing 
the term loan was paid off on october  in may  apio entered into a capital lease agreement to fund the majority of the costs of a new erp business system 
as of october   million was outstanding under this lease agreement 
landec ag has a revolving line of credit which allows for borrowings of up to million  based on landec ag s inventory levels 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is the prime rate plus 
the line of credit contains certain restrictive covenants  which  among other things  affect the ability of landec ag to make payments on debt owed by landec ag to landec 
landec has pledged substantially all of the assets of landec ag to secure the line of credit 
in december  landec ag increased its line of credit by million to million through january at october   million was outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
in addition   was outstanding on landec ag s four year  per annum  term note and is due and payable in full in june in march  the company raised million  net of  of expenses  through a private placement of million shares of common stock 
in june  the company sold its reedley  ca fruit processing facility for net proceeds of million  resulting in a gain of  in october  the company sold its wholly owned subsidiary dock resins and received million of cash  net of the repayment of million of dock resin s debt 
in january  an additional million in cash was received by landec because of an increase in dock resins working capital as specified in the stock purchase agreement 
at october   landec s total debt  including current maturities and capital lease obligations  was approximately million and the total debt to equity ratio was approximately as compared to at october  of this debt  approximately million is comprised of revolving lines of credit and approximately million is comprised of term debt and capital lease obligations  million of which is mortgage debt on apio s manufacturing facilities 
the amount of debt outstanding on landec s revolving lines of credit fluctuates over time  and the agreements contain financial and other limiting covenants 
borrowings on landec s lines of credit are expected to vary with seasonal requirements of the company s businesses 
in addition  in connection with landec s acquisition of apio  landec is obligated to pay the former owners of apio million in the first quarter of fiscal year  million in fiscal years and  and an additional million in periodic scheduled payments through february the company s material contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of october  are as follows in thousands due in fiscal year obligation total thereafter lines of credit   long term debt      capital leases  operating leases  land leases earn out liability   licensing obligation  total      landec believes that its debt facilities  cash from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and existing borrowing capacities will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
landec s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of its research and development programs  the development of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  the development of marketing  sales and distribution capabilities  the ability of landec to establish and maintain new collaborative and licensing arrangements  any decision to pursue additional acquisition opportunities  weather conditions that can affect the supply and price of produce  the timing and amount  if any  of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the ability to comply with regulatory requirements  the emergence of competitive technology and market forces  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  and other factors 
if landec s currently available funds  together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its capital needs  landec would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners  additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to landec on favorable terms if at all 
additional factors that may affect future results landec desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and of section e and rule b under the securities exchange act of specifically  landec wishes to alert readers that the following important factors  as well as other factors including  without limitation  those described elsewhere in this report  could in the future affect  and in the past have affected  landec s actual results and could cause landec s results for future periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of landec 
landec assumes no obligation to update such forward looking statements 
we have a history of losses which may continue we have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since our inception 
our accumulated deficit as of october  totaled million 
we may incur additional losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is highly uncertain and we may never generate significant revenues or achieve profitability 
our substantial indebtedness could limit our financial and operating flexibility at october   our total debt  including current maturities and capital lease obligations  was approximately million and the total debt to equity ratio was approximately 
of this debt  approximately million is comprised of revolving lines of credit and approximately million is comprised of term debt and capital lease obligations 
the amount of debt outstanding on our revolving lines of credit fluctuates over time  and the agreements contain financial and other limiting covenants 
all million outstanding under the revolving lines of credit is due in fiscal year of our term debt and capital lease obligations  approximately million  million and million become due over each of the next three fiscal years  respectively 
this level of indebtedness limits our financial and operating flexibility in the following ways o a substantial portion of net cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service and will not be available for other purposes  o our ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future for working capital is reduced  o our ability to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited  o our ability to react to changes in the industry and economic conditions generally may be limited 
in connection with the apio acquisition  we may be obligated to make future payments to the former shareholders of apio of up to million  plus an additional  of accrued interest  for a performance based earn out and future supply of produce 
of this amount  million relates to the earn out from fiscal year that is due to be paid in periodic scheduled payments through february and million relates to payments to be made in january  and our ability to service this indebtedness and these future payments will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to service this debt  we would be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies such as selling assets  restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital  which might not be successful and which could substantially dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders 
we have violated restrictions in our loan agreements and may have to pursue new financings if we are unable to comply with these provisions in the future apio is subject to various financial and operating covenants under its term debt and line of credit facilities the loan agreement  including minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum current ratio  minimum adjusted net worth and maximum leverage ratios 
on january   apio was in technical violation of the minimum fixed charge ratio 
on february   this violation was cured through a subordinated contribution to apio from landec  retroactive to january  the loan agreement limits the ability of apio to make cash payments to landec until the outstanding balance is reduced to an amount specified in the loan agreement 
landec ag is subject to certain restrictive covenants in its loan agreements which limit the ability of landec ag to make payments on debt owed to landec 
we have pledged substantially all of apio s and landec ag s assets to secure their bank debt 
we currently are not in violation of any of the provisions of the loan agreement but if we violate any obligations in the future we could trigger an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of our obligation to repay the indebtedness due under the loan agreement 
if the indebtedness due under the loan agreement were accelerated  we would be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies such as selling assets  seeking new debt financing from another lender or seeking additional equity capital  which might not be achievable or available on attractive terms  if at all  and which could substantially dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders 
our future operating results are likely to fluctuate which may cause our stock price to decline in the past  our results of operations have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
historically  our direct marketer of hybrid corn seed  landec ag  has been the primary source of these fluctuations  as its revenues and profits are concentrated over a few months during the spring planting season generally during our second quarter 
in addition  apio can be heavily affected by seasonal and weather factors which have impacted quarterly results  such as the high cost of sourcing product during the first quarter of fiscal year due to a shortage of essential value added produce items which had to be purchased at inflated prices on the open market in december and january our earnings may also fluctuate based on our ability to collect accounts receivables from customers and note receivables from growers 
our earnings from our food products technology business are sensitive to price fluctuations in the fresh vegetables and fruits markets 
excess supplies can cause intense price competition 
other factors that affect our food and or agricultural operations include o the seasonality of our supplies  o our ability to process produce during critical harvest periods  o the timing and effects of ripening  o the degree of perishability  o the effectiveness of worldwide distribution systems  o total worldwide industry volumes  o the seasonality of consumer demand  o foreign currency fluctuations  and o foreign importation restrictions and foreign political risks 
as a result of these and other factors  we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results  and we may never reach or sustain profitability for an entire fiscal year 
we may not be able to achieve acceptance of our new products in the marketplace our success in generating significant sales of our products will depend in part on the ability of us and our partners and licensees to achieve market acceptance of our new products and technology 
the extent to which  and rate at which  we achieve market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products is a function of many variables including  but not limited to o price  o safety  o efficacy  o reliability  o conversion costs  o marketing and sales efforts  and o general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
we may not be able to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner or new products and technologies may not gain market acceptance 
we are in the early stage of product commercialization of certain intellipac breathable membrane  intellicoat seed coating and other intelimer polymer products and many of our potential products are in development 
we believe that our future growth will depend in large part on our ability to develop and market new products in our target markets and in new markets 
in particular  we expect that our ability to compete effectively with existing food products  agricultural  industrial and medical companies will depend substantially on successfully developing  commercializing  achieving market acceptance of and reducing the cost of producing our products 
in addition  commercial applications of our temperature switch polymer technology are relatively new and evolving 
our failure to develop new products or the failure of our new products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face strong competition in the marketplace competitors may succeed in developing alternative technologies and products that are more effective  easier to use or less expensive than those which have been or are being developed by us or that would render our technology and products obsolete and non competitive 
we operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving fields  and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
competition from large food products  agricultural  industrial and medical companies is expected to be intense 
in addition  the nature of our collaborative arrangements may result in our corporate partners and licensees becoming our competitors 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than we do  and may have substantially greater experience in conducting clinical and field trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing commercial products 
we have limited manufacturing experience and a concentration of capacity in one location for apio and may have to depend on third parties to manufacture our products any disruptions in our primary manufacturing operation would reduce our ability to sell our products and would have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
additionally  we may need to consider seeking collaborative arrangements with other companies to manufacture our products 
if we become dependent upon third parties for the manufacture of our products  our profit margins and our ability to develop and deliver those products on a timely basis may be affected 
failures by third parties may impair our ability to deliver products on a timely basis and impair our competitive position 
we may not be able to continue to successfully operate our manufacturing operations at acceptable costs  with acceptable yields  and retain adequately trained personnel 
our dependence on single source suppliers and service providers may cause disruption in our operations should any supplier fail to deliver materials we may experience difficulty acquiring materials or services for the manufacture of our products or we may not be able to obtain substitute vendors 
we may not be able to procure comparable materials or hybrid corn varieties at similar prices and terms within a reasonable time 
several services that are provided to apio are obtained from a single provider 
several of the raw materials we use to manufacture our products are currently purchased from a single source  including some monomers used to synthesize intelimer polymers and substrate materials for our breathable membrane products 
in addition  virtually all of the hybrid corn varieties sold by landec ag are sourced from a single seed producer 
any interruption of our relationship with single source suppliers or service providers could delay product shipments and materially harm our business 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights we have received  and may in the future receive  from third parties  including some of our competitors  notices claiming that we are infringing their patents or other proprietary rights 
if we were determined to be infringing any third party patent  we could be required to pay damages  alter our products or processes  obtain licenses or cease the infringing activities 
if we are required to obtain any licenses  we may not be able to do so on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
litigation  which could result in substantial costs to and diversion of our efforts  may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
any litigation or interference proceeding  regardless of outcome  could be expensive and time consuming and could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using that technology 
our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
any pending patent applications we file may not be approved and we may not be able to develop additional proprietary products that are patentable 
any patents issued to us may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties 
patents held by others may prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technology 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our patents 
our operations are subject to regulations that directly impact our business our food packaging products are subject to regulation under the fdc act 
under the fdc act  any substance that when used as intended may reasonably be expected to become  directly or indirectly  a component or otherwise affect the characteristics of any food may be regulated as a food additive unless the substance is generally recognized as safe 
we believe that food packaging materials are generally not considered food additives by the fda because these products are not expected to become components of food under their expected conditions of use 
we consider our intellipac breathable membrane product to be a food packaging material not subject to regulation or approval by the fda 
we have not received any communication from the fda concerning our intellipac breathable membrane product 
if the fda were to determine that our intellipac breathable membrane products are food additives  we may be required to submit a food additive petition for approval by the fda 
the food additive petition process is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
a determination by the fda that a food additive petition is necessary would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
federal  state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the use  storage  discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals and gases used in some of the manufacturing processes 
in most cases  we believe our liability will be limited to sharing clean up or other remedial costs with other potentially responsible parties 
our failure to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial liability or could cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended and changes in environmental regulations may impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements 
our agricultural operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws including  the food quality protection act of  the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act 
compliance with these laws and related regulations is an ongoing process 
environmental concerns are  however  inherent in most agricultural operations  including those we conduct 
moreover  it is possible that future developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and enforcement policies could result in increased compliance costs 
the company is subject to the perishable agricultural commodities act paca law 
paca regulates fair trade standards in the fresh produce industry and governs all the product sold by apio 
our failure to comply with the paca requirements could among other things  result in civil penalties  suspension or revocation of a license to sell produce  and in the most egregious cases  criminal prosecution  which could have a material adverse affect on our business adverse weather conditions and other acts of god may cause substantial decreases in our sales and or increases in our costs our food products and agricultural seed technology businesses are subject to weather conditions that affect commodity prices  crop yields  and decisions by growers regarding crops to be planted 
crop diseases and severe conditions  particularly weather conditions such as floods  droughts  frosts  windstorms and hurricanes  may adversely affect the supply of vegetables and fruits used in our business  which could reduce the sales volumes and or increase the unit production costs 
because a significant portion of the costs are fixed and contracted in advance of each operating year  volume declines due to production interruptions or other factors could result in increases in unit production costs which could result in substantial losses and weaken our financial condition 
we depend on strategic partners and licenses for future development our strategy for development  clinical and field testing  manufacture  commercialization and marketing for some of our current and future products includes entering into various collaborations with corporate partners  licensees and others 
we are dependent on our corporate partners to develop  test  manufacture and or market some of our products 
although we believe that our partners in these collaborations have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities  the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities are not within our control 
our partners may not perform their obligations as expected or we may not derive any additional revenue from the arrangements 
our partners may not pay any additional option or license fees to us or may not develop  market or pay any royalty fees related to products under the agreements 
moreover  some of the collaborative agreements provide that they may be terminated at the discretion of the corporate partner  and some of the collaborative agreements provide for termination under other circumstances 
in addition  we may not receive any royalties on future sales of quickcast tm and port tm products because we no longer have control over the sales of those products 
our partners may pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to our technology 
furthermore  we may not be able to negotiate additional collaborative arrangements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all  and our collaborative arrangements may not be successful 
both domestic and foreign government regulations can have an adverse effect on our business operations our products and operations are subject to governmental regulation in the united states and foreign countries 
the manufacture of our products is subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities 
we may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive approvals or loss of previously received approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we have no reason to believe that we will not be able to comply with all applicable regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products and polymer materials  regulations are always subject to change and depend heavily on administrative interpretations and the country in which the products are sold 
future changes in regulations or interpretations relating to matters such as safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  environmental controls  and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances may adversely affect our business 
we are subject to usda rules and regulations concerning the safety of the food products handled and sold by apio  and the facilities in which they are packed and processed 
failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in o fines  injunctions  civil penalties  and suspensions  o withdrawal of regulatory approvals  o product recalls and product seizures  including cessation of manufacturing and sales  o operating restrictions  and o criminal prosecution 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with the laws and regulations in the future which may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our international operations and sales may expose our business to additional risks for fiscal year  approximately of our total revenues were derived from product sales to international customers 
a number of risks are inherent in international transactions 
international sales and operations may be limited or disrupted by any of the following o regulatory approval process  o government controls  o export license requirements  o political instability  o price controls  o trade restrictions  o changes in tariffs  or o difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
foreign regulatory agencies have or may establish product standards different from those in the united states  and any inability to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our international business  and our financial condition and results of operations 
while our foreign sales are currently priced in dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  may reduce the demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries to which the products are sold 
regulatory  geopolitical and other factors may adversely impact our operations in the future or require us to modify our current business practices 
cancellations or delays of orders by our customers may adversely affect our business during fiscal year  sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately of our revenues  with our top customers  wal mart stores inc  accounting for approximately and costco wholesale corp  accounting for approximately of our revenues 
we expect that  for the foreseeable future  a limited number of customers may continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenues 
we may experience changes in the composition of our customer base  as apio and landec ag have experienced in the past 
we do not have long term purchase agreements with any of our customers 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers for any reason or the loss of one or more of our major customers could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  since some of the products processed by apio at its guadalupe  california facility are often sole sourced to its customers  our operating results could be adversely affected if one or more of our major customers were to develop other sources of supply 
our current customers may not continue to place orders  orders by existing customers may be canceled or may not continue at the levels of previous periods or we may not be able to obtain orders from new customers 
our sale of some products may increase our exposure to product liability claims the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of the products we develop involves an inherent risk of allegations of product liability 
if any of our products were determined or alleged to be contaminated or defective or to have caused a harmful accident to an end customer  we could incur substantial costs in responding to complaints or litigation regarding our products and our product brand image could be materially damaged 
either event may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
although we have taken and intend to continue to take what we believe are appropriate precautions to minimize exposure to product liability claims  we may not be able to avoid significant liability 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with limits in the amount of million per occurrence and million in the annual aggregate 
our coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at an acceptable cost  if at all 
a product liability claim  product recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price may fluctuate in accordance with market conditions the stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the following events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly o technological innovations applicable to our products  o our attainment of or failure to attain milestones in the commercialization of our technology  o our development of new products or the development of new products by our competitors  o new patents or changes in existing patents applicable to our products  o our acquisition of new businesses or the sale or disposal of a part of our businesses  o development of new collaborative arrangements by us  our competitors or other parties  o changes in government regulations applicable to our business  o changes in investor perception of our business  o fluctuations in our operating results and o changes in the general market conditions in our industry 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we are continuing to implement a new information system at apio  and problems with the design or implementation of this new system could interfere with our operations we are in the process of implementing a new management information and accounting system at apio to replace the old system  which was largely based on legacy systems that were created prior to our acquisition of apio in as a part of this effort  we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage our business operations 
we may not be successful in implementing these new systems and transitioning data 
although we believe that we have identified  to a large extent  the problems associated with the implementation and that the system is stable  problems could arise that we have not foreseen 
during  we expect to complete the implementation of the new system 
if disruptions occur in the implementation and functionality in  our operations could be interrupted 
such disruptions could adversely impact apio s ability to do the following in a timely manner provide quotes  take customer orders  ship products  provide services and support to our customers  bill and track our customers  fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise run apio s business 
in addition  the disruption caused by the implementation of such a system could prevent apio from accumulating  recording  summarizing  processing and reporting the information to be disclosed by landec in its periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission in a timely manner 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price could be adversely affected 
since we order cartons for our products from suppliers in advance of receipt of customer orders for such products  we could face a material inventory risk as part of our inventory planning  we enter into negotiated orders with vendors of cartons used for packing our products in advance of receiving customer orders for such products 
accordingly  we face the risk of ordering too many cartons since orders are generally based on forecasts of customer orders rather than actual orders 
if we cannot change or be released from the orders  we may incur costs as a result of inadequately predicting cartons orders in advance of customer orders 
because of this we may currently have an oversupply of cartons and face the risk of not being able to sell such inventory and our anticipated reserves for losses may be adequate if we have misjudged the demand for our products 
our business and operating results could be adversely affected as a result of these increased costs 
our seed products may fail to germinate properly and we may be subject to claims for reimbursement or damages for losses from customers who use such products farmers plant seed products sold by landec ag with the expectation that they will germinate under normal growing conditions 
if our seed products do not germinate at the appropriate time or fail to germinate at all  our customers may incur significant crop losses and seek reimbursement or bring claims against us for such damages 
although insurance is generally available to cover such claims  the costs for premiums of such policies are prohibitively expensive and we currently do not maintain such insurance 
any claims brought for failure of our seed products to properly germinate could materially and adversely effect our operating and financial results 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs the sarbanes oxley act of the act that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
the act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects 
in addition to final rules and rules already made  nasdaq has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies  such as landec  that are listed on the nasdaq 
we expect these developments to increase our legal and financial compliance costs 
we expect these changes to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members for our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result of the act 
our controlling shareholders exert significant influence over corporate events that may conflict with the interests of other shareholders our executive officers and directors and their affiliates own or control approximately of our common stock assuming conversion of outstanding preferred stock and including options exercisable within days 
accordingly  these officers  directors and shareholders may have the ability to exert significant influence over the election of our board of directors  the approval of amendments to our articles and bylaws and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions requiring shareholder approval 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger or other business combination transaction  even if the transaction or amendments would be beneficial to our other shareholders 
in addition  our controlling shareholders may approve amendments to our articles or bylaws to implement anti takeover or management friendly provisions that may not be beneficial to our other shareholders 
terrorist attacks and risk of contamination may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
the september terrorist attacks in the united states  as well as future events occurring in response or connection to them  including  future terrorist attacks against united states targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the united states or its allies  or trade disruptions impacting our domestic suppliers or our customers  may impact our operations and may  among other things  cause decreased sales of our products 
more generally  these events have affected  and are expected to continue to affect  the general economy and customer demand for our products 
while we do not believe that our employees  facilities  or products are a target for terrorists  there is a remote risk that terrorist activities could result in contamination or adulteration of our products 
although we have systems and procedures in place that are designed to prevent contamination and adulteration of our products  a disgruntled employee or third party could introduce an infectious substance into packages of our products  either at our manufacturing plants or during shipment of our products 
were our products to be tampered with  we could experience a material adverse effect in our business  operations and financial condition 
our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the current economic downturn continues any further decline in general economic conditions could result in a reduction in demand for our products 
such decline could harm our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and stock price  and could limit our ability to reach our goals for achieving profitability 
also  in such an environment  pricing pressures could continue  and if we are unable to respond quickly enough this could negatively impact our gross margins 
we may be exposed to employment related claims and costs that could materially adversely affect our business we have been subject in the past  and may be in the future  to claims by employees based on allegations of discrimination  negligence  harassment and inadvertent employment of illegal aliens or unlicensed personnel  and we may be subject to payment of workers compensation claims and other similar claims 
we could incur substantial costs and our management could spend a significant amount of time responding to such complaints or litigation regarding employee claims  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent on our key employees and if one or more of them were to leave  we could experience difficulties in replacing them and our operating results could suffer the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of a relatively small number of key senior management  technical  sales  and marketing personnel 
the loss of any of our key personnel would likely harm our business 
in addition  competition for senior level personnel with knowledge and experience in our different lines of business is intense 
if any of our key personnel were to leave we would need to devote substantial resources and management attention to replace them 
as a result  management attention may be diverted from managing our business  and we may need to pay higher compensation to replace these employees 
we may issue preferred stock with preferential rights that could affect your rights our board of directors has the authority  without further approval of our shareholders  to fix the rights and preferences  and to issue shares  of preferred stock 
in november  we issued and sold shares of series a convertible preferred stock and in october we issued and sold shares of series b convertible preferred stock 
the series a convertible preferred stock was converted into  shares of common stock on november  each share of series b convertible preferred stock is convertible into shares of common stock in accordance with the conversion formula provided in our articles of incorporation currently a ratio and is entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such shares could be converted 
holders of series b convertible preferred stock have the following preferential rights over holders of common stock o dividend preference holders of series b convertible preferred stock are entitled to cumulative dividends payable in additional shares of series b convertible preferred stock at an annual rate of eight percent for the first two years  ten percent for the third year and twelve percent thereafter  following the initial sale on october  of shares of series b convertible preferred stock 
o liquidation preference upon liquidation of the company  holders of series b convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive  in preference to the holders of common stock  an amount equal to the original issue price of their shares plus any declared or accrued but unpaid dividends 
the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock  and the holders of such preferred stock could have voting  dividend  liquidation and other rights superior to those of holders of our common stock 
we have never paid any dividends on our common stock we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since inception and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
any dividends will be subject to the preferential dividends payable on our outstanding series b preferred stock and dividends payable on any other preferred stock we may issue 
the reporting of our profitability could be materially and adversely affected if it is determined that the book value of goodwill is higher than fair value our balance sheet includes an amount designated as goodwill that represents a portion of our assets and our stockholders equity 
goodwill arises when an acquirer pays more for a business than the fair value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets 
under a newly issued accounting pronouncement  statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  beginning in fiscal year  the amortization of goodwill has been replaced with an impairment test which requires that we compare the fair value of goodwill to its book value at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
if we determine at any time in the future that the book value of goodwill is higher than fair value then the difference must be written off  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability
