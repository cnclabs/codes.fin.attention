item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company manages its exposure to changes in short term interest rates  particularly to reduce the impact on floating rate borrowings under its revolving credit facility  by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
these swap agreements involve the receipt of amounts by the company when floating rates exceed fixed rates and the payment of amounts by the company to the counter parties when fixed rates exceed the floating rates in the agreements over their term 
the company accrues the differential as interest rates change  and recognizes it as an adjustment to the floating rate interest expense related to the debt 
the counter parties to these contracts are high credit quality commercial banks  which the company believes minimizes the risk of counter party default  to a large extent 
at september   the company had swap agreements with total notional principal amounts of million  which effectively fixed the interest rate on obligations in the notional amount of million of debt under the million revolving credit facility 
the swap agreements lock in a libor rate ranging from to and have maturities ranging from to falling interest rates and or a flattening of the yield curve will negatively impact the market value of the interest rate swaps 
changes in the valuation of such swap agreements are recorded directly to earnings 
the face value of interest rate swap agreements was a liability of approximately million at september  a adverse change in the interest rates on variable rate obligations would affect pre tax earnings by approximately million 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of june   the company is over hedged because of the refinancing 
the existing interest rate swaps hedged a portion of the previous libor debt 
as a result of the refinancing  the only libor debt the company has is the million revolver credit facility  of which million was outstanding at september  the company will reduce its interest rate swap position as they mature through august because of the current cost to terminate those agreements
