the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the purchase price of million was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date 
since september   interface s results of operations have been included in our consolidated statements of operations

the assessment was performed primarily due to changes in the economy  the overall decline in the industry growth rates  and our lower actual and projected operating results including that of the business acquired from interface 
our assessment was supported by the significant sustained decline in our stock price since the valuation date of the shares issued in the interface acquisition  which resulted in the net book value of our assets prior to the impairment charge significantly exceeding our market capitalization 
as a result of our review  we recorded a million impairment charge to reduce goodwill and other intangible assets 
the charge was determined based upon our estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining estimated useful life of the goodwill using a discount rate of 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows including the discount rate were determined using our estimates as of march  the remaining intangible assets were amortized in full over their remaining useful life in in january  tumbleweed s board of directors approved a restructuring program

the purchases are made at current market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market and are funded using our working capital 
the repurchase program extends over a twelve month period and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
in october  we adopted a b plan  which allows us to repurchase our stock under our repurchase program during a period in which we are in possession of material non public information  provided we previously communicated repurchase instructions to our broker at a time when we were not in possession of such material non public information 
the b plan does not increase the aggregate million amount authorized for repurchase purposes 
during the year ended december  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for  tumbleweed s future net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by limitations on our ability to apply net operating losses for federal income tax reporting purposes against taxable income in future periods  including limitations due to ownership changes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code  arising from issuance of stock 
recent development on february   tumbleweed announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement with valicert  inc  or valicert

years ended december  and revenue 
revenue  which consists of both product and intellectual property  or ip  revenue as well as services revenue  results from new contracts and backlog 
we define backlog as deferred revenue  contractual commitments that are not due and payable as of the balance sheet date  or collectibility is in doubt  and or for whom the product or service has not yet been delivered 
product and ip revenue consists of license and transaction fees  patent license agreement fees  and the sale of distribution rights 
services revenue includes support and maintenance  consulting  and training fees 
total revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in revenue was due to decreases in revenue from our international regions in europe and asia  which decreased to million from million and to million from million  respectively 
the decrease in revenue in europe and asia was due to the tight discretionary spending of our international installed customer base which led to limited product expansion and maintenance and support revenues within that customer base 
as a result  we decided to transition from direct sales operations to indirect sales operations in europe and japan 
as we identified and developed partners for indirect sales  we experienced a further decline in revenue from europe and asia in revenue from those regions could decrease on a year over year basis in future years due to the indirect sales operations transition 
product and ip revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in product and ip revenue was due to a decrease in product revenue from our international regions in europe and asia  which decreased to million from million and to million from million  respectively 
the decrease was due to our decision to transition to an indirect sales operations model in europe and japan due to sustained declines in the operating results of those regions 
the decrease in international product revenue was partially offset by an increase in revenue of million  to more than million in  from licensing our ip 
table of contents to third parties 
during  we began shifting from a transaction based model to a perpetual license model

as part of this transition  many of our former transaction based customers are purchasing perpetual licenses and associated support and maintenance contracts 
service revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in service revenue was due to our shift in consulting services towards supporting our customer implementations of our product and away from a more generalized secure messaging consulting practice 
this transition resulted in the reduction in the number of revenue generating projects and revenue generating consultants 
as a result  our consulting revenue decreased to million in from million in we expect consulting revenue to decline in fiscal year as we continue this transition 
this decrease in consulting revenue in was partially offset by an increase in maintenance revenue to million in from million in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue is comprised of product license costs and service costs 
product license cost is primarily comprised of royalties paid to third parties for software licensed by us for inclusion in our products 
service costs are comprised primarily of personnel and overhead costs related to customer support and consulting and contract development projects with third parties 
total cost of revenue decreased to million  or of revenue  in from million  or of revenue  in the decrease in product cost is due to the decrease in product revenues that require us to pay third party royalty fees 
the decrease in cost of services revenue  as a percentage of revenue  was due to a shift in our services revenue mix to higher margin support and maintenance revenue from lower margin consulting revenue 
the decrease in cost of services revenue  in absolute dollars  was primarily due to a decrease in employees and related employee costs 
the decrease in employees was driven by our increased focus regarding the direct implementation and development of our core products  and the transition from direct sales operations to indirect sales operations in europe and japan which reduced our professional services headcount in those regions to zero 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses are comprised of engineering and other related personnel costs  the development of our applications  quality assurance  and testing 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to a decrease of employees and related employee costs  including the elimination of bonuses and salary reductions  and a decrease in depreciation expense due to assets becoming fully depreciated  lower capital expenditures as compared to and  and a reduction in allocated overhead charges 
the decrease of employees is due to our decision to reduce the number of our product offerings and outsource development for non core product offerings 
overhead charges were reduced due to our reduction in information technology spending and our reduction in facilities costs 
we believe that our investment in research and development is required to remain competitive and therefore expect to maintain resource levels consistent with the last quarter of in addition  we are focused on controlling costs throughout our company 
as part of this effort  we are outsourcing development for those non core products for which we can reduce costs and meet delivery requirements 
we have also reduced the information technology and facilities costs required to support the same levels of resources 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses are comprised of salaries  commissions  travel expenses  other related personnel costs  and costs associated with marketing programs

the lower bad debt expense resulted from a decrease in the size of our accounts receivable balance  increased collections efforts and more centralized operations in the united states  and improved geographic and industry mix of our customers 
overhead charges were reduced due to our reduction in information technology spending and our reduction in facilities costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in due to increased expense related to intellectual property licensing  enforcement and development and increased public company expenses

sfas nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability be recognized for those costs only when the liability is incurred  that is  when it meets the definition of a liability in the fasb s conceptual framework 
in contrast  under eitf issue  a company recognized a liability for an exit cost when it committed to an exit plan 
sfas also established fair value as the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas as of january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
we are required to adopt the provisions of eitf as of january  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which clarifies disclosure and recognition measurement requirements related to certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after december  and the recognition measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  we adopted the disclosure requirements of fin effective december  and we do not expect the adoption of the recognition measurement requirements of fin to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas and apb opinion  interim financial reporting  to require disclosure of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
while sfas does not amend sfas to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas or the intrinsic value method of apb opinion as allowed by sfas  we have elected to continue to utilize the accounting method prescribed by apb opinion and have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas and sfas as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates tumbleweed s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon tumbleweed s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to 
table of contents make estimates and judgments in determining the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  customer arrangements  collectibility of accounts receivable  valuation of assets  and contingencies and litigation 
when making estimates  we consider our historical experience  our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
tumbleweed believes that the following critical accounting policies represent areas where significant judgments and estimates have been used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition tumbleweed derives its revenue from two sources i product and intellectual property  or ip  revenue  which includes license and transaction fees  patent license agreement fees  the sale of distribution rights  and hosting arrangements  and ii services revenue  which includes support and maintenance  consulting  and training fees 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
tumbleweed typically offers its software products under a perpetual license model 
in addition  we offer or have offered our products under a transaction based model  under which fees were based on the volume of transactions or contractual minimum volumes  patent license agreements  whereby licensees gain access to one or more of our patents for the duration of the patent s in exchange for a licensing and or transaction fee  distribution rights  and hosting arrangements which require customers to pay a one time fee for the right to use our software and services over a limited time 
tumbleweed applies the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements  which generally requires revenue recognized from software arrangements to be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair values of the elements  such as software products  consulting  training  installation  or post contract customer support 
fair values are based upon vendor specific objective evidence 
if such evidence does not exist for delivered elements  we record revenue using the residual method 
if such evidence does not exist for undelivered elements  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist  or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered  or revenue is recorded ratably if the only undelivered element is support and maintenance 
tumbleweed recognizes revenue from perpetual licenses upon shipment when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  based on an executed contract and non binding purchase order  the product has been delivered  generally to a common carrier or by electronic distribution  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
transaction revenue is recognized based on payment schedules or transaction reports from tumbleweed s customers 
a number of our contracts include minimum transaction volume requirements 
in these cases  the minimum guaranteed revenue is recognized when fees are due and payable during those months where transaction volume does not exceed the designated minimums 
tumbleweed recognizes revenue from patent license agreements and from the sale of distribution rights when i the patent license or distribution agreement is executed  ii the amounts due are fixed  determinable  and billable  and iii collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
hosting arrangements require customers to pay a one time fee for the right to use tumbleweed software and services 
we recognize revenue from hosting arrangements ratably over the service period because the customer 
table of contents does not have the right to take the software 
we discontinued our hosting effort during the three months ended september  customers generally purchase at least one year of support and maintenance together with each perpetual license 
support and maintenance is sold as a percentage of the list price of the software product 
renewals of support and maintenance in future years are also sold as a percentage of the software product s list price 
under a support and maintenance agreement  customers receive on going support and  in some instances  the right to receive future updates and upgrades of our products during the term of the agreement 
revenue from support and maintenance is recognized ratably over the period the support is provided 
installation by tumbleweed of our products is not considered essential to the functionality of our products  as these services do not alter the products capabilities  do not require any specialized skills  and may be performed by the customer or any third parties 
services revenue is related to installation and is generally recognized on a time and materials basis  except for when specific acceptance criteria exists 
when customer specific acceptance criteria exist  we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance 
when licenses are sold together with consulting services  license fees are recognized upon delivery  provided that the revenue recognition criteria set forth above for perpetual licenses have been met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the consulting and implementation services  and the services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
for arrangements that do not meet the above criteria  both the product license revenues and services revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion contract method in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
other consulting engagements are generally on a time and materials basis  for which revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
for fixed dollar consulting contracts with milestones or acceptance provisions  revenue is recognized upon completion of a milestone or acceptance  if applicable 
training revenue is recognized as the training is provided 
tumbleweed assesses collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue upon receipt of cash 
for contracts with extended payment terms  we recognize revenue as payments become due from the customer 
revenue from the reseller channel is recognized upon software shipment  the execution of a distribution agreement with the reseller  and the receipt of substantive identification of the end user customer 
valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts tumbleweed maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
we must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable  including review of historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  aging of the balance and estimated collectibility percentages for different aging ranges  geographic and industry mix  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was and of our gross receivables as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents valuation of privately held investments tumbleweed s determination of impairment related to certain equity investments in privately held companies is based on the latest available valuation of such investment  or  if unavailable  our assumptions related to projected operating results of the privately held company and potential effects of declines in market trends 
future events that adversely change the assumptions we use to determine valuation of investments may require us to record charges for impairment of the carrying value of our investments 
during  tumbleweed made investments in two non publicly traded companies of  and million 
the investments were carried at cost as we hold less than of the voting equity and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence 
the investments were included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet at december  and we monitored these investments for impairment and made appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary 
we recorded expenses of  and million in and  respectively  to recognize an other than temporary impairment in the value of these investments 
as of december  we had no remaining assets on our balance sheet relating to these investments 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill tumbleweed assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when tumbleweed determines that the carrying value of long lived assets  and goodwill prior to the adoption of sfas  may not be recoverable upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  and such carrying value is less than projected undiscounted cash flows attributed to the asset  we measure any impairment based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
sfas became effective on january  and as a result  tumbleweed ceased amortizing approximately million of goodwill 
in connection with sfas s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  tumbleweed assessed whether there was an indication that goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisition of tumbleweed communications kk was impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we determined the carrying value of our reporting unit by assigning our assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to our reporting unit as of the date of adoption 
as our tumbleweed communications kk reporting unit s carrying amount exceeded its fair value  indicating that tumbleweed communications kk s goodwill might be impaired  we performed the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we compared the implied fair value of tumbleweed communications kk s goodwill  determined by allocating tumbleweed communications kk s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities to its carrying amount  both of which were measured as of the date of adoption 
a transitional impairment loss of  was recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations 
during the six months ended june   tumbleweed communications kk experienced a sustained decline in operations 
as a result  we revaluated our future prospects in japan and decided to transition to an 
table of contents indirect sales distribution model in japan 
as of june   we determined that our goodwill was impaired and wrote off the million remainder of the goodwill balance 
during the three months ended september   we began the liquidation of tumbleweed communications kk 
as a result of the liquidation of tumbleweed communications kk  during the three months ended september   we recorded an operating expense of  related to the write off of the remaining net assets of tumbleweed communications kk and our eighty percent equity position in tumbleweed communications kk 
tumbleweed communications kk ceased operations in august and formally declared bankruptcy in december risks and uncertainties tumbleweed has a history of losses and may experience continued losses 
tumbleweed s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses  delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies engaged in new and rapidly evolving technology markets like tumbleweed s 
tumbleweed incurred net losses of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
as of december   tumbleweed had incurred cumulative net losses of million 
tumbleweed s success may depend in large part upon increased adoption and utilization of tumbleweed s products and technology  as well as tumbleweed s ability to effectively maintain existing relationships and develop new relationships with customers and strategic partners 
if tumbleweed does not succeed  it may not achieve or maintain profitability on a timely basis or at all 
in particular  tumbleweed intends to expend significant financial and management resources on product development  sales and marketing  strategic relationships  technology and operating infrastructure 
as a result  tumbleweed may incur additional losses and continued negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
tumbleweed s quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations 
tumbleweed s revenue has fluctuated and tumbleweed s quarterly operating results will continue to fluctuate based on the timing of the execution and termination of customer agreements in a given quarter 
tumbleweed s ability to receive revenue from services is subject to multiple risks  including the risk that tumbleweed may not be able to meet increasing customer demand because of a lack of adequately trained personnel  and the risk that customers may not timely accept the services provided and delay payment for such services 
in addition  tumbleweed has experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in revenue and operating results from quarter to quarter for other reasons  including  but not limited to the substantial decrease in information technology spending in general  and among tumbleweed s target customers in particular  customers choosing to delay their purchase commitments or purchase in smaller amounts than expected due to a general downturn in the economy  tumbleweed s ability to continue to license its patents  the timing of such licenses  and the costs necessary to defend its patents  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to tumbleweed s business  operations and infrastructure  including its international operations  tumbleweed s ability to accurately estimate and control costs  tumbleweed s ability to timely collect fees owed by customers  the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products and services in the secure content management  content security  secure online communications  or document delivery markets  and acquisitions that tumbleweed completes or proposes 

table of contents as a result of these factors  tumbleweed believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that these comparisons may not be accurate indicators of future performance 
tumbleweed may not be able to accurately forecast its revenue or expenses 
because tumbleweed s staffing and operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels  and because a high percentage of tumbleweed s costs are fixed  small variations in the timing of the recognition of specific revenue could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  many of tumbleweed s customers delay purchases of tumbleweed s products until the end of each quarter 
if tumbleweed is unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  any significant revenue shortfall would likely have an immediate negative effect on tumbleweed s operating results 
moreover  tumbleweed believes the difficulties outlined above with respect to financial forecasts also apply to securities analysts that may publish estimates of tumbleweed s financial results 
tumbleweed s operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors due to any of a wide variety of factors  including fluctuations in financial ratios or other metrics used to measure tumbleweed s performance 
if this occurs  tumbleweed would expect to experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of tumbleweed s stock 
economic conditions could adversely affect tumbleweed s revenue growth 
the revenue growth and profitability of tumbleweed s business depends on the overall demand for tumbleweed s products  tumbleweed s intellectual property  and tumbleweed s services  particularly within the industries in which tumbleweed offers specific versions of tumbleweed s products 
because tumbleweed s sales are primarily to customers in the financial services  health care  and government industries  tumbleweed s business depends on the overall economic conditions and the economic and business conditions within these industries 
the progressive weakening of the global economy  the information technology industry in particular  and the weakening of the business conditions within the above industries has caused a decrease in tumbleweed s license revenues 
a softening of demand for information technology spending caused by a continued weakening of the economy  domestically or internationally  may result in a continued decrease in revenues 
in addition  the financial  political  economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the united states have led to a further weakening of the global economy  and have created an uncertain economic environment 
tumbleweed cannot predict the impact of these events  any subsequent terrorist acts or of any related military action  on tumbleweed s customers or business 
subsequent terrorist acts and or the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the united states or other countries could adversely affect spending on information technology and on tumbleweed s software license revenue  as well as have an adverse effect on tumbleweed s business  financial condition or results of operations 
tumbleweed may have insufficient cash reserves to see it through to profitability 
as of december   tumbleweed had cash and cash equivalents of million and had incurred cumulative net losses since inception of million 
tumbleweed s current cash reserves  especially in light of tumbleweed s million stock repurchase program authorized in august of  may be insufficient if tumbleweed experiences either lower than expected revenues or extraordinary or unexpected cash expenses 
as a result  tumbleweed may be required to raise funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships  or other arrangements 
funding  if needed  however  may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  tumbleweed may be required to curtail significantly or defer one or more of tumbleweed s operating goals or programs  or take other steps that could harm tumbleweed s business 

table of contents failure to obtain needed financing could affect tumbleweed s ability to maintain current operations and pursue future growth  and the terms of any financing tumbleweed obtains may impair the rights of tumbleweed s existing stockholders 
in the future  tumbleweed may be required to seek additional financing to fund its operations 
factors such as the commercial success of tumbleweed s existing products and services  the timing and success of any new products and services  the progress of tumbleweed s research and development efforts  tumbleweed s results of operations  the status of competitive products and services  and the timing and success of potential strategic alliances or potential opportunities to acquire or sell technologies or assets may require us to seek additional funding sooner than tumbleweed expects 
in the event that tumbleweed requires additional cash  tumbleweed may not be able to secure additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us  especially in light of the uncertainty in the current market environment  and tumbleweed may not be successful in implementing or negotiating such other arrangements to improve its cash position 
if tumbleweed raises additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of tumbleweed s stockholders would be reduced and the securities tumbleweed issues might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of tumbleweed s current stockholders 
if adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms  tumbleweed s ability to achieve or sustain positive cash flows  maintain current operations  fund any potential expansion  take advantage of new opportunities  develop or enhance products or services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited 
a limited number of customers account for a high percentage of tumbleweed s revenue  and the failure to maintain or expand these relationships could harm tumbleweed s business 
the loss of one or more of tumbleweed s major customers  the failure to attract new customers on a timely basis or a reduction in usage and revenue associated with the existing or proposed customers would harm tumbleweed s business and prospects 
for   and  five customers comprised approximately   and  respectively  of tumbleweed s revenue 
for   and  respectively  no single customer comprised or more of tumbleweed s revenue 
tumbleweed faces risks in investing in and integrating new acquisitions  including tumbleweed s proposed acquisition of valicert 
tumbleweed is continuously evaluating investments in complementary technologies and businesses 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  or products  including tumbleweed s acquisition of valicert  entail numerous risks  including potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from integration  diversion of management s attention  loss of key employees of acquired operations  coordinating sales and pricing efforts to effectively communicate the value and capabilities of the combined company  the difficulty of assimilating geographically dispersed operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of tumbleweed s ongoing business  unanticipated expenses related to such integration  the correct assessment of the relative percentages of in process research and development expense that can be immediately written off as compared to the amount which must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset  
table of contents the impairment of relationships with employees and customers of either an acquired company or tumbleweed s business  the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired business  and inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities 
as a result of acquisitions  tumbleweed may acquire significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions 
changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets 
any such problems in integration or adjustments to the value of the assets acquired could harm tumbleweed s growth strategy and have a material adverse effect on tumbleweed s business and financial condition 
tumbleweed faces technical  operational and strategic challenges that may prevent it from successfully integrating the proposed acquisition of valicert  or any other company tumbleweed may acquire 
the integration of the valicert business  including its technology  operations and personnel  will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process that may disrupt tumbleweed s business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
additionally  the integration of any other company or business tumbleweed may acquire in the future may be a complex  time consuming and expensive process that may disrupt tumbleweed s business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
whenever an acquisition is completed  tumbleweed must operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices 
tumbleweed may encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays involved in integrating the operations of valicert  or any other company  including potential incompatibility of business cultures  perceived adverse changes in business focus  potential conflicts in customer  advertising or strategic relationships  potential failure to complete anticipated sales  and the loss of key employees and diversion of the attention of management from other ongoing business concerns 
as a result  tumbleweed may not be successful in integrating valicert or any other business or technologies tumbleweed acquires and may not achieve anticipated revenue and costs benefits 
tumbleweed also cannot guarantee that these acquisitions will result in sufficient revenues or earnings to justify tumbleweed s investment in  or expenses related to  the acquisition 
nor can tumbleweed guarantee that any anticipated synergies will develop 
if tumbleweed fails to execute its acquisition strategy successfully for any reason  tumbleweed s business will suffer 
if tumbleweed does not secure key relationships with enterprise customers  tumbleweed s access to broader markets will be limited 
tumbleweed s enterprise customers  which use or intend to use tumbleweed s products to intelligently manage the incoming and outgoing online communications of their enterprises  are a significant source of tumbleweed s revenue 
a key aspect of tumbleweed s strategy is to access target markets prior to adoption of alternative solutions by the larger participants in these markets 
the failure to secure key relationships with new enterprise customers in targeted markets could limit or effectively preclude tumbleweed s entry into these target markets  which would harm tumbleweed s business and prospects 

table of contents customers in a preliminary phase of implementing tumbleweed s product may not proceed on a timely basis or at all 
some of tumbleweed s customers are currently in a pre production or pre launch stage of implementing tumbleweed s products and may encounter delays or other problems in introducing them 
a customer s decision not to do so or a delay in implementation could result in a delay or loss in related revenue or otherwise harm tumbleweed s businesses and prospects 
tumbleweed cannot predict when any customer that is currently in a pilot or preliminary phase will implement broader use of tumbleweed s services 
the markets for secure messaging applications generally  and for tumbleweed s products specifically  are new and may not develop 
the market for tumbleweed s products and services is new and evolving rapidly 
if the market for tumbleweed s products and services fails to develop and grow  or if tumbleweed s products and services do not gain broad market acceptance  tumbleweed s business and prospects will be harmed 
in particular  tumbleweed s success will depend upon the adoption and use by current and potential customers and their end users of secure messaging applications 
tumbleweed s success will also depend upon acceptance of tumbleweed s technology as the standard for providing these services 
the adoption and use of tumbleweed s products and services will involve changes in the manner in which businesses have traditionally exchanged information 
in some cases  tumbleweed s customers have little experience with products  services and technology like those offered by us 
tumbleweed s ability to influence usage of its products and services by customers and end users is limited 
for example  the usage of secure messenger by the end users of tumbleweed s service provider customers has been limited to date 
tumbleweed has spent  and intend to continue to spend  considerable resources educating potential customers and their end users about the value of tumbleweed s products and services 
it is difficult to assess  or to predict with any assurance  the present and future size of the potential market for tumbleweed s products and services  or tumbleweed s growth rate  if any 
moreover  tumbleweed cannot predict whether tumbleweed s products and services will achieve any market acceptance 
for example  as email has become increasingly widespread and accepted  current and potential customers may be more willing to accept related security risks with email  as opposed to utilizing tumbleweed s products 
tumbleweed s ability to achieve its goals also depends upon rapid market acceptance of future enhancements of tumbleweed s products and tumbleweed s ability to identify new markets as they emerge 
any enhancement that is not favorably received by customers and end users may not be profitable and  furthermore  could damage tumbleweed s reputation or brand name 
any failure to identify and address new market opportunities could harm tumbleweed s business and prospects 
the markets tumbleweed addresses are highly competitive and rapidly changing  and tumbleweed may not be able to compete successfully 
tumbleweed may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and the multiple competitive pressures tumbleweed faces could harm tumbleweed s business and prospects 
the markets in which tumbleweed competes are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
the principal competitive factors in tumbleweed s industry include price  product functionality  product integration  platform coverage and ability to scale  worldwide sales infrastructure and global technical support 
some of tumbleweed s competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources than tumbleweed does  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base 
additionally  some of these competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with product lines tumbleweed markets and distributes 
tumbleweed expects that the market for secure messaging applications will become more consolidated with larger companies being better positioned to compete in such an environment in the long term 
as this market continues to develop  
table of contents a number of companies with greater resources than ours could attempt to increase their presence in this market by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with tumbleweed s competitors or business partners 
tumbleweed s success will depend on its ability to adapt to these competing forces  to develop more advanced products more rapidly and less expensively than tumbleweed s competitors  and to educate potential customers as to the benefits of licensing tumbleweed s products rather than developing their own products 
competitors could introduce products with superior features  scalability and functionality at lower prices than tumbleweed s products and could also bundle existing or new products with other more established products in order to compete with us 
in addition  because there are relatively low barriers to entry for the software market  tumbleweed expects additional competition from other established and emerging companies 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm tumbleweed s business 
changing tumbleweed s sales distribution model from direct sales operations to indirect sales operations in europe and japan may reduce tumbleweed s revenue in future periods 
during  tumbleweed transitioned from direct sales operations to indirect sales operations in europe and japan due to sustained declines in the operating results of those regions 
in europe  tumbleweed is winding down its direct sales operations and has signed a reseller agreement with a distributor to sell tumbleweed s products and provide technical support to tumbleweed s customers there 
in japan  tumbleweed transitioned to an indirect sales distribution model and began the liquidation of its majority owned subsidiary in japan  tumbleweed communications kk 
tumbleweed communications kk ceased operations in august and formally declared bankruptcy in december revenue from tumbleweed s international regions in europe and asia may decrease on a year over year basis in future years as a result of this transition 
restructuring of operations and other cost reducing measures tumbleweed has implemented may not achieve the results tumbleweed intends and even may harm tumbleweed s business 
in january  tumbleweed announced a restructuring of its business  which included a reduction in force and the closure of three international locations 
since that time tumbleweed has reduced its work force from more than employees to approximately employees and has engaged in other ongoing measures to reduce expenses and establish an enterprise that is appropriate for tumbleweed s expected revenue levels 
the planning and implementation of these efforts have placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on tumbleweed s managerial  operational  financial and other resources 
additionally  the actions undertaken to restructure the business may negatively affect tumbleweed s revenue stream  customer satisfaction  employee turnover  recruiting and retention of important employees 
if tumbleweed experiences difficulties in carrying out the restructuring  tumbleweed s expenses could increase more quickly than tumbleweed expects 
if tumbleweed finds that the actions taken to date did not sufficiently decrease tumbleweed s expenses  tumbleweed may find it necessary to implement further streamlining of tumbleweed s expenses  to perform additional reductions in tumbleweed s headcount or to undertake additional restructurings of tumbleweed s business 
the restructuring of tumbleweed s business has placed a strain on resources 
the restructuring of tumbleweed s business in has placed and continues to place  a significant strain on managerial  informational  administrative and operational resources 
tumbleweed s current systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to achieve the rapid execution necessary to effectively operate within the market for its products and services 
tumbleweed needs to continue to enhance and improve its managerial capacity  and improve or replace its existing operational  customer service and financial systems  procedures and controls 
any failure to properly manage these systems and procedural transitions could impair tumbleweed s ability to attract and service customers  and could cause us to incur higher operating costs and delays in the execution of its business plan 
despite its restructuring  tumbleweed expects that it may need to expand elements of its employee base on a selective basis 
tumbleweed s management may not be able to hire  
table of contents train  retain  motivate and manage required personnel 
in addition  tumbleweed s management may not be able to successfully identify  manage and exploit existing and potential market opportunities 
if tumbleweed cannot manage its operations effectively  tumbleweed s business and operating results could suffer 
finally  tumbleweed may have operational  customer service and financial systems that are not appropriate for tumbleweed s current estimated size 
moving to more appropriate office systems may also place a strain on tumbleweed s current systems and require financial expenditures to end the commitments on other systems 
tumbleweed has converted to a new financial system 
in october  tumbleweed converted to a new financial system 
as a result of this change  tumbleweed may have difficulties retrieving historical financial information due to a lack of connectivity between its previous financial system and its new financial system 
tumbleweed s new financial system is less complex than its previous financial system which may have a negative impact on its internal controls 
tumbleweed has a lengthy sales and implementation cycle which could harm its business 
if tumbleweed is unable to license its services to new customers on a timely basis or if its existing and proposed customers and their end users suffer delays in the implementation and adoption of its services  tumbleweed s revenue may be limited and business and prospects may be harmed 
tumbleweed s customers must evaluate its technology and integrate its products and services into the products and services they provide 
in addition  tumbleweed s customers may need to adopt a comprehensive sales  marketing and training program in order to effectively implement some of its products 
finally  tumbleweed must coordinate with its customers using its product for third party communications in order to assist end users in the adoption of tumbleweed s products 
for these and other reasons  the cycle associated with establishing licenses and implementing tumbleweed s products can be lengthy 
this cycle is also subject to a number of significant delays over which tumbleweed has little or no control 
forecasts about license revenue may be inaccurate as a result of any or all of these factors  and inaccurate forecasts may cause tumbleweed s business  or market valuation  to suffer 
a failure to protect tumbleweed s intellectual property may significantly harm its business 
tumbleweed currently relies on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks and licenses  together with non disclosure and confidentiality agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products 
tumbleweed holds certain patent rights with respect to some of its products 
tumbleweed has filed  and expect in the future to file  additional patent applications 
tumbleweed s existing patents or trademarks  as well as any future patents or trademarks obtained by tumbleweed  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or tumbleweed s competitors may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to its technology 
further patent or trademark protection may not be obtained  in the united states or elsewhere  for tumbleweed s existing or new products  applications or services 
in addition  further protection  if obtained  may not be effective 
in some countries  meaningful patent or trademark protection is not available 
third parties could assert infringement claims against tumbleweed in the future  and the cost of responding to such assertions  regardless of their validity  could be significant 
tumbleweed may increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of its competitors grows and the functionality of their products and services increasingly overlap with tumbleweed s 
tumbleweed aggressively seeks to enforce its patent and other intellectual property rights 
the enforcement process may be costly and require significant management attention 
in addition  tumbleweed s enforcement of its patent and other intellectual property rights may increase the risk of adverse claims  with or without merit  which could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  limit use of tumbleweed s services or require tumbleweed to enter into royalty or license agreements 
in addition  such claims may be found to be valid and could result in awards against tumbleweed  which could harm tumbleweed s business 

table of contents tumbleweed also relies  to some extent  on unpatented trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information 
tumbleweed s policy is to have employees sign confidentiality agreements  to have selected parties sign non competition agreements and to have third parties sign non disclosure agreements 
although tumbleweed takes precautionary measures to maintain its unpatented proprietary information  others may acquire equivalent information or otherwise gain access to or disclose tumbleweed s proprietary information and tumbleweed may be unable to meaningfully protect its rights to its proprietary information 
in september  tumbleweed received a letter from entrust  inc indicating that tumbleweed may be interested in licensing the technology covered by us patent no 
 encryption and decryption system and method with content analysis provision  issued to entrust 
in october  tumbleweed sent a letter to entrust indicating that entrust may be interested in licensing the technology covered by four patents issued to tumbleweed  namely  us patent nos 
 method system for dynamic server document encryption   distributed dynamic document conversion server   method apparatus for effecting secure document format conversion  and  method apparatus for effecting secure document format conversion 
in february  tumbleweed received a letter from entrust indicating that tumbleweed may have an interest in three additional patents issued to entrust us patent nos 
 method and apparatus for access to user specific encryption information   access and storage of secure group communication cryptographic keys  and  method and apparatus for secure group communication 
tumbleweed believes it does not infringe any valid entrust patent 
if tumbleweed were to conclude based on additional information that some element of its processes are or might be covered by any of these entrust patents  tumbleweed might seek to negotiate and obtain a license from entrust 
if tumbleweed were unwilling or unable to obtain a license from entrust  tumbleweed would remain subject to potential liability for patent infringement 
although tumbleweed will contest any lawsuit by entrust vigorously  tumbleweed cannot make assurances that tumbleweed will prevail if entrust were to sue it for infringement of any of these entrust patents 
if any portions of tumbleweed s products were found to be infringing on these patents  then tumbleweed would likely be unable to continue to offer those portions of its products found to be infringing 
tumbleweed could also then be required to pay damages for past infringing use  possibly attorneys fees  and possibly treble damages 
this could have a material adverse effect on tumbleweed s business prospects  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
if tumbleweed does not provide adequate support services to its customers to implement its products  tumbleweed s business may suffer 
tumbleweed s professional services organization assists its customers in implementing its products through software installation  integration with existing customer systems  contract engineering  consulting and training 
if the professional services organization does not adequately assess customer requirements or address technical problems  customers may seek to discontinue their relationships with us due to dissatisfaction with the product or tumbleweed s customer support 
furthermore  these customers may realize lower usage than they could have otherwise achieved because they did not fully capitalize on the product in ways that could have been addressed by tumbleweed s professional services organization 
tumbleweed s products must be integrated with existing hardware and complex software products of its customers or other third parties  and its customers may not have significant experience with the implementation of products similar to tumbleweed s own 
in addition  profitably providing contract engineering and integration services is an increasingly important aspect of tumbleweed s strategy to strengthen customer loyalty to its product and company 
therefore  tumbleweed s business and future prospects significantly depend on the strength of its professional services organization and its ability to leverage this organization by augmenting its reach through trained and qualified systems integrators 
if tumbleweed s professional services organization does not adequately meet these multiple challenges  its business and prospects could suffer 

table of contents product performance problems  system failures  and internet problems could severely damage tumbleweed s business 
the ability of tumbleweed s customers to use its services depends on stable product performance  and the efficient and uninterrupted operation of the computer and communications hardware as well as the software and internet network systems that they maintain 
although tumbleweed s ability to manage the effects of system failures which occur in computer hardware  software and network systems is limited  the occurrences of these failures could harm tumbleweed s reputation  business and prospects 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of tumbleweed s infrastructure  and the internet could face similar outages and delays in the future 
in addition  an increasing number of tumbleweed s customers require us to provide computer and communications hardware  software and internet networking systems to them as an outsourced data center service 
all data centers  whether hosted by tumbleweed  its customers or by an independent third party to which it outsources this function  are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure or other similar events 
if tumbleweed s software contains errors  tumbleweed may lose customers or experience reduced market acceptance of its products 
tumbleweed s software products are inherently complex and may contain defects and errors that are detected only when the products are in use 
in addition  some of tumbleweed s customers require or may require enhanced customization of tumbleweed s software for their specific needs  and these modifications may increase the likelihood of undetected defects or errors 
further  tumbleweed often provides implementation  consulting and other technical services  the performance of which typically involves working with sophisticated software  computing and networking systems  and tumbleweed could fail to meet customer expectations as a result of any defects or errors 
as a result  tumbleweed may lose customers  customers may fail to implement tumbleweed s products more broadly within their organization and tumbleweed may experience reduced market acceptance of tumbleweed s products 
some of tumbleweed s products are designed to facilitate the secure transmission of sensitive business information to specified parties outside the business over the internet 
as a result  the reputation of tumbleweed s software products for providing good security is vital to their acceptance by customers 
tumbleweed s products may be vulnerable to break ins  theft or other improper activity that could jeopardize the security of information for which tumbleweed is responsible 
problems caused by product defects  failure to meet project milestones for services or security breaches could result in loss of or delay in revenue  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of research and development resources  harm to tumbleweed s reputation  or increased insurance  service and warranty costs 
to address these problems  tumbleweed may need to expend significant capital resources that may not have been budgeted 
failure to license necessary third party software incorporated in tumbleweed s products could cause delays or reductions in tumbleweed s sales 
tumbleweed licenses third party software that tumbleweed incorporates into its products 
these licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
some of this technology would be difficult to replace 
the loss of any such license could result in delays or reductions of tumbleweed s applications until tumbleweed identifies  license and integrate or develop equivalent software 
if tumbleweed is required to enter into license agreements with third parties for replacement technology  tumbleweed could face higher royalty payments and tumbleweed s products may lose certain attributes or features 
in the future  tumbleweed might need to license other software to enhance its products and meet evolving customer needs 
if tumbleweed is unable to do this  tumbleweed could experience reduced demand for its products 
tumbleweed may be unable to recruit  retain and motivate qualified personnel  which could harm tumbleweed s business  including product development 
tumbleweed must continue to identify  recruit  hire  train  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  sales  marketing and customer service personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  and 
table of contents tumbleweed may not be able to successfully recruit  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
in particular  tumbleweed may encounter difficulties in recruiting a sufficient number of qualified software developers and sales personnel  and tumbleweed may not be able to retain these employees 
the failure to recruit and retain necessary technical  managerial  sales  merchandising  marketing and customer service personnel could harm tumbleweed s business and its ability to obtain new customers and develop new products 
although tumbleweed has used and continue to use stock options as a retention tool  many of tumbleweed s employees hold stock options that are underwater ie  the market price of tumbleweed s stock is below their option exercise price  and these options may be ineffective as a retention tool 
tumbleweed s employee turnover may increase if outstanding stock options continue to remain underwater and tumbleweed does not adjust the option exercise prices 
any adjustment of stock option exercise prices may result in additional stock compensation expense  dilution to tumbleweed s stockholders and depress tumbleweed s stock price 
if tumbleweed loses the services of executive officers or other key employees  tumbleweed s ability to develop its business and secure customer relationships will suffer 
tumbleweed is substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of its executive officers and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of tumbleweed s executive officers or other key employees could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of tumbleweed s development and strategic objectives 
tumbleweed does not have long term employment agreements with any of tumbleweed s key personnel 
the loss of services of any of tumbleweed s executive officers or other key personnel could significantly harm tumbleweed s business and prospects 
tumbleweed s efforts to establish  maintain and strengthen its brands will require significant expenditures and may not be successful 
if the marketplace does not associate tumbleweed s brands with high quality internet communication services  it may be more difficult for us to attract new customers or introduce future products and services 
the market for tumbleweed s services is new 
therefore  tumbleweed s failure to establish brand recognition at this stage could harm its ability to compete in the future with other companies that successfully establish a brand name for their services 
tumbleweed must succeed in its marketing efforts  provide high quality services and increase tumbleweed s user base in order to build its brand awareness and differentiate tumbleweed s products from those of its competitors 
these efforts have required significant expenditures to date 
moreover  tumbleweed believes that these efforts will require substantial commitments of resources in the future as tumbleweed s brands become increasingly important to its overall strategy and as the market for tumbleweed s services grows 
tumbleweed s allowance for doubtful accounts may be insufficient to cover receivables tumbleweed is unable to collect 
tumbleweed assumes a certain level of credit risk with its customers in order to do business 
conditions affecting any of tumbleweed s customers could cause them to become unable or unwilling to pay us in a timely manner  or at all  for products or services tumbleweed has already provided them 
for example  if the current economic conditions continue to decline or if new or unanticipated government regulations are enacted which affect tumbleweed s customers  they may be unable to pay their bills 
in the past  tumbleweed has experienced significant collection delays from certain customers  and tumbleweed cannot predict whether it will continue to experience similar or more severe delays in the future 
in particular  some of tumbleweed s customers are suffering from the general weakness in the economy and among technology companies in particular 
although tumbleweed has established an allowance for doubtful accounts that it believes is sufficient to cover losses due to delays in or inability to pay and while it takes a consistently conservative position on the collectibility of receivables with respect to particular customers  tumbleweed s allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to cover its losses 
if losses due to delays or inability to pay are greater than tumbleweed s allowance 
table of contents for doubtful accounts  tumbleweed would be required to recognize an additional expense for the write off and to increase tumbleweed s allowance for doubtful accounts  which could adversely affect its operating results 
because tumbleweed s products utilize the internet  if use of the internet does not increase  or the architecture of the internet is altered  the level of use of tumbleweed s products will suffer 
if the internet and other products and services necessary for the utilization of tumbleweed s products are not sufficiently developed  fewer customers and end users will use tumbleweed s products and its business will be harmed 
in particular  the success of tumbleweed s products and services will depend on the development and maintenance of adequate internet infrastructure  such as a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and other features demanded by users 
moreover  tumbleweed s success will also depend on the timely development of complementary products or services such as high speed internet connections for providing reliable access and services and this may not occur 
moreover  changes in the architecture of the internet may limit the success of tumbleweed s products 
because the online exchange of information is new and evolving  the internet may not prove to be a viable platform for secure messaging applications in the long term 
the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic 
as the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users and frequency of use  or if its users require increasingly more resources  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it 
as a result  the performance or reliability of the internet may be harmed 
this in turn could decrease the level of internet usage and also the level of utilization of tumbleweed s products and services 
government regulation relating to the internet may increase costs of doing business or require changes in tumbleweed s business model 
tumbleweed is subject to regulations applicable to businesses generally and laws or regulations directly applicable to companies utilizing the internet 
although at present there are relatively few specific laws and regulations directly applicable to the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet 
these laws could cover issues like user privacy  pricing  content  intellectual property  distribution  taxation  antitrust  legal liability and characteristics and quality of products and services 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations could decrease the demand for tumbleweed s products and services and increase tumbleweed s cost of doing business or otherwise harm tumbleweed s business or prospects 
delays in the enactment of expected regulations may result in delayed software purchasing by tumbleweed s customers who are subject to such regulations  which in turn may harm tumbleweed s business 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues like property ownership  sales and other taxes  libel and personal privacy is uncertain and may take years to resolve 
for example  tax authorities in a number of states are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce 
new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes 
any new legislation or regulation  the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to tumbleweed s business  or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and commercial online services could harm tumbleweed s ability to conduct business and harm operating results 
tumbleweed s products are subject to export controls  and tumbleweed may be unable to obtain necessary export approvals 
exports of software products utilizing encryption technology are generally restricted by the us and various foreign governments 
all cryptographic products require export licenses from certain us government agencies 
we have obtained approval to export products using up to bit symmetric encryption and bit public key encryption  including the products formerly named ime server  ime desktop  ime receive applet  ime remote api using omniorb with ssl  mms worldwide and mms strong worldwide we are not 
table of contents exporting other products and services that are subject to export control under us law 
however  the list of products and countries for which export approval is required  and the related regulatory policies  could be revised  and tumbleweed may not be able to obtain necessary approval for the export of future products 
the inability to obtain required approvals under these regulations could limit tumbleweed s ability to make international sales 
furthermore  competitors may also seek to obtain approvals to export products that could increase the amount of competition tumbleweed faces 
additionally  countries outside of the us could impose regulatory restrictions impairing tumbleweed s ability to import its products into those countries 
costs of communicating via the internet could increase if access fees are imposed 
certain local telephone carriers have asserted that the increasing popularity and use of the internet has burdened the existing telecommunications infrastructure  and that many areas with high internet use have begun to experience interruptions in telephone service 
these carriers have petitioned the federal communications commission to impose access fees on internet service providers and online service providers 
if these access fees are imposed  the costs of communicating on the internet could increase substantially  potentially slowing the increasing use of the internet 
this could in turn decrease demand for tumbleweed s services or increase the costs of doing business 
tumbleweed may have liability for internet content 
as a provider of internet communication products and services  tumbleweed faces potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials transmitted online 
any imposition of liability  particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage  could be costly and could require us to implement measures to reduce exposure to this liability 
this may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue selected service or product offerings 
we do not and cannot screen all of the content generated by users of tumbleweed s product but may be exposed to liability with respect to this content 
furthermore  certain foreign governments  such as germany  have enforced laws and regulations related to content distributed over the internet that are more strict than those currently in place in the us other countries  such as china  regulate or prohibit the transport of telephonic data in their territories 
failure to comply with regulations in a particular jurisdiction could result in fines or criminal penalties or the termination of service in one or more jurisdictions 
moreover  the increased attention focused on liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could impact the growth of internet use 
liability insurance may not cover claims of these types  or may not be adequate to indemnify against all liability that may be imposed 
tumbleweed is a defendant in purported securities lawsuits 
on july   three complaints were filed by david h 
zimmer  congressional securities  inc and other plaintiffs against interface systems  inc a company tumbleweed acquired in and various additional defendants  including interface s prior president and chief executive officer  robert a 
nero  and fiserv correspondent services  inc  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the three complaints contained substantially similar allegations of false and misleading representations by various defendants allegedly designed to inflate interface s stock price 
the complaints sought relief under the federal securities laws on behalf of purported classes of persons who purchased  held  or sold shares of interface stock  and under various other causes of action 
on july   the court granted tumbleweed s motion to transfer the lawsuits to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan  which  on april   dismissed with prejudice plaintiffs class allegations and federal securities law claims that purportedly arose under section b of the securities exchange act of also on april   plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint that i consolidated the separate actions into one action  ii added certain new plaintiffs  iii withdrew congressional securities  inc as a plaintiff  and iv added claims for breach 
table of contents of fiduciary duty and negligent misrepresentation  which are the sole remaining claims in the case 
on may   tumbleweed filed a motion to dismiss these claims  which motion has remained pending before the court while the case has continued to proceed through the discovery phase 
the accompanying financial statements do not include a reserve for any costs for damages  if any  that might result from this uncertainty 
tumbleweed believes this consolidated action is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against it and seek its dismissal 
an attorney issued a press release on march  stating that he had filed a purported securities class action lawsuit  alleging the violation of federal and state securities laws  on behalf of persons who acquired the common stock of tumbleweed other than purchasers of tumbleweed s initial public offering during the time period from august  and october   inclusive 
according to the press release  the lead plaintiff in this purported class action lawsuit is a person whose deceased husband purchased approximately  shares of securities of commerce one  inc in addition  the press release states that this purported class action lawsuit names tumbleweed communications corp 
as a defendant  along with jeffrey c 
smith and joseph c 
consul who served as tumbleweed s chief executive officer and chief financial officer  respectively  during that time period 
tumbleweed has not been served with a summons or a complaint with respect to this purported securities class action lawsuit 
although tumbleweed believes these lawsuits are without merit  no assurance can be given about their outcome  and an adverse outcome could significantly harm tumbleweed s business and operating results 
moreover  the costs in defending the lawsuits could harm future operating results 
internet and technology related stock prices are especially volatile and this volatility may depress tumbleweed s stock price 
the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities of technology companies  particularly internet related companies  have been highly volatile 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies 
the institution of this type of litigation against tumbleweed could result in substantial costs and a diversion of tumbleweed s management s attention and resources  which could harm tumbleweed s business and prospects 
tumbleweed s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage or prevent an acquisition of tumbleweed  which could depress tumbleweed s stock price 
tumbleweed s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit changes of control that are not approved by its board of directors 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of tumbleweed s common stock 
in particular  tumbleweed s certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors and prohibits stockholder action by written consent 
these provisions require advance notice for nomination of directors and stockholders proposals 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  this law prevents a person who becomes the owner of or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock from engaging in specified business combinations for three years unless specified conditions are satisfied 
in addition  tumbleweed s certificate of incorporation allows its board of directors to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval 
this could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
the issuance of preferred stock also could effectively limit the voting power of the holders of tumbleweed common stock 
the provisions of tumbleweed s certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  may discourage or prevent an acquisition or disposition of tumbleweed s business 

table of contents tumbleweed may not be able to maintain its listing on the nasdaq national market  and if tumbleweed fails to do so  the price and liquidity of tumbleweed s common stock may decline 
the nasdaq stock market has quantitative maintenance criteria for the continued listing of common stock on the nasdaq national market 
the requirements include maintaining a minimum bid price per share of as of march   tumbleweed was in compliance with all nasdaq national market listing requirements 
however  there have been recent periods when the closing bid price per share for tumbleweed s common stock has dropped below although tumbleweed s bid price has generally been above per share  if the bid price of tumbleweed s common stock price slips below per share for more than trading days  tumbleweed may be required to effect a reverse stock split or become subject to a delisting action of tumbleweed s common stock on the nasdaq national market 
tumbleweed may nonetheless be unable to comply with the quantitative maintenance criteria or any of the nasdaq national market s listing requirements and other rules in the future 
if tumbleweed fails to maintain continued listing on the nasdaq national market and must move to a market with less liquidity  tumbleweed s financial condition could be harmed and its stock price may decline 
if tumbleweed were to be delisted  it could have a material adverse effect on the market price of  and the liquidity of the trading market for  tumbleweed s common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tumbleweed currently does not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses in hong kong  the netherlands  switzerland  or the united kingdom denominated in the respective local currency 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
tumbleweed does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of tumbleweed s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed rate equal to the then prevailing interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in commercial paper and money market funds 
in general  our investments are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   none of our cash equivalents were subject to market risk
