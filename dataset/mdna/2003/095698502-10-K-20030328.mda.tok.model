table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
we use a calendar fiscal year 
we provide software designed to improve the way companies sell and market 
our intelligent selling systems are unique because they allow our customers to incorporate their specific sales and marketing expertise into our application software 
the combination of the intelligence embedded in our applications and their own best practices allows our customers to automate important sales and marketing processes that would otherwise require significant time and effort from their product  marketing and sales experts 
our revenues are derived from the licensing of our software and the sale of related services 
the license agreement for our software typically provides for an initial fee for limited use of the software in perpetuity  with use limited by the number of servers cpus  business unit  geographic area  brand or other similar limitations 
service revenues are principally derived from consulting services  maintenance and training 
our maintenance agreements typically are payable in advance  entitle customers to receive software updates  maintenance releases and technical support  and have a one year term 
consulting services and training are generally sold on a time and materials basis 
we market our application suite primarily through a direct sales force 
we also engage in alliances with systems integrators and technology vendors to assist us in marketing and selling our software and related services 
some of our customers use systems integrators to implement our product  and systems integrators are a significant influence in our customers purchasing decisions 
we primarily target our products to the manufacturing and retail industries but have also delivered solutions to customers in wide range of industries  including education  energy  healthcare  pharmaceuticals and telecommunications 
while our revenues to date have been derived principally from customers in the united states  international revenues accounted for of our revenues for and of our revenues for we believe that international revenues may represent a significant portion of our total revenues in the future but may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in the near term 
although we have a limited operating history  our quarterly operating results have experienced seasonal fluctuations in the past 
quarterly results fluctuate based on several factors  including our customers fiscal year  budgeting cycles  sales incentive plans  slow summer purchasing patterns and general economic conditions in markets where we conduct business 
to date  we have derived a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers 
no single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues for while we do not anticipate that any one customer will represent more than of total revenues in  we do expect that a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our license and service revenues in a given quarter 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of total revenues in  of revenues in and of revenues in the loss of a major potential customer or the delay or cancellation of anticipated significant license contracts would adversely affect our revenues and operating results in a particular quarterly period 
failure to obtain a significant number of new customers or additional orders from existing customers in any period would adversely affect our business and operating results 

table of contents we believe that  to be successful  we must expand our customer base  expand our relationships with our existing customer base  grow our relationships with consulting and system integrator partners  and continue to enhance our application suite 
our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations of future revenues over the long term  and are largely fixed in the short term 
as such  a delay in completion of new customer license contracts or the recognition of revenues from one or more license contracts could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in net losses in a given quarter being greater than expected 
overview of in the fourth quarter of  we completed a restructuring accompanied by a strategic re organization designed to focus the company on our target industries 
as we have developed products and focused our marketing on the manufacturing and retail sectors  we have re organized our sales and marketing resources along these two distinct industry groups one for manufacturing  and one for retail 
difficult economic conditions persisted throughout  and sales contraction continued from during the year  we signed new customers  a decrease from new license contracts signed in our license revenues decreased to million in from million in our total revenues of million in were down compared to revenues of million reported for on the positive side  we were successful in significantly decreasing our cost structure in compared to resulting in reduced net loss of million in  compared to million in  and operating cash outflows of million in compared to million in we reduced our cost structure in through three restructuring programs that included reductions totaling approximately employees 
in january  july  and october of  we implemented restructuring plans intended to strengthen our operating performance and competitive position by preserving cash and reducing costs 
the october restructuring activities also included accrual for vacant facility charges 
the total restructuring charge amounted to million 
on april   we completed the acquisition of the cybrant corp 
cybrant through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of blue martini with and into cybrant  with cybrant surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of blue martini the merger 
the cybrant products enable customers to sell complex products and services 
the operating results of cybrant have been included with our results beginning with the date of acquisition 
on november   we implemented a one for seven reverse split of our common stock 
as a result of this reverse split  every seven outstanding shares of our common stock were combined into one share of common stock 
immediately after the reverse split  the number of outstanding shares of our common stock was reduced from approximately million shares to approximately million shares  and the per share price of our common stock as listed on the nasdaq national market rose from at the close of trading on november  to at the open of trading on the nasdaq national market on november  the results of operations section below discusses our results in more detail 
results of operations revenues license 
license revenues totaled million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the decrease in license revenues in as compared to was due to a decrease in average size and number of license transactions 
the decrease in license revenues in as compared to was due to a decrease in software licenses to new customers 
in we transitioned the license revenue model from enterprise license to limited use license 
the limited use license is usually limited to a number of servers cpus  business units  geographies  brands or other similar limitations 
we believe that the decrease in average size of license 
table of contents transactions is due partly to our offering of limited use licenses which are generally smaller in size than enterprise transactions while offering greater possibility for follow on licensing  and partly to competitive pricing pressure 
we attribute the decrease in license revenues in part to the overall global economic and business conditions that adversely impact information technology spending  particularly by companies in our target markets 
our business is affected by the economic and business conditions of these target markets and the level of demand for information technology within these industries  resulting in an increase in the average length of our sales cycles  a marked increase in competitive pricing pressure and a decrease in the average revenues derived from license transactions as well as in the total number of such license transactions in compared to and compared to overall economic conditions continue to be extremely difficult and customers in our target markets have reduced their capital spending 
we expect these conditions to persist in the foreseeable future  thus affecting our license revenue levels 
we began offering software products acquired from the cybrant acquisition in the second quarter of because our professional services related to these arrangements were deemed essential to the functionality of the software  we initially accounted for license revenues from the cybrant software products using the percentage of completion method under sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in the fourth quarter of  upon repeated successful implementations of the cybrant application  we determined that our professional services were not essential to the functionality of the software  and as such  in the fourth quarter of  we began to recognize license transactions relating to the cybrant software products upon delivery  instead of using the percentage of completion method  subject to meeting all other revenue recognition criteria 
service 
service revenues include revenues from consulting  technical support maintenance and to a lesser extent training activities 
service revenues totaled million  million and million for   and  respectively 
as a percentage of total revenues  service revenues were  and for  and the decrease in service revenues in absolute dollar terms in compared to was due primarily to reductions in both our maintenance revenues and our consulting service engagements 
the reduction in maintenance revenue is primarily a result of a decrease in new license revenues and a decrease in renewal rates 
the reduction in consulting revenues is due primarily to a decrease in the scope and the size of service engagements resulting from an overall reduction in license activities 
the increase in service revenues in as compared to was primarily due to increased consulting service engagements and customer maintenance agreements  as well as an increase in training revenues 
we expect that our service revenues will continue to fluctuate 
the statement of operations has been reclassified to conform to the presentation to reflect certain out of pocket expenses reimbursed by customers as revenues and cost of revenues in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf topic d  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
the impact was an increase to both service revenues and cost of service revenues of million for the year ended december  this reclassification was not made in the statement of operations for  as the amounts were not separately tracked 
cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues generally consists of royalty payments to third parties  amortization of prepaid royalties and amortization of purchased intangible assets for technology that is either embedded in or bundled with our software 
cost of license revenues for includes amortization of intangible assets acquired in the cybrant acquisition as well as accelerated amortization totaling  related to technology rights in the form of prepaid royalties for which we reduced the estimated useful lives 
cost of license revenues was million in compared to million in and million in these amounts represented of license revenues in  in and in the decrease in costs of license revenues in absolute dollar terms in from was due to reduction in royalties expense arising from the reduction in license revenues  which was partially offset by amortization of intangibles acquired in the cybrant acquisition and the accelerated amortization of prepaid royalties as discussed above 
in  we wrote off the majority of the assets that were previously amortized as costs of license 
these assets included some of the long lived assets discussed below under the heading impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
the increase in 
table of contents cost of license in from was due to amortization of technology acquired in late  partially offset by reduced license revenues 
based on agreements currently in place  cost of license revenues in will consist of a fixed amount of approximately  for amortization of remaining acquired technology and payments required under technology license arrangements  and variable amounts estimated to be approximately of license revenues for payments required under technology license arrangements 
service 
cost of service revenues consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  costs of services provided by third party subcontractors engaged by us  allocated overhead costs  and depreciation of equipment used to provide consulting services  technical support and training 
allocated overhead costs for costs of services and other expense categories include facilities  information systems  and other corporate infrastructure costs 
cost of services revenues totaled million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to resulted primarily from the reduction in force and other cost saving actions implemented in the increase in absolute dollars in as compared to was primarily due to increased personnel costs associated with a higher annual average headcount in compared to because our cost of service revenues are relatively fixed  our cost of services  when expressed as a percentage of related service revenues  may fluctuate in the near term  based primarily on our related service revenues 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  and other personnel related expenses associated with our direct sales and marketing personnel  allocated overhead costs  amortization of deferred marketing costs  and costs of marketing programs including trade shows  advertisements  promotional activities and media events 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the decrease in from was due primarily to lower spending on marketing and advertising programs  lower personnel related expenses resulting from reductions in force and other cost saving actions  lower amortization of deferred marketing costs related to warrants issued to a system integrator that was written off as part of the impairment evaluation in offset by the amortization of warrants issued in and intangibles relating to order backlog arising from the cybrant acquisition 
sales and marketing expenses changed slightly from to we expect to continue monitoring discretionary spending closely and expect that sales and marketing expenses will decline in absolute dollars in the near term reflecting the reorganization and reduction in force actions that were implemented in and the impairment of other intangible assets 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses for engineering personnel  allocated overhead costs  costs of contractors  and depreciation of equipment used in the development of our software products 
development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized  subject to recoverability 
to date  all costs related to the development of our software have been expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in from was primarily due to a decrease in personnel related expenses resulting from reductions in force started in and continued in  other cost saving actions and a credit of  arising from a joint research and development effort with an alliance partner in the increase in from was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs associated with a higher headcount 
we expect that research and development expenses will decline in absolute dollars in the near term reflecting the reorganization and reductions in force implemented in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our finance  human resources  legal  and other administrative functions 
these costs consist principally of salaries and other personnel related expenses  professional fees  provision for doubtful accounts  equipment depreciation  and allocated overhead costs 
general and administrative expenses totaled million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the decreases in from was primarily due to the reductions in force and other cost saving actions which started in and continued in expenses in and remained fairly consistent 
we expect that general and administrative expenses in will be at a level similar to 
table of contents stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense benefit totaled  million and million in  and  respectively 
stock based compensation consists of the net amortization of deferred stock compensation relating to stock options that vest over time and the stock based compensation expense associated with immediately vested stock options and warrants granted to non employees 
deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the exercise price of stock option grants to employees and the deemed fair market value of our common stock at the time of grant 
deferred stock based compensation is amortized to expense over the period during which the common stock and stock options vest using an accelerated method allowed by generally accepted accounting principles 
the reported expense is net of adjustment for accelerated deferred stock compensation amortization previously recognized for terminated employees 
we recorded deferred stock compensation of   and million in  and  respectively 
in and  we granted immediately vested stock options and warrants to certain non employees resulting in charges of  and million  respectively 
these amounts reflect the fair value of these stock options and warrants based on the black scholes option pricing model 
deferred stock compensation may fluctuate in the short term due to the variable plan accounting associated with a stock option exchange program initiated in the fourth quarter of  under which  outstanding employee stock options with exercise prices at or above per share approximately of the total eligible were exchanged for replacement stock options at the fair market value 
these replacement options have an exercise price of  vest over a five month period ending in may and expire in september under variable plan accounting  we will record compensation expense during the term of the stock options reflecting the net increase in our stock market price above the option exercise price 
one hundred sixty nine employees participated in the program  representing approximately of all eligible employees 
our ceo  cfo  and directors were not eligible to participate 
the variable plan accounting resulted in no charge in impairment of long lived assets and goodwill in september  a sharp decline in our stock price resulted in our market capitalization being significantly below our net asset value 
we determined that this circumstance triggered a review of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  we performed an impairment analysis of our property and equipment  intangible assets and other long lived assets  other than goodwill  and determined that the carrying amount of property and equipment  intangible assets and other long lived assets exceeded their respective fair values 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
the remaining balances in property and equipment and acquisition related technology and intangibles are depreciated and amortized  respectively  over their remaining estimated lives  generally through the end of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment if a sfas no 
triggering event has occurred 
accordingly  we performed an impairment analysis of its goodwill arising from the cybrant acquisition 
as we have determined that we operate in a single segment with one reporting unit  the fair value of our reporting unit was determined based on our market capitalization on the date of the impairment testing 
as a result of this analysis  we wrote off all million of goodwill in we estimated the fair value of our long lived assets based on a combination of the market  income and replacement cost approaches 
in the application of the impairment testing  we were required to make estimates of future operating trends and resulting cash flows and judgments on discount rates and other variables 
actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates 
the impairment charge to goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets from the impairment review resulted in a write off of the net book value as follows goodwill acquisition related technology other intangible assets property and equipment total in process research and development 
approximately  of the purchase price in the cybrant acquisition 
table of contents represents the estimated fair value of acquired in process research and development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was charged to expense upon the acquisition date 
the value assigned to purchased in process research and development comprises development projects that were labeled at the acquisition time as versions and of the cybrant product that were valued by employment of a discounted cash flow model using discount rate of 
version was commercialized in  version was still in process as of december  restructuring charges 
during and  we implemented restructuring plans intended to strengthen our future operating performance and competitive position by preserving cash and reducing costs 
as part of these restructurings  we reduced our employee force by approximately employees in and approximately employees in some of the restructuring actions also included vacating excess facilities 
these actions resulted in net restructuring charges of million in and million in as of december   approximately million is recorded as accrued restructuring charges relating to lease obligations  which will be paid through as of december   we have accrued restructuring charges of million related to excess facilities 
these accrued charges reflect estimates with respect to the time it will take to sublease the facilities  sublease terms  and sublease rates 
should there be changes in real estate market conditions or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the remaining vacant facilities  adjustments to the idle facilities lease losses reserve may be necessary in future periods based upon then current actual events and circumstances 
the following tables summarize the activity related to restructuring activities in and in thousands accrued at december  total expense non cash charges cash payments accrued at december  lease cancellations idle facility severance and related charges accrued at december  total expense non cash charges cash payments accrued at december  lease cancellations idle facility severance and related charges asset write downs interest income and other  net interest income and other  net consists of interest income from cash  cash equivalents and short term investments partially offset by interest expense associated with capital leases and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
interest income and other  net was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in from was primarily due to lower interest rates and the decline in balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the increase in over was primarily due to higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents and investments as a result of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in july  partially offset by lower interest rates in foreign currency transaction losses were approximately  in and and immaterial in we would expect interest income to decrease as the amount of cash and cash equivalents available for investment decreases as cash is used in operations 
in addition  due to current prevailing interest rates  reinvestment of maturing marketable securities is estimated to generate lower interest income 

table of contents income taxes from inception to december   we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any tax provision or benefit 
as of december   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through the california net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through because of our limited operating history  our losses incurred to date and the difficulty in forecasting our future results  management does not believe that the realization of the related deferred income tax asset is more likely than not 
therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance against the net deferred income tax assets

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
we incurred net losses in each quarter since inception and may continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future 
no conclusions about our future results should be drawn based on the results of our operations for any quarter  as quarterly results are not indicative of the results for a full fiscal year or any other period 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  down from million as of december  our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds  commercial paper and us treasury and government agency securities 
all of our investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value based on quoted market prices in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
during  net cash used in operating activities was million compared to million in net cash used in operating activities in and was primarily the result of net losses of million and million  respectively  after adjustments for non cash items and for changes in operating accounts totaling million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  principally related to the net sale of short term investments 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  related to the net sale of short term investments  partially offset by purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets 
net cash used by investing activities in was million primarily due to the net purchase of short term investments  and purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets 
net cash used by financing activities was  in  which consisted of repayments of debt and capital lease obligations offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
cash provided by financing activities was million in and principally related to the net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our 
table of contents employee stock purchase plan 
the cash provided by financing activities in was principally related to the net proceeds received from the initial public offering 
in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to of our outstanding common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased and retired approximately  shares of our common stock in open market transactions at prevailing market prices for a total cost of approximately  including commissions 
if we continue to repurchase our outstanding common stock  additional cash will be used 
we expect that for the foreseeable future  our operating costs and expenses will constitute a significant use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may use our cash resources to fund acquisitions or invest in other businesses  technologies or product lines 
we currently anticipate that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated operating requirements for at least the next months 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that this additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on reasonable terms and not dilutive to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we could have to accept financing on terms we viewed as unreasonable or that were dilutive to our stockholders  or to pursue alternative options  such as seeking a merger or acquisition  or in the worst case  winding down our operations 
if we were to seek additional financing today  we do not believe it would be available on reasonable terms 
the existence or even the anticipation of an uncertain economic environment by potential customers in the markets in which we operate has affected the demand for our applications  caused pricing pressures for our products  increased customer requests for extended payment terms  and substantially reduced our sales activity during and  and may continue to do so in future periods  which could in turn affect our liquidity 
commitments our principal commitments as of december  consist of obligations under operating leases  letter of credit agreements  and royalty agreements 
we expect to fulfill our commitments through our working capital 
lease commitments 
we lease certain facilities  including our corporate headquarters  under operating leases 
rent expense for  and was million  million  and million respectively 
future minimum lease payments under operating lease with non cancelable terms of over one year as of december  were as follows excluding lease commitments reflected as part of accrued restructuring liabilities on the balance sheet in thousands year ending december  thereafter total letters of credit 
at december   million of cash equivalents are held in trust as security for a letter of credit for guarantee of lease payments for leased office space 
such cash equivalents will be restricted until the expiration of the lease term in royalties 
we license and incorporate into our products technologies from third party software providers 
under the terms of these license agreements  which expire at various dates up to june  we pay royalties at various rates and amounts  generally based on unit sales or revenues 
royalty expense was  million and million for   and  respectively 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate 
table of contents our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  realization reserve  impairment of long lived assets  accrued liabilities  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in the notes to the financial statements 
we have identified the following as critical estimates employed in applying critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended  and generally recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we allocate revenue on software arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we identified three critical accounting estimates with respect to applying our revenue recognition policy 
the first critical accounting estimate with respect to our revenue recognition policy related to whether or not our professional services for products acquired from the cybrant acquisition were essential to the functionality of the software 
we began offering software products acquired from the cybrant acquisition in the second quarter of because our professional services related to these arrangements were deemed essential to the functionality of the software  we accounted for license revenues from the cybrant software products using the percentage of completion method 
in the percentage of completion method  we evaluated  on a quarterly basis  completion status of a project by accounting for actual hours worked over total estimated time to complete the project 
in the fourth quarter of  upon repeated successful implementations  it was determined that our professional services were not essential to the functionality of the software  as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we began to recognize license transactions relating to the cybrant software products upon delivery instead of using the percentage of completion method  subject to all other revenue recognition criteria 
the second critical accounting estimate with respect to our revenue recognition policy related to estimating percentage of completion for certain revenue transactions that require such estimation 
we review each transaction at quarter end and apply an estimate of percentage of completion to the contract amount to determine the appropriate revenue recognition 
we calculate the percentage based on contractual milestones met or  where the contract does not involve milestones  on hours incurred relative to total estimated hours to complete a project 
we evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates based on the type of services we render and our overall role in a project 
the third critical accounting estimate with respect to our revenue recognition policy is related to determining whether an undelivered element reflects a significant incremental discount 
we typically do not include undelivered software products in our arrangements 
on occasion  we may give the customer an option to purchase additional software products at specified prices 
we evaluate whether these options provide the customer with significant incremental discounts to the optional software 
we primarily consider the discount of the optional products relative to the discount of the delivered software products  however  there is judgment involved in determining whether discounted prices on the optional software  when incremental  are also significant 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
accounts receivable is recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts and realization reserves 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance and realization reserve by considering the accounts receivable aging  customer concentrations  the customer s expected ability to pay  our collection history with each customer  available information regarding customer satisfaction and current economic trends 
we review any outstanding past due balances to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors discussed above 
in addition  we maintain a general allowance for doubtful accounts for all invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and the realization reserve represent our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowance or reserve in the future 
accrued liabilities 
the idle facility lease losses were based on our lease commitments offset by our best estimate expected sublease income and related costs 
these estimates are based upon management s estimate of the time 
table of contents required to sublet the facility and the amount of sublease income that will be generated once the facility is sublet 
should there be changes in real estate market conditions or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the remaining vacant facilities  adjustments to the idle facilities lease losses reserve may be necessary in future periods 
included in accrued employee compensation at december  and is an amount relating to an obligation arising from an employment agreement of a former executive officer  which would require us to reimburse certain costs to the former officer s previous employer amounting to million 
at the time that amount was accrued  we had to make estimates of the amount of the potential liability as well as an assessment of its likelihood of occurrence 
as of december   we have not received a release from the obligation from the officer or from his employer and accordingly have maintained the accrued liability in the financial statements 
impairment assessment 
we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill  once recorded  not be amortized  but tested for impairment at least annually 
see notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our policy and impairment review and related write off in we determined the fair value of our long lived assets based on a combination of the market  income and replacement cost approaches 
in the application of the impairment testing  we were required to make estimates of future operating trends and resulting cash flows and judgments on discount rates and other variables 
actual future results and other assumed variables could differ from these estimates 
stock based compensation 
we have elected to continue to account for employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method  as prescribed by apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and interpretations thereof collectively apb versus the fair value method prescribed by sfas accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
accordingly  deferred compensation is only recorded if the current price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price on the date of grant 
we record and measure deferred compensation for stock options granted to non employees at their fair value 
deferred compensation is expensed on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the related stock option  which is generally three to five years 
we disclosed pro forma financial information we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
through december   we also disclosed and discussed certain pro forma financial information in our quarterly earnings release and investor conference call 
our pro forma financial information did not include restructuring charges  stock based compensation  stock based deferred marketing expense  in process research and development  acquired intangible assets  and impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
we believed the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings release and compare that gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting forcosts associated with exit or disposal activities  which supercedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exitan activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring

addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that a liability be recognized when it is incurred and should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   its adoption will not have an impact on our historical financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock 
table of contents based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas no 
also amends certain disclosure requirements under accounting principle board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ended after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december  factors that may impact future operating results risks related to our financial condition we have incurred losses throughout our operating history 
these losses may continue for the foreseeable future  and we may not achieve profitability 
for the twelve months ended december   we incurred net losses of million  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur losses on both a quarterly and annual basis  and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
moreover  we expect to continue to incur significant costs of services and substantial operating expenses 
therefore  we will need to significantly increase our revenues to achieve and maintain profitability and a positive cash flow 
we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
our declining cash balance and declining and volatile stock price have affected our potential and current customers and partners perception of our viability  which in turn could affect our ability to close sales and partnership transactions 
concerns about our perceived financial viability were a factor in multiple potential and actual customer transactions and partner relationships during and we attribute these concerns primarily to the following we are not yet profitable and thus must use our cash balance offset by revenues to fund our operations  our stock price experienced a dramatic decline from to  our stock price has been  and continues to be  extremely volatile  and many of our competitors are better funded  more established  or significantly larger than we are 
we will continue to use our cash balance offset by revenues to fund our operations until we achieve profitability which may not occur  thus  we expect our cash balance will continue to decline during therefore  if these conditions do not improve significantly in the next year  we expect these concerns about our perceived viability to continue 
in june  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to of the company s outstanding common stock 
as of december   the company had repurchased and retired  shares of its common stock in open market transactions at prevailing market prices for a total cost of approximately  including commissions 
if we continue to use our cash balance to repurchase our outstanding common stock  our cash balance may decline at a more rapid pace during the remainder of in late  our board of directors and stockholders approved a one for seven reverse stock split  which raised our stock price by a factor of seven  whether and the extent to which this will alleviate our potential and current customers and partners perception of our viability remains to be seen 
because our stock price is low and volatile  we could be at risk of having our stock delisted from the nasdaq national market  which would harm our business in a number of ways 
our stock is publicly traded on the nasdaq national market  or nasdaq 
nasdaq rules require the stock of a company whose stock price remains below per share for consecutive business days or which fails to maintain a public float market value of greater than million for consecutive business days to be delisted removed from the nasdaq exchange such that shares can no longer be traded on nasdaq  unless the company s stock price or public float market value exceeds the minimum standard for at least consecutive business days within a day grace period 
our stock price was 
table of contents near or below for a substantial portion of and  resulting in our board of directors and stockholders approving a one for seven reverse stock split in order to maintain a stock price of more than for consecutive business days within a day grace period 
there is no guarantee that our stock price will remain over or our public float market value will remain greater than million  and if our stock were to be delisted from the nasdaq national market  it is likely that customers  partners  and investors may be less likely to do business with us on terms that we view as reasonable  and our operating results would suffer accordingly 
cost reduction efforts may harm our productivity and service levels 
beginning in  we instituted various cost control measures affecting various aspects of our business operations 
we also reduced our workforce by approximately employees in and approximately employees in given current economic conditions and our declining revenues over the last several quarters  we may in the future be required to take additional reductions in force and other cost saving actions to reduce our losses and to conserve cash 
the failure to achieve such future cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
moreover  even if we are successful with these efforts and generate the anticipated cost savings  there is no assurance that these actions will not adversely impact our employees morale and productivity  the competitiveness of our products and business  and the results of our operations 
risks related to our products if we fail to keep pace with technological innovation  improve our existing products  or develop new products  our application suite could become obsolete and our revenues would decline 
the market for our application suite is marked by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  internet related technology enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in client demands and evolving industry standards 
new products based on new technologies or new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
to succeed  we will need to enhance our current application suite and develop new products on a timely basis to keep pace with developments related to internet technology and to satisfy the increasingly sophisticated requirements of our clients 
enterprise application software technology is complex  and new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods  we cannot be certain that we will successfully develop and market new products  new product enhancements or new products compliant with present or emerging internet technology standards 
our future revenues will depend  in significant part  on our ability to successfully develop and license new and enhanced versions of our application suite  and our ability to continue diversifying our offerings by developing and licensing new products 
if we are not able to successfully improve our existing products and develop new products  or if we develop new products and they do not achieve market acceptance  or if we were to experience delays in either  our revenues are likely to decline 
if we fail to release new versions and upgrades of our application suite in a timely manner  customers may license competing products and our revenues may decline 
we may fail to introduce or deliver new products on a timely basis  if at all 
in the past  we have experienced delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of enhancements to our application suite 
to date  these delays have not had a material impact on our revenues 
if we are unable to ship or implement new products or enhancements to our application suite when planned or at all  or fail to achieve timely market acceptance of these new products or enhancements  we may suffer lost sales and thus reduce our revenues 
our future operating results will depend on demand for our application suite  including new and enhanced releases that are subsequently introduced 
if our application suite does not successfully function for customers with large numbers of transactions  customers or product offerings  we may lose sales and suffer decreased revenues 
our application suite must be able to accommodate a large number of transactions  customers and product offerings 
large scale usage presents significant technical challenges that are difficult or impossible to predict 
to date  our application suite has been deployed by only a limited number of customers and  therefore  we can make no assurances that our application suite is able to meet our customers demands for large scale usage 
if our customers experience difficulty with our application suite during periods of high traffic or usage  the reputation of our products would suffer and our revenues would be likely to decline accordingly 

table of contents our interactive selling application may not be capable of handling our customers needs 
our interactive selling system is based on a powerful configuration engine that has proven successful for a number of customers 
nonetheless  it is possible that our system could fail to successfully meet a customer s needs if the customer s configuration requirements are extremely complex  exceptionally broad in scope  or not fully understood by us 
loss or inability of key technologies licensed to us by third parties could affect our ability to license our product 
our products incorporate technologies licensed from third party software providers 
in particular  we license array database modeling and configuration technology from array technology a s  and we license a rules engine from blaze software inc that automates the execution of business processes according to criteria set by our customers 
we may not be able to maintain or renew our license agreements for these technologies on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
the loss of these technologies could harm our ability to license our products and increase our costs until we identify or develop substitute technologies  license them  and integrate them into our product  even if substitute technologies are available  we may not be able to license those technologies on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
if our product does not operate with the wide variety of hardware  software and operating systems used by our current and potential customers  our revenues would be harmed 
we currently serve a customer base that uses a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  software applications and operating systems 
our application suite will gain broad market acceptance only if it can support a wide variety of hardware  software applications  systems  and standards  including those developed in the future 
defects in our application suite could diminish demand for our application suite and result in loss of revenues  decreased market acceptance  injury to our reputation and product liability claims 
as is not unusual for software companies  we have in the past discovered software errors and performance problems with various versions of our application suite after release  and  as a result  have experienced injury to our reputation  increased expenses  delays in the shipment of our application suite and our customers have experienced difficulty in deploying and operating our application suite 
errors in our application suite may be caused by defects in third party software incorporated into our application suite 
if so  we may not be able to fix these defects without the cooperation of these software providers 
since these defects may not be as significant to our software providers as they are to us  we may not receive the rapid cooperation that we may require 
we may not have the contractual right to access the source code of third party software and  even if we access the source code  we may not be able to fix the defect 
since our customers use our application suite for critical business applications such as e commerce  any errors  defects or other performance problems of our application suite could damage our customers businesses 
consequently  these customers could delay or withhold payment to us for our software and services  which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts or an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable 
in addition  these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses 
even if unsuccessful  a product liability claim brought against us would likely be time consuming and costly and harm our reputation  and thus our ability to license to new customers 
even if a suit is not brought  correcting errors in our application suite could increase our expenses 
a customer suit is pending against us alleging that our products failed to perform as represented 
the company believes that it has meritorious defenses against these allegations and intends to defend itself vigorously 
see part i  item  legal proceedings 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or become subject to intellectual property infringement claims  we may lose a valuable asset or incur costly and time consuming litigation 
our success depends in part on the development and protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely primarily on a combination of trade secret  copyright  trademark  and patent laws  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights and technology  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain the source code to our software or use other information that we regard as proprietary or could develop software competitive to ours 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate  and our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our product 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of 
table of contents infringement or invalidity 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we have one issued patent and several pending patent applications 
it is possible that some of the patents that we have applied for will not be issued  and even if issued  that some or all may be successfully challenged 
it is also possible that we may not develop additional proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  that any patent issued to us may fail to provide us with competitive advantage  and that the patents of others may materially harm our ability to do business 
in the future  a third party may bring suit claiming that our current or future products infringe its patents  trade secrets or copyrights 
any claims  with or without merit  could be costly and time consuming to defend  divert our management s attention  or cause product delays 
we have only one currently issued patent that we could use defensively against any company bringing such a claim 
if our product was found to infringe a third party s proprietary rights  we could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to be able to sell our product 
royalty and licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us or at all  which could materially harm our business 
risks related to our market and our ability to sell the current economic downturn has significantly affected demand for our products and services and may continue to adversely impact future revenues 
the existence of economic downturns in the markets in which we operate has decreased the demand for our applications  caused pricing pressures for our products  and substantially reduced our sales activity during and in  we signed new license contracts  a decrease from new license contracts signed in  in  we signed new license contracts  a further decrease from due in part to the macroeconomic conditions during and  customers reduced their information technology budgets and postponed or cancelled planned projects  including the evaluation and purchase of new applications  upgrades to existing applications  and purchase of related services 
as a result  our revenues have been negatively impacted  and may continue to be in the future 
the existence or even the anticipation of an uncertain economic environment by potential customers in the markets in which we operate has affected the demand for our applications  caused pricing pressures for our products  increased customer request for extended payment terms  and substantially reduced our sales activity during and  we expect it will continue to do so in future periods  which could in turn materially reduce our liquidity 
in addition  the financial  political  economic  and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the united states as well as the present war in iraq  have further weakened the global economy 
additional terrorist attacks or continued war could adversely affect our business  including revenues  financial condition  and results of operations 
our budgeting and forecasting depend on estimates of revenue growth in our target markets 
thus  the prevailing economic and political uncertainty makes it difficult to estimate anticipated license contract signings and future revenues 
the future performance of the overall domestic and global economies and the resolution of current international tension involving the united states will likely have a significant impact on our overall performance 
to the extent that the current downturn continues or increases in severity or scope  we believe demand for our products and services  and therefore future revenues  could be further reduced 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors 
we compete in the highly competitive crm market  which is subject to rapid technological change 
a principal source of competition is the internal information technology departments at potential customers  which may develop systems that provide for some or all of the functionality of our applications 
our products also compete with products  components  or solutions offered by art technology group  inc  broadvision  inc  e 
phipany  inc  firepond  inc  microsoft corporation  oracle corp  peoplesoft  inc  sap ag  selectica  inc  siebel systems  inc  trilogy software  inc  unica corporation  and vignette corporation 
compared to us  many of these competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial resources 
this may place us at a disadvantage in responding to our competitors pricing strategies  technological advances  advertising campaigns  strategic partnerships and other 
table of contents initiatives 
competitive pressures and our perceived viability in this market may make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers  and may require us to reduce the price of our products which could reduce our revenues and result in increased operating losses 
the sales cycle for our products is long  lengthening  and variable  which makes it difficult to predict our future revenues and may cause our operating results to vary significantly 
our revenues and results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
for example  certain indicators that we relied upon in developing our license revenue forecasts  such as our historical pattern of transaction timing and anticipated sales cycles  did not prove reliable during or during these periods  we continued to see extended sales cycles and postponed customer spending  our average sales period was six to twelve months in and through  compared to three to nine months in the period between initial contact with a prospective customer and the licensing of our application suite varies and can range from three to more than twelve months 
because of this variable sales cycle  the timing of revenues from the licensing of our application suite is difficult to forecast 
factors affecting our sales cycle  many of which are beyond our control  include many of our license agreements close within the last few weeks of each quarter  customers consider a number of factors related to our products and services  as well as our financial condition  before committing to purchase our application suite 
as a result  we spend significant time and resources informing prospective customers about our company  application suite  and other offerings  which may not result in a completed transaction but may nonetheless impact our operating margins  the licensing of our application suite is often an enterprise wide decision by our customers that involves many factors and decision makers  thus  if our customer s management  budget  or strategy changes  our ability to conclude license agreements may be affected  because a substantial portion of our quarterly revenues are derived from a small number of customers  delays in the signing of one or more large license agreements or the loss of a significant customer order may materially affect revenues and our operating results  due in part to macroeconomic conditions  customers have postponed or canceled planned projects  including the evaluation and purchase of new applications or upgrades to existing applications  and have increased customer requests for contract terms that affect our ability to recognize revenue 
these conditions may persist in the future  customer approval processes are unpredictable  delays in approvals  even after selection of a vendor  could impact the timing and amount of revenues recognized in a quarterly period  changes in our sales incentive plans may have an unpredictable impact on our sales cycle and contracting activities  and the number  timing and significance of enhancements to our application suite and the introduction by us or our competitors of new software may affect customers purchasing decisions 
because of this variation in sales cycle length  it is difficult for us to predict revenues and thus our operating results could be hard to estimate 
for example  if our license results do not meet our internal expectations  our service offerings would be affected since service revenues lags licenses and our services revenues would be reduced  which would harm our overall results since service expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues  and this pattern is likely to continue for the foreseeable future  as a result  our revenues could decline due to the loss or delay of a single customer order  the delay in recognizing revenue associated with a single customer order  or the failure to collect revenue associated with a single customer 
each quarter during our operating history  a relatively small number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of that quarter s total revenues 
we expect this to continue in the future 
thus  the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenues and operating results 
the timing of recognition of customer revenue may also affect our results 
customer payments that do not meet our revenue recognition policy requirements are recorded as deferred revenue 
although new agreements may not result in revenues in the quarter in which the agreement was signed  commissions and royalties may nonetheless become payable on such agreements during that quarter  which would impact our operating results 

table of contents we may not successfully establish ourselves in international markets or generate significant revenues abroad  which could result in slower revenue growth and harm our business 
in  we generated approximately of our total revenues from sales outside the united states 
we have established sales offices in australia  france  japan  netherlands  and the united kingdom  and have also generated sales in these and other countries 
we may add others in the future 
if we are not successful in continuing to license our application suite in international markets  or if we do not increase sales from outside the united states  we could experience slower revenue growth and our business could be harmed 
we anticipate devoting additional resources and management attention to expanding international opportunities 
our international expansion carries with it a number of additional challenges  including greater difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  expenses associated with foreign operations and compliance with applicable laws  difficulty and costs of managing a global technical support service that provides around the clock support  political or economic changes or instability in a specific country or region  expenses associated with localizing our product for foreign countries  differing intellectual property rights and the enforcement of such rights  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  different sales cycles and collection periods or seasonal reductions in business activity  multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  and foreign currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations 
increasing government regulation of the internet  imposition of sales and other taxes on products sold by our customers over the internet and privacy concerns relating to the internet could reduce the license of our application suite and harm our business 
federal  state or foreign agencies may adopt laws or regulations affecting the use of the internet as a commercial medium 
we expect that laws and regulations relating to user privacy  pricing  content and quality of products and services could indirectly affect our business 
current federal legislation limits the imposition of state and local taxes on internet related sales at this time 
congress may choose not to renew this legislation  in which case state and local governments would be free to impose taxes on electronically purchased goods 
the imposition of new sales or other taxes could limit the growth of internet commerce in general and  as a result  the demand for our application suite and services 
businesses use our application suite to capture information regarding their customers when those customers contact them on line with customer service inquiries 
privacy concerns may cause visitors to withhold personal data  which would limit the effectiveness of our application suite 
more importantly  even the perception of privacy concerns  whether or not valid  may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of our application suite 
risks related to system integrators our failure to develop and maintain strong relationships with consulting and system integrator firms csis would harm our ability to market our application suite  which could reduce future revenues and increase our expenses 
an increasing portion of our sales are influenced by the recommendation of our application suite by systems integrators  consulting firms and other third parties that help deploy our application suite for our customers 
losing the support of these third parties may limit our ability to penetrate our existing or potential markets 
these third parties are under no obligation to recommend or support our application suite and could recommend or give higher priority to their own products and services or those of other companies 
our inability to gain the support of csis or a shift by these companies toward favoring competing products could negatively affect our software license and service revenues 
some csis also engage in joint marketing and sales efforts with us 
if our relationships with these csis fail  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing of our application suite 
in many cases  these parties have extensive relationships with our existing and potential customers and influence the decisions of these customers 
a number of our competitors have longer and more established relationships with these csis than we do  and as a result those csis may be more likely to recommend competitors products and services and increase our expenses 

table of contents our failure to develop and maintain strong relationships with systems integrators would harm our ability to implement our application suite 
systems integrators assist our customers with the installation and deployment of our application suite  in addition to those products of our competitors  and perform custom integration of computer systems and software 
if we are unable to develop and maintain relationships with systems integrators  we would be required to hire additional personnel to install and maintain our application suite  which would result in higher expenses and delays in our ability to recognize revenue 
other risks changes in accounting policies created and interpreted by authoritative agencies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission  and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
our accounting policies that may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows rules relating to revenue recognition accounting for business combination stock based compensation goodwill and other intangible assets accounting changes to these or other rules or the questioning of current practices may have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business 
see the discussion under use of estimates and critical accounting policies in thus annual report for additional information about our critical accounting policies and some risks associated with these policies 
we acquired another company  and may enter into other mergers or acquisitions in the future  our business could be affected by the distraction and challenges posed by such transactions 
effective april   we acquired the cybrant corporation 
in the future  we may merge with  or acquire other technologies or companies 
entering into any business combination entails many risks  any of which could materially harm our business  including diversion of the attention of management or key technical employees from other business concerns  failure to assimilate the combined companies with the pre existing business  failure to integrate the acquired technology with our existing technologies  delays in our product releases caused by the integration of the acquired technology with our existing technologies  potential loss of key employees from either our pre existing business or the combined business  increasing our cost structure and thus our use of existing cash resources  dilution of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing equity securities  and assumption of liabilities of the merged or acquired company 
in the future  we may not be able to identify suitable merger or acquisition candidates  and even if we do identify suitable candidates  we may not be able to make these transactions on commercially acceptable terms if at all 
in our acquisition of cybrant  or if we merge with or acquire other companies in the future  we may not be able to realize the benefits we expected to achieve at the time of entering into the transaction 
in any future merger or acquisition  we will likely face the same risks as those discussed above 
further  we may have to use our cash reserves  incur debt  or issue equity securities to pay for any future merger or acquisition 
each of these financing alternatives could have negative consequences  by decreasing our cash reserves  increasing our debt burden  or diluting our existing stockholders 
we are the target of securities class action claims and a purported shareholders derivative complaint relating to our ipo  and are at risk of other litigation  which could result in substantial costs and divert management attention and resources 
during july  several securities class action complaints were filed in the united states 
table of contents district court for the southern district of new york against us  the underwriters of our initial public offering  our directors  and certain of our officers 
in each of these complaints  the plaintiffs claim that blue martini  certain of its officers and directors  and the underwriters of its initial public offering  or ipo  violated the federal securities laws because blue martini s ipo registration statement and prospectus allegedly contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted material facts regarding the compensation to be received by  and the stock allocation practices of  the ipo underwriters 
the complaints seek unspecified monetary damages  attorneys fees and other costs 
these cases have been consolidated into a single case along with similar complaints filed in the same court against hundreds of other public companies  the court recently ruled on a global motion to dismiss  granting it in part and denying it in part with respect to blue martini 
in may  a stockholder s derivative complaint was filed in california state court purportedly on behalf of the company and naming us  an underwriter of our ipo  and certain of our directors and officers as defendants 
the suit claims that the company s ipo price was deliberately set too low and that the company and its stockholders were harmed as a result 
the complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief 
the case was subsequently removed to federal court in california  where it was dismissed 
the plaintiff has filed an appeal to the ninth circuit court of appeals  where it has been consolidated for briefing purposes with similar cases filed against other public companies that conducted ipos of their common stock during the same period as the company 
the company believes that it has meritorious defenses against the lawsuits and intends to defend itself vigorously 
we may in the future be the target of additional securities class action litigation 
in the past  other types of securities class action litigation have been brought against companies following a decline in the market price of their securities 
this risk is especially acute for us because technology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years  particularly since mid  and  as a result  technology companies have been subject to a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in other industries 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to these or other securities or class action claims 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
we may have difficulty retaining or recruiting qualified personnel  which could impact the development and license of our application suite 
difficulty in hiring or retaining qualified personnel  or failure by newly hired personnel to develop necessary skills or reach expected levels of productivity  may weaken our ability to develop and market our application suite 
our success also depends on the continued contributions of key engineering  sales and marketing  management  and professional services personnel 
in particular  monte zweben  our chairman and chief executive officer  would be difficult to replace 
our ability to increase our sales will depend on our ability to recruit  train and retain top quality sales people who can target prospective customers senior management and generate and service large accounts 
in our industry  competition for qualified sales personnel is intense 
our directors and executive officers maintain significant control over blue martini software  which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate governance 
our directors  executive officers  and holders of or more of our outstanding common stock owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  monte zweben  our chairman and chief executive officer  together with related entities  owned approximately of our common stock as of this date 
these stockholders  acting together  and mr 
zweben  individually  will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other business combination transactions 
this control may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring or merging with us 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that could discourage or prevent a takeover  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include establishment of a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board may be elected at one time  authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  
table of contents limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent and requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporations law and the terms of our stock option plans may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of the company 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange through december   most of our recognized revenues have been denominated in united states dollars and were from both domestic and international customers 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes has not been material 
we expect that future license and service revenues will continue to be derived from international markets and may be denominated in the currency of the applicable market 
through december   we have expanded our international operations and have hired personnel in europe and asia pacific 
we have incurred limited operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
our future operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
in the future  we expect to engage in international sales denominated in both the united states dollar and in foreign currencies 
an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  may use economic hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we can make no assurances that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
through december   the company had not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities 
fixed income securities at december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  of million compared to million at december  our exposure to financial market risk  including changes in interest rates  relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
this exposure is limited by the establishment and strict monitoring of compliance with our investment policy which provides for investments in fixed income securities with maturities not exceeding months 
this policy also establishes credit quality standards and limits investment exposure to any one issuer 
we do not invest in any derivative instruments 
due mainly to the relatively short term nature of our available for sale investment portfolio  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates
