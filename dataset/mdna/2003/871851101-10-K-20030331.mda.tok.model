forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which cannot be predicted or quantified based on current expectations 
consequently  future events and results could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by  or underlying the forward looking statements contained in this report 
statements in this report  particularly in item business  item legal proceedings  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and the notes to consolidated financial statements describe certain factors  among others  that could contribute to or cause such differences 
some of the factors that may affect future results are discussed below 
the company and the company s customers are subject to global political  economic and market conditions  including military action and the threat of terrorism 
the united states has been experiencing a prolonged economic downturn  which has now extended to europe 
the company has yet to see significant improvement in economic conditions and cannot predict when improvements might occur 
the company s results have been and could continue to be adversely affected depending on the length and severity of the current economic downturn 
the company may experience a decline in sales as a result of the current economic conditions and the lack of visibility relating to future orders 
in response to economic conditions  the company from time to time adjusts its cost structure to reduce spending where appropriate 
a failure by the company to reduce costs in a timely manner could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
in addition  notwithstanding such cost control measures  a continuing decline in the economy that adversely affects the company s customers  causing them to limit their spending  would likely adversely affect the company as well 
the company s consolidated results of operations depends upon  among other things  its ability to maintain and increase sales volumes with existing customers  its ability to attract new customers and the financial condition of its customers 
the company cannot predict with any certainty whether it will be able to maintain or improve upon historical sales volumes with existing customers  or whether it will be able to attract new customers 
the company may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors 
the market for the company s products and services is intensely competitive and subject to constant technological change 
the company expects this competition to further intensify in the future 
some competitors are large companies with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than the company s 
in addition  new competitors may enter the company s key markets 
this may place the company at a disadvantage in responding to competitors pricing strategies  technological advances and other initiatives  resulting in the company s inability to maintain its gross margins in the future 
in many cases the company s products compete directly with those offered by other manufacturers and distributors 
if any of the company s competitors were to develop products or services that are more cost effective or technically superior  demand for the company s product offerings could decrease 
the company purchases certain materials and components for its products from various suppliers  some of which are located outside of the us any loss of  or interruption of supply from key suppliers may require the company to find new suppliers 
this could result in production or development delays while new suppliers are located  which could substantially impair operating results 
the company s pc products contain electronic components  subassemblies and software that in some cases are supplied through sole or limited source third party suppliers 
although the company does not anticipate any problems procuring supplies in the near term  there can never be any assurance that parts and supplies will be available in a timely manner and at reasonable prices 
if the availability of these or other components used in the manufacture of our products was to decrease  or if the prices for these components was to increase significantly  operating costs and expenses could be adversely affected 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are derived from the sale of products manufactured using licensed patents  software and or technology 
failure to renew these licenses on favorable terms or at all could force the company to stop manufacturing and distributing these products and the company s financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company s inventory is subject to risk due to technological change and changes in market demand for particular products 
the resulting excess and or obsolete inventory could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company currently has operations located in nine countries outside the united states  and non us sales accounted for of the company s revenue during the company s future results could be adversely affected by several factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a country s economic or political conditions  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and natural disasters 
it is the policy of the company to insure for certain property and casualty risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property  business interruptions resulting from property losses  workers compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
although the company believes that its insurance coverage is reasonable  significant events such as acts of war and terrorism  economic conditions  judicial decisions  legislation and large losses could materially affect the company s insurance obligations and future expense 
the company maintains credit facilities in the united states and in the united kingdom 
if the company is unable to renew or replace these facilities at maturity  its liquidity and capital resources may be adversely affected 
however  the company has no reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its facilities 
other factors that could contribute to or cause such differences include  but are not limited to  unanticipated developments in any one or more of the following areas i the effect on the company of volatility in the price of paper and periodic increases in postage rates  ii the operation of the company s management information systems  iii significant changes in the computer products retail industry  especially relating to the distribution and sale of such products  iv the potential for expanded imposition of state sales taxes  use taxes  or other taxes on direct marketing and e commerce companies  v timely availability of existing and new products  vi risks involved with e commerce  including possible loss of business and customer dissatisfaction if outages or other computer related problems should preclude customer access to the company  vii risks associated with delivery of merchandise to customers by utilizing common delivery services such as the united states postal service and united parcel service  including possible strikes and contamination  viii borrowing costs or availability  ix changes in taxes due to changes in the mix of us and us revenue  x pending or threatened litigation and investigations and xi the availability of key personnel  as well as other risk factors which may be detailed from time to time in the company s securities and exchange commission filings

the company does not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect the company s liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies below have been identified as critical to the company s business operations and understanding the results of operations 
certain accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty  and as a result  actual results could differ from those estimates 
these judgments are based on historical experience  observation of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that the company may be subject to  and the consolidated financial statements of the company accurately reflect management s best estimate of the consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company for the years presented 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
the company recognizes sales based on the terms of the customer purchase order  which indicates title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the customer upon shipment 
sales are shown net of returns and allowances 
reserves for estimated returns and allowances are provided when sales are recorded based on historical experience and current trends 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  including an analysis of the age of customer accounts and the company s historical experience with accounts receivable write offs 
the analysis also includes the financial condition of a specific customer or industry  and general economic conditions 
in circumstances where the company is aware of customer charge backs or a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts applicable to amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected is recorded 
in those situations with ongoing discussions  the amount of bad debt recognized is based on the status of the discussions 
while bad debt allowances have been within expectations and the provisions established  there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same allowance rate it has in the past 
inventories 
the company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for excess and obsolete or unmarketable merchandise are provided based on historical experience  assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
the adequacy of these reserves are evaluated quarterly 
if market conditions are less favorable than projected or if technological developments result in accelerated obsolescence  additional write downs may be required 
while markdowns and obsolescence have been within expectations and the provisions established  there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same level of markdowns it has in the past 
long lived assets 
management exercises judgment in evaluating the company s long lived assets for impairment 
the company believes it will generate sufficient undiscounted cash flow to more than recover the investments made in property  plant and equipment 
while the company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect its evaluations accounting for income taxes 
the determination of the company s tax provision is complex and requires significant management judgement in the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
since the company conducts operations internationally  its effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of its pre tax income or losses among locations with varying tax rates 
as the geographic mix of the company s pre tax results among its various tax jurisdictions changes  the effective tax rate may vary from period to period 
the company is also subject to periodic examination from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these examinations include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
the company has established  and periodically reevaluates  an estimated income tax reserve on its consolidated balance sheet to provide for the possibility of adverse outcomes in income tax proceedings 
while management believes that it has identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve it has established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances  it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  the company has provided a valuation allowance 
if the realization of those deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  an adjustment to the valuation allowance may be required  which could materially affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
in preparing estimates of future taxable income  the company has used the same assumptions and projections utilized in its internal forecasts and estimates 
stock based compensation 
the company applies the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for stock based compensation  therefore  no compensation expense has been recognized for stock options as options are granted at fair market value 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation provides an alternative method of accounting for stock options based on an option pricing model  such as black scholes 
the company has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas information and assumptions regarding compensation expense under the alternative method is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting developments in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes the cost associated with the asset retirement obligation by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is adjusted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires companies to recognize the costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred 
currently these types of costs are recognized at the time management commits the company to the exit disposal plan in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated subsequent to december  the company expects that adoption of this statement will not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
however  the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
fin also elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  and the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company has made the required disclosures in the consolidated financial statements as of december  and does not expect the recognition and measurement provisions of fin to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement 
sfas amends sfas accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in annual financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
finally  this statement amends apb opinion  interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  the company will continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method of apb opinion the company has adopted the disclosures provision of sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements as of december  and will be required to disclose these effects in its interim financial statements as well 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires the consolidation of variable interest entities  as defined 
fin requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
the interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the only variable interest entity of the company is its owned joint venture disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company is evaluating the impact of this interpretation on its consolidated financial results

at december  the notional amount of the interest rate collar was million million with an interest rate cap of and a floor of
