item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview memberworks designs and manages innovative membership programs and provides organizations with an opportunity to leverage the expertise of an outside provider in offering these membership programs 
membership service programs offer selected products and services from a variety of vendors for an annual fee or a monthly fee 
memberworks derives its revenues principally from annually renewable membership fees which are billed to the customer either on an annual or monthly basis 
in the case of annually billed membership fees  the company receives full payment at or near the beginning of the membership period  but recognizes the revenue as the member s refund privilege expires 
membership fees that are billed monthly are generally recognized when earned 
profitability and cash flow generated from renewal memberships exceed that of new memberships due to the absence of solicitation costs associated with new member procurement 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that are important to the company s financial condition and results of operations and involve subjective or complex judgments on the part of management  often as a result of the need to make estimates 
the following areas all require the use of judgments and estimates membership cancellation rates  deferred marketing costs  valuation of intangible assets  estimation of remaining useful lives of intangible assets and valuation of deferred tax assets 
estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and various assumptions that memberworks believes are appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
memberworks believes the following represent the critical accounting policies of the company as contemplated by financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements located in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition membership fees are billed through clients of the company primarily through credit cards 
during an initial annual membership term or renewal term  a member may cancel his or her membership in the program generally for a prorata refund of the membership fee based on the remaining portion of the membership period 
revenue from members who are charged on a monthly payment program is recognized as the membership fees are earned 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  deferred membership fees are recorded  net of estimated cancellations  and are amortized as revenues from membership fees upon the expiration of membership refund privileges 
an allowance for membership cancellations is established based on management s estimates and is updated regularly 
in determining the estimate of allowance for membership cancellations  management analyzes historical cancellation experience  current economic trends and changes in customer demand for the company s products 
actual membership cancellations are charged against the allowance for membership cancellations on a current basis 
if actual cancellations differ from the estimate  the results of operations would be impacted 
membership solicitation and other deferred costs the company s marketing expenses are comprised of telemarketing  direct mail  refundable royalty payments  non refundable royalty payments and advertising costs 
telemarketing and direct mail are direct response advertising costs which are accounted for in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  reporting on advertising costs sop 
under sop  direct response advertising costs are deferred and charged to operations over the membership period as revenues from membership fees are recognized 
refundable royalty payments are also deferred and charged to operations over the membership period in order to match the marketing costs with the associated revenues from membership fees 
advertising costs and non refundable royalty payments  which include fee per pitch  fee per sale and fee per impression marketing arrangements  are expensed when incurred 
total membership solicitation costs incurred to obtain a new member are generally less than the estimated total membership fees 
however  if total membership solicitation costs were to exceed total estimated membership margins  an adjustment would be made to the membership solicitation and other deferred costs balance to the extent of any impairment 
valuation of goodwill and other intangibles memberworks reviews the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets  and assesses the remaining estimated useful lives of its intangible assets  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the company reviews the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment by comparing such amounts to their fair values 
memberworks is required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment 
when determining fair value  the company utilizes various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions would cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such an event  memberworks would then be required to record a corresponding charge which would negatively impact earnings

the company concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired as of july  as of july   the company determined that there was an impairment of goodwill of million at one of its reporting units due to the change in methodology of calculating impairment under sfas concurrent with downward trends in the operations of the reporting unit

forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about the industry in which memberworks operates and the company s management s beliefs and assumptions 
these forward looking statements include statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and can be identified by the use of words such as believe  expect  estimate  project  continue or anticipate 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  cannot be foreseen and reflect future business decisions that are subject to change 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
among the many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements are o higher than expected membership cancellations  o lower than expected membership renewal rates  o changes in the marketing techniques of credit card issuers  o increases in the level of commission rates and other compensation required by marketing partners to actively market with memberworks  o potential reserve requirements by business partners such as the company s payment processors  o unanticipated cancellation or termination of marketing agreements and the extent to which memberworks can continue successful development and marketing of new products and services  o unanticipated changes in or termination of the company s ability to process membership fees through third parties  including clients  payment processors and bank card associations  o the company s ability to introduce new programs on a timely basis  o the company s ability to develop and implement operational and financial systems to manage growing operations  o the company s ability to recover from a complete or partial system failure or impairment  other hardware or software related malfunctions or programming errors  o the company s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms to finance the company s growth strategy and to operate within the limitations imposed by financing arrangements  o the company s ability to integrate acquired businesses into the company s management and operations and operate successfully  o further changes in the already competitive environment for the company s products or competitors responses to the company s strategies  o changes in the growth rate of the overall us economy  or the international economy where memberworks does business  such that credit availability  interest rates  consumer spending and related consumer debt are impacted  o additional government regulations and changes to existing government regulations of the company s industry  including the federal trade commission s amendment to its telemarketing sales rule which creates a national do not call list effective october   and o new accounting pronouncements 
many of these factors are beyond memberworks control  and  therefore  its ability to generate predictable revenue and income growth may be adversely affected by these factors 
memberworks cautions that such factors are not exclusive 
all of the forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k are qualified by these cautionary statements and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
except as required by law  memberworks does not have any intention or obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate the company has a million bank credit facility which bears interest at the higher of the base commercial lending rate for the bank or the federal funds rate plus per annum 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this bank credit facility as of june  as of june   availability under the bank credit facility was reduced by an outstanding letter of credit of million 
management believes that an increase in the commercial lending rate or the federal funds rate would not be material to the company s financial position or its results of operations 
if the company is not able to renew its existing credit facility agreement  which matures on march   it is possible that any replacement lending facility obtained by the company may be more sensitive to interest rate changes 
the company does not currently hedge interest rates with respect to its outstanding debt 
foreign currency the company has international sales and facilities in canada and therefore  is subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
canadian sales have been denominated in the canadian dollar and its functional currency is the local currency 
assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiary are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for the period 
accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders equity 
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations  and were not material for all periods presented 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic condition 
to the extent the company incurs expenses that are based on locally denominated sales volume paid in local currency  the exposure to foreign exchange risk is reduced 
the company has determined that the impact of a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company does not maintain any derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the company s adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
memberworks will assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
fair value the company does not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments  as the company does not hold any marketable securities as of june  memberworks does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
however  this does not preclude the company s adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
