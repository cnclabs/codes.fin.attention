critical accounting policies it is necessary for management to include certain judgements in the reported financial results of the company 
these judgements involve estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the accounting policies that require the more significant judgements by management are merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
in determining market value  management estimates the future sales price of items of merchandise contained in the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered in this determination include among others  current and recently recorded sales prices  the length of time product has been held in inventory and quantities of various product styles contained in inventory 
the ultimate amount realized from the sale of certain product could differ materially from management s estimates 
the company also estimates a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
valuation of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and annually when no such event has occurred 
management evaluates the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that have been open longer than one year 
when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those assets  impairment losses are recorded 
when events such as these occur  the impaired assets are adjusted to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
management s assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment  including current and future economic trends for stores  are subject to a high degree of judgement and if actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  additional losses may be recorded

deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to the company s operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for the deferred tax assets 
the company anticipates that future taxable income will be able to recover the full amount of the net deferred tax assets
