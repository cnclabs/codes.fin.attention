item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains trend analysis and might contain forward looking statements 
these statements are based on current expectations and actual results might differ materially 
among the factors that could cause actual results to vary are those described in this overview section and in business certain considerations 
the company s revenues are derived from providing hospitals and surgery centers with reusable gowns  towels  drapes  basins  and instruments for use in surgical procedures through a daily comprehensive surgical procedure based delivery and retrieval system  and also from the sale of disposable surgical products that supplement its reusable surgical product service 
the company s revenue growth is primarily affected by the number of customers  the number and type of surgical procedures it services for each customer  and pricing for its various types of surgical packs 
the company in made investments in staff  facility expansions  and additional reusable surgical products in anticipation of revenue growth 
as previously disclosed  the company has endured a period in which its revenues have been adversely affected by the competitive market for its products and services  including price reductions on some accounts to retain customers  as well as the continuing impact of lost customers and delays and obstacles in securing new customers 
revenue losses from these factors have been partially offset by significant growth in the company s instrument business  with revenue from that business increasing by to million in  compared to million in in  the company engaged joseph a 
largey as its new chief executive officer and charles l 
pope as its new chief financial officer 
the company s former ceo  cfo  and chief operating officer retired in the new management team is continuing initiatives started last year to refocus attention on sri s existing customers  with the objective of stemming loss of customers that adversely affected revenues beginning in the second half of and returning the company to its historically high customer retention levels 
the new team also plans a renewed emphasis on sales and marketing efforts  continued development of group purchasing organizations contracts and national accounts  strengthening supply partnerships  and continued cost and overhead reduction initiatives 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note b to the company s consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods that the company uses in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  amortization of reusable products  shrinkage and obsolescence of inventory and reusable surgical products  and goodwill impairments 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on its assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the overall aging of its accounts receivable 
sri would be required to increase this allowance  adversely affecting net income  if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates or actual defaults run at a rate higher than historical experience 
amortization of reusable products 
the company states its reusable surgical products at cost and computes amortization on a basis similar to the units of production method 
the company estimates the useful lives for each product based on its estimate of the total number of uses for which the product will be available 
sri estimates that its products using its three principal fabrics accounting for of its products will be available for   and uses based on several factors  including the company s actual experience with these products over the past ten years 
if its actual use experience with 
table of contents these products is shorter than these assumptions  the company s amortization rates for reusable products would increase  therefore adversely affecting its net income 
reserves for shrinkage and obsolescence for reusable surgical products 
sri determines its reserves for shrinkage and obsolescence of its reusable products by tracking those products with its bar coding system 
based on historical experience  the company believes that any products not scanned by the system for a day period are lost 
if actual losses exceed management s estimates  the company s shrinkage reserve would increase  adversely affecting its net income 
reserves for shrinkage and obsolescence for inventories 
sri determines its reserves for shrinkage and obsolescence of its inventories based on historical results  including the results of cycle counts performed during the year  and the evaluation of the aging of finished goods of reusable surgical products and disposable packs 
if actual losses exceed management s estimates and assumptions  the company s inventory reserves would increase  adversely affecting its net income 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no  goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january  the company tests goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in statement any impairment charge resulting from these transitional impairment tests would have been reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in sri s adoption of statement in did not affect its results of operations or financial position 
pursuant to statement  sri must test its intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
any impairment would adversely affect sri s net income
