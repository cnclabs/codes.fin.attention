item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we design  build  install  maintain  upgrade and monitor internal and external networks and other facilities for our clients  ranging from basic installation and construction to sophisticated engineering  design and integration 
our diverse and long standing client base  experienced management and integrated value added service offering provide a stable base of repeat business and enable us to quickly and efficiently meet client demands 
our primary types of contracts with our clients include master service agreements for all specified design  installation and maintenance services within a defined geographic territory for a multi year term  design and installation contracts for specific projects  and turnkey agreements for comprehensive design  engineering  procurement  installation and maintenance services 
the majority of our contracts provide that we will furnish a specified unit of service for a price per unit 
we recognize revenue as the related work is performed 
a portion of our work during was performed under percentage of completion contracts 
under this method  revenue is recognized on a cost to cost method based on the estimated percentage of total cost incurred to date in proportion to total estimated cost to complete the contract 
we anticipate that percentage of completion contracts will constitute a smaller percentage of our total contracts in as compared to prior years 
we also recognize revenue for monitoring services and project management services ratably over the term of the agreement 
clients are billed with varying frequency weekly  monthly or upon attaining specific milestones 
we perform a significant portion of our services under master service agreements  which typically are exclusive service agreements to provide all of the client s network requirements up to a specified dollar amount per job within defined geographic areas 
these contracts are generally for up to five years but are typically subject to termination at any time upon to days prior notice 
each master service agreement consists of hundreds of individual projects generally valued at less than  each 
these master service agreements are frequently awarded on a competitive bid basis  although clients are often willing to negotiate contract extensions beyond their original terms without re bidding 
master service agreements are invoiced on a unit basis as work is completed 
in addition  we have a significant number of long term maintenance and upgrade contracts with our broadband clients that are similar to master service agreements except they typically are not exclusive 
taken together  our master service agreements and master service like agreements constitute a majority of our contracts by prior years volume 
we derive a significant amount of our revenue from telecommunications clients 
during the latter part of and all of  certain segments of the telecommunications and broadband industries suffered a severe downturn that resulted in a number of our clients filing for bankruptcy protection or experiencing financial difficulties 
the downturn adversely affected capital expenditures for infrastructure projects  even among clients that did not experience financial difficulties 
capital expenditures by telecommunications and broadband clients in remained at low levels in comparison with prior years  and there can be no assurance that additional clients will not file for bankruptcy protection or otherwise experience financial difficulties in although we refocused our business on long time  stable telecommunications  broadband  governmental and other clients  there can be no assurance that these clients will continue to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure projects at current levels or that we will be able to increase our market share with these stronger clients 
additional bankruptcies or further decreases in our client s capital expenditures could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity 
direct costs included in costs of revenue are operations payroll and benefits  fuel  subcontractor costs  equipment rental  materials not provided by our clients  and insurance 
our clients generally supply materials such as cable  conduit and telephone equipment 
general and administrative expenses include all costs of our management personnel  severance payments  reserves for bad debts  rent  utilities  travel and business development efforts and back office administration such as financial services  insurance administration  professional costs and clerical and administrative overhead 
contracts often include retainage provisions under which to of the contract price is withheld from us until the work has been completed and accepted by the client 
we typically agree to indemnify our clients against adverse claims and warrant the workmanship of our services for specified time periods  usually one year 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  reserves and accruals  impairment of assets  income taxes  insurance reserves and litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue and related costs for short term construction projects ie  generally projects with a duration of less than one month are recognized as the services are rendered  generally using units of output 
we recognize revenue and related costs as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenue is subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
if we do not accurately estimate revenue and costs  the profitability of such contracts can be affected adversely 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
management analyzes historical bad debt experience  client concentrations  client credit worthiness  analysis of client financial condition and credit reports  the availability of mechanic s and other liens  the existence of payment bonds and other sources of payment  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we review the adequacy of reserves on a monthly basis 
if our estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable are incorrect  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required  which could reduce our profitability 
depreciation we depreciate our property and equipment over estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
we periodically review changes in technology and industry conditions  asset retirement activity and salvage to determine adjustments to estimated remaining useful lives and depreciation rates 
effective november   we have implemented the results of a review of the estimated service lives of our in use property and equipment 
useful lives were adjusted to reflect the extended use of much of our equipment 
in addition  the adjustments make the estimated useful lives for similar equipment consistent among all operating units 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets  consisting primarily of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

in analyzing potential impairment  we use projections of future cash flows from the assets 
these projections are based on our views of growth rates for the related business and anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
if changes in growth rates  future economic conditions or discount rates and estimates of terminal values were to occur  long lived assets may become impaired 
in  we recognized impairment losses related to long lived assets no longer in use and held for sale and certain assets in use 
valuation of intangible assets and investments we have adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with that statement  we conduct  on at least an annual basis  a review of our reporting units to determine whether their carrying value exceeds fair market value 
should this be the case  the value of our goodwill may be impaired and written down 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value corroborated by comparisons to estimated market multiples 
when necessary  we engage third party specialists to assist us with our valuations 
impairment losses are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
resulting in a write down of our goodwill  net of tax  in the amount of million  which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements as a cumulative effect due to a change in accounting principle as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment losses subsequent to adoption totalling million million  net of tax are reflected in operating income or loss on the consolidated statement of operations 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance policies subject to a million deductible per claim for certain auto  property and casualty and worker s compensation claims 
we are required to post letters of credit to secure our obligation to reimburse the insurance carrier for amounts that could potentially be advanced by the carrier that are not covered by insurance 
our estimated liability for claims and the associated expenses is reflected in other current and non current liabilities 
the determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the related liability is reviewed and updated semi annually 
if we do not accurately estimate the losses resulting from these claims  we may experience losses in excess of our estimated liability  which may reduce our profitability 
we also may be required to post additional collateral with the insurance carrier  which may affect our liquidity 
income tax liability we record income taxes using the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
restructuring charges during the second quarter of  we initiated a study to determine the proper balance of downsizing and cost cutting in relation to our ability to respond to current and future work opportunities in each of our service offerings 
the review not only evaluated our current operations  but also the growth and opportunity potential of each service offering as well as the consolidation of back office processes 
as a result of this review  we implemented a restructuring program which included four categories to accomplish elimination of service offerings that no longer fit into our core business strategy 
this process includes reducing or eliminating service offerings that do not fit our long term business plan 
reduce or eliminate services that do not produce adequate revenue or margins to support the level of profitability  return on investment or investments in capital resources 
this includes exiting contracts that do not meet the minimum rate on return requirements and aggressively seeking to improve margins and reduce costs 
analyze businesses that provide adequate profit contributions but still need margin improvements which includes aggressive cost reductions and efficiencies 
review new business opportunities in similar business lines that can utilize our existing human and physical resources 
the elements of the restructuring program included involuntary terminations of employees in affected service offerings and the consolidation of facilities 
the plan resulted in a pre tax charge of operations of million 
the involuntary terminations impacted both the salaried and hourly employee groups 
the total employees impacted was approximately as of december   all employees have been terminated and a balance of million severance and benefit costs remains to be paid 
we also closed approximately facilties during as part of the program and anticipate further office closures in as of december   we have remaining obligations under existing lease agreements for closed facilities of approximately million 
in addition to the costs noted above  we paid a consulting firm approximately million to assist us in preparing the plan  all of which was expensed in as the plan was complete as of december  we also recognized valuation allowances and impairment losses related to property and equipment of million in connection with the restructuring plan see note 
the following is a reconciliation of the restructuring accruals as of december  in thousands severance costs  lease cancellation costs  cash payments accrued costs at december   severance costs of million are reflected in costs of revenue and million is reflected in general and administrative 
lease cancellation costs are reflected in costs of revenue

this decrease was due primarily to a continued reduction in capital expenditures by incumbent communications and broadband clients and our decision to reduce services to certain competitive local exchange carriers clec due to adverse financial condition experienced by many such carriers 
in addition  our fourth quarter revenues were negatively impacted by weather conditions 
by industry category  revenues in our broadband construction operations declined by million  which was partially offset by increasing residential installation revenues which reflected a million increase 
our energy division reflected a million or decline in year over year revenues  which was partially the result of exiting certain unprofitable contracts as well as negative industry trends that resulted in reduced capital expenditures by our customers 
our revenues from government contracts experienced a slight decline in  primarily as a result of poor weather conditions in the southwestern  midatlantic  and southeastern united states 
inside plant and wireless revenues reflected dramatic declines as we began to significantly reduce these services 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented plans to exit certain unprofitable divisions and locations 
revenue from these locations aggregated million during our costs of revenue were million or of revenue for the year ended december   compared to million or of revenue for the same period in in  margins were adversely affected by under utilization of personnel and equipment and demobilization and redeployment costs as we adjusted to reduced capital spending by our client base 
in addition  our margins were negatively affected by additional reserves for insurance and litigation  restructuring charges and demobilization costs incurred to exit certain contracts and locations 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented plans to exit certain locations or businesses which incurred costs of revenue aggregating million in depreciation was million or of revenue for the year ended december   compared to million or of revenue for the same period in the decrease in the amount of depreciation expense in was due primarily to reduction of fixed assets resulting from disposals of excess equipment 
amortization expense decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in goodwill is no longer amortized in accordance with sfas no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  which was implemented january  the remaining amortization expense relates to non competition agreements 
general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue for the year ended december   compared to million or of revenue for the same period in included in general and administrative expenses in and are provisions for bad debts of million and million  respectively 
we incurred severance charges totaling million in in connection with our restructuring plan  and million in primarily related to our former president and chief executive officer 
excluding these provisions and charges  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue for the year ended december  and million or of revenue for the year ended december   an increase of million from the prior year 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in was affected by an overall decline in revenues experienced during the year without a similar reduction of expenses as well as additional costs incurred in connection with our restructuring plan 
we are currently implementing additional measures to streamline our cost structure  including exiting certain divisions and locations and activities that added approximately million to our overall general and administrative expenses in interest expense  net of interest income  was million or of revenue for the year ended december   compared to million or of revenue for the same period in we had no outstanding draws on our credit facility as of december  although we continue to incur interest expense from our long term debt and periodic credit line borrowing to meet working capital needs and support various letters of credit  we have reduced interest expense by million during the year 
this reduction was partially offset by a million reduction in interest income from notes receivable 
other expense was million or of revenue for the year ended december   compared to million of other expense or of revenue for the same period in in  a million gain on disposal of certain non core assets  investments and excess equipment was offset by a million valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of certain assets held for sale  long lived assets in use and investments 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our equity investment in a client and a million write down of non core international assets for the year ended december   our effective tax rate was approximately  compared to in the increase in effective rate was due to the nondeductibility of certain expenses which reduced the overall tax benefit in due to a proportionate increase in our loss for relative to year ended december  compared to year ended december  our revenue was billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in  representing a decrease of million or primarily due to a reduction in capital expenditures by telecommunications clients and a downturn in the economy generally 
our costs of revenue were million or of revenue for the year ended december   compared to billion or of revenue for the same period in in  margins were impacted by under utilization of personnel  leased equipment and other properties  losses related to our internal network service offerings  and demobilization and redeployment costs  all related to reduced capital spending by telecommunication carriers 
depreciation was million or of revenue for the year ended december   compared to million or of revenue for the same period in the decrease in the amount of depreciation expense in was due primarily to reduced capital expenditures 
amortization was million or of revenue for the year ended december   compared to million or of revenue for the same period in beginning january   goodwill was no longer amortized as a result of the adoption of sfas general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue for the year ended december   compared to million or of revenue for the same period in included in general and administrative expenses in is a reserve for bad debt of million related to receivables from clients that have filed for bankruptcy protection or are experiencing financial difficulties and a charge of million primarily related to severance for our former president and chief executive officer 
excluding these charges and reserves  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue  a reduction of million from the prior year 
interest expense  net of interest income  was million or of revenue for the year ended december   compared to million or of revenue for the same period in the increase in net interest expense of million was due primarily to higher debt balances in other expense was million or of revenue for the year ended december   compared to million or of revenue for the same period in in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our equity investment in a client and a million write down of non core international assets 
in  we recognized a net charge of million primarily related to write downs of non core international assets 
for the year ended december   our effective tax rate was approximately  compared to in the decline in effective rate was due to the nondeductibility of certain expenses which reduced the overall tax benefit in proportionately more than increased the tax provision in due to the greater amount of the loss in compared to the amount of income in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we derive a significant amount of our revenue from communications providers 
during the last two years  the communications industry suffered a severe downturn that resulted in a number of our clients filing for bankruptcy protection or experiencing financial difficulties 
the downturn adversely affected capital expenditures for infrastructure projects even among clients that did not experience financial difficulties 
capital expenditures by telecommunications and other clients in are expected to remain at low levels in comparison with prior years  and there can be no assurance that additional clients will not file for bankruptcy protection or otherwise experience financial difficulties in although we have refocused our business on established  stable communications  energy  government entities and other clients  there can be no assurance that these clients will continue to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure projects at current levels or that we will be able to increase our market share with these stronger clients 
further decreases in our client s capital expenditures could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity 
our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  capital expenditures  letters of credit and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations  borrowings under revolving lines of credit  tax refunds and sale of property and assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded certain restructuring charges aggregating million  including consulting fees  of which million remains outstanding as of december  we anticipate payment of approximately million during and million in net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in the net cash provided by operating activities in  in part resulted from collection of receivables  changes in other working capital components  and receipt of a million income tax refund resulting from losses incurred in proceeds from the income tax refund were used to repay all borrowings under our credit facility at the time of receipt 
we have a credit facility for us operations that provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of million  based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and unbilled receivables as well as a fixed amount of equipment that decreases quarterly 
although the credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million  the amount that can be borrowed at any given time is based upon a formula that takes into account  among other things  our eligible billed and unbilled accounts receivable  which can result in borrowing availability of less than the full amount of the facility 
as of december   availability under the credit facility totaled million net of outstanding standby letters of credit aggregating million 
substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit are all issued to the company s insurance providers as part of the company s insurance program 
we had no outstanding draws under the credit facility as of december  amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility mature on january  the credit facility is collateralized by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our us assets and a pledge of the stock of certain of our operating subsidiaries 
interest under the facility accrues at rates based  at our option  on the agent bank s base rate plus a margin of between and or its libor rate as defined in the credit facility plus a margin of between and each depending on certain financial thresholds 
the credit facility includes an unused facility fee of  which may be adjusted to as low as or as high as depending on the achievement of certain financial thresholds 
the credit facility  as amended in march  contains customary events of default including cross default provisions and covenants related to our north american operations that prohibit  among other things  making investments and acquisitions in excess of a specified amount  incurring additional indebtedness in excess of a specified amount  paying cash dividends  making other distributions in excess of a specified amount  making capital expenditures in excess of a specified amount  creating liens  prepaying other indebtedness  including our senior subordinated notes  and engaging in certain mergers or combinations without the prior written consent of the lenders 
in addition  deterioration in the quality of our billed and unbilled receivables will reduce availability under our credit facility 
the credit facility  as amended in march  contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a tangible net worth i on or after march  and on or prior to december  of million plus an amount equal to of net income from north american operations with certain adjustments for non recurring charge amounts for the period from september  through december  and ii any time after december  the greater of our tangible net worth from north american operations and million less million  plus an amount equal to of net income from north american operations from january  through the date of determination  and b a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio all as defined in the credit facility of at least for calendar year   of at least for the successive periods of three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  ten  eleven and twelve consecutive calendar months beginning january  and for calendar year of at least i for the successive periods of three  four and five consecutive calendar months beginning january   ii for the successive periods of six  seven and eight consecutive calendar months beginning january   iii for the successive periods of nine  ten and eleven consecutive calendar months beginning on january   iv for the period of consecutive calendar months ending on december  and v for the period of consecutive months ending on or after january  as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility  as amended in march during  we amended the credit facility to provide a sub facility for the issuance of letters of credit to secure our potential obligations under casualty insurance programs  to exclude a portion of the cost of implementing our new management information system  and to modify certain financial covenants 
failure to achieve certain results could cause us not to meet these covenants in the future 
we have million  senior subordinated notes due in february  with interest due semi annually  of which million  net of discount  is outstanding at december  the notes also contain default including cross default provisions and covenants restricting many of the same transactions as under our credit facility 
during the year ended december   we paid approximately million related to contingent consideration from earlier acquisitions that was reflected as a reduction in other current liabilities 
during the year ended december   we invested million in our fleet to replace or upgrade equipment and million in technology enhancements including approximately million of which was financed 
also  we received proceeds of approximately million on the sale of assets and disposal of assets held for sale and investments 
during year ended december   our financing activities primarily consisted of the repayment of all borrowings under our credit facility using the proceeds from the million income tax refund received  sales of assets and cash generated from operations 
the following table sets forth our contractual commitments as of december  in thousands and the payment obligations contractual obligations total thereafter senior subordinated notes   notes payable for equipment   other revolving debt obligations related to acquisitions   capital leases  severance operating leases       total       see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
primarily related to contingent consideration for acquisitions 
included in other liabilities in consolidated balance sheets 
total amounts other commitments committed thereafter standby letters of credit   executive life insurance       total       seasonality our north american operations are historically seasonally slower in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
this seasonality is primarily the result of client budgetary constraints and preferences and the effect of winter weather on external network activities 
some of our clients  particularly the incumbent local exchange carriers  tend to complete budgeted capital expenditures before the end of the year and defer additional expenditures until the following budget year 
revenue in local currency from our brazilian operations is not expected to fluctuate seasonally 
impact of inflation the primary inflationary factor affecting our operations is increased labor costs 
we have not experienced significant increases in labor costs to date 
our brazilian operations may be exposed to risks associated with high inflation 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no
