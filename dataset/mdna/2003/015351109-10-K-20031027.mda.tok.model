item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this report contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements are subject to certain factors which may cause our plans and results to differ significantly from plans and results 
table of contents discussed in forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in important factors regarding forward looking statements attached hereto as exhibit overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with a wide array of severe disease states  including cardiovascular  autoimmune and hematologic disorders  inflammation and cancer 
since our incorporation in january  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to drug discovery  research  and product and clinical development 
additionally  through our wholly owned subsidiary  alexion antibody technologies  inc  or aat  we are engaged in the discovery and development of a portfolio of additional antibody therapeutics targeting severe unmet medical needs 
our two lead product candidates are therapeutic antibodies that address specific diseases that arise when the human immune system produces inflammation in the human body 
antibodies are proteins that bind specifically to selected targets  or antigens  in the body 
after the antibody binds to its target  it may activate the body s immune system against the target  block activities of the target or stimulate activities of the target 
we are currently examining our two lead antibody product candidates in a variety of clinical development programs 
we are developing pexelizumab in collaboration with procter gamble pharmaceuticals  or p g  and rely on p g for the timely development and potential commercialization of pexelizumab to date  we have not received any revenues from the sale of products 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
as of july   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing operating losses for the next several years due to expenses associated with product research and development  pre clinical studies and clinical testing  regulatory activities  manufacturing development  scale up and commercial manufacturing  pre commercialization activities  developing a sales and marketing force  and increasing administrative personnel and professional services to support growth of our operations  and we may need to obtain additional financing to cover these costs 
we plan to develop and commercialize on our own those product candidates for which the clinical trials and commercialization requirements can be funded and accomplished by our own resources 
for those products which require greater resources  our strategy is to form corporate partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies for product development and commercialization  where we will stay play a major role 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements research and development expenses we record research and development expenses when they are incurred unless recoverable under contract 
research and development expenses include the following major types of costs salaries and benefit costs  research license fees and various contractor costs  depreciation and amortization of lab facilities and leasehold improvements  building and utilities costs related to research space  and lab supplies 
research and development expenses can fluctuate significantly from milestone payments due to third parties upon the attainment or triggering of contractual milestones such as the grant of a patent  fda filing  fda approval  or achieving a manufacturing or sales objective 
accrued research and development expenses are comprised of amounts owed to suppliers for research and development work 
table of contents performed on behalf of the company 
at each period end we evaluate the accrued expense balance related to these activities based upon information received from the supplier and estimated progress toward completion of the research or development objectives to ensure that the balance is appropriately stated 
these evaluations are subject to changes in estimate in subsequent periods 
goodwill at july   we carried million of goodwill  net  acquired in connection with our acquisition of prolifaron see financial note no 
 representing the excess cost over fair value of the net assets acquired 
on a prospective basis  this goodwill or any long lived investment asset is subject to annual impairment reviews 
impairment charges  if any  will be recorded as a component of operating expenses in the period in which the impairment is determined  if any 
long lived assets and prepaid manufacturing costs we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets and prepaid manufacturing costs based upon planned usage and projected cash flows 
these plans are subject to periodic revisions dependent on the success of our research and development programs and product candidate development 
accordingly  impairment charges may periodically occur if these revisions result in a change in planned asset use or cash flow generation 
we record cash advances paid to secure future long term manufacturing production at third party contract manufacturers as prepaid manufacturing costs 
these costs will be amortized over the period of manufacturing production 
these cash advances are subject to a refund  if the manufacturing facility is unavailable as scheduled or forfeiture if we terminate the scheduled manufacturing production pursuant to contractual terms 
we currently anticipate that we will proceed with production under the contract 
results of operations fiscal years ended july    and we earned contract research revenues of million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was principally due to decreased research payments from procter gamble pharmaceuticals  or p g  resulting from our december agreement per a binding memorandum of understanding  or mou  to revise our collaboration agreement with p g 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal year as compared to was primarily due to decreased research payments from p g  resulting from our revised collaboration agreement and the completion of the phase ii pexelizumab cpb study 
during fiscal year  we incurred research and development expenses of million 
for fiscal years and  we incurred research and development expenses of million and million  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal year as compared to was due to greater clinical trial costs while sustaining greater manufacturing costs for our two lead product candidates pexelizumab and eculizumab 
our agreement with p g to bear the first of the phase iii pexelizumab primo cabg trial costs  along with our concurrent clinical trials with eculizumab in pnh  rheumatoid arthritis  and membranous nephritis patients  resulted in higher clinical trial costs in fiscal as compared to  although we had completed in january our obligations associated with incurring the first of the projected primo cabg trial costs 
the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal year as compared to was attributable to higher clinical trial costs associated primarily with the phase iii pexelizumab primo cabg trial enrollment began in january as a result of the revised collaboration agreement with p g which required us to share in the pexelizumab development costs and greater clinical manufacturing costs associated with our two lead product candidates 
we expect that subject to the outcome of 
table of contents discussions regarding potential further clinical development requirements for pexelizumab  our overall research and development expenses in fiscal will decrease due to lower clinical trial study costs resulting from the phase iii primo cabg clinical trial completion 
this however will be offset by increased manufacturing development  scale up and manufacturing activities costs associated with our two lead c inhibitor candidates  pexelizumab and eculizumab 
however  clinical and manufacturing activities costs are highly dependent upon the initiation  performance and enrollment of clinical trials 
our general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal year as compared to was principally due to increased costs associated with our pre marketing and business development activities and increased personnel and professional services to support growth of our operations 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal year as compared to was principally due to higher payroll related costs 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase with our pre marketing and business development activities and increased personnel to support growth of our operations 
we concluded that further investment in the unigraft program by us did not meet sufficient criteria for continued development with our own resources  as compared to other internal programs  consequently  we have suspended our financial commitment to this program 
this termination of our unigraft program  following our inability to secure a collaboration to share in future funding of this program  resulted in an impairment to our unigraft manufacturing assets  principally the real estate  building  building improvements and capital lab and farm equipment at our subsidiary  columbus farming corporation  or cfc  resulting in a write down of approximately million of those assets 
as of july   the carrying value of those assets was approximately million after the write down 
these assets will continue to be classified as held for use until such time that we have the ability to dispose of them 
cfc had purchased the assets relating to the unigraft program in from our then partner in the xenotransplantation program  us surgical corporation  now a division of tyco healthcare  or tyco 
the purchase price was paid through the issuance of a million note 
all of these assets are pledged to secure cfc s obligations under the note 
cfc failed to make the august interest payment due under the note 
accordingly  cfc and tyco are in discussions regarding the sale of these assets and the application of the proceeds to cfc s obligations under the note 
the acquisition of prolifaron in fiscal resulted in a one time  non cash charge of million allocated to in process research and development projects 
in addition  we recognized approximately million of the purchase price as goodwill which was being amortized over the seven years following purchase 
the amortization of this goodwill resulted in a charge of million in the twelve months ended july  effective august   our adoption of sfas no 
caused the amortization of goodwill to cease 
total operating expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectfully 
total operating expenses in the twelve months ended july  included the one time non cash in process research and development charge and the non cash amortization of goodwill related to the acquisition of prolifaron 
other income expense  net  was an expense of million in fiscal year and income of million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively  and represents interest expense offset by investment income 
the other expense  net  in fiscal year as compared to was due to interest expense offset by lower investment income from lower market interest rates and lower cash balances 
the decrease in fiscal year  other income  net  as compared to was due to decreased investment income from lower 
table of contents cash balances and lower market interest rates 
a state tax benefit of million and million was recognized in each of fiscal year and resulting from our exchange of our fiscal  and incremental research and development tax credits 
during fiscal year  we recorded a million non cash charge that is related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle per the adoption of staff accounting bulletin no 
or sab we adopted sab in fiscal year and therefore changed our revenue recognition policy for up front non refundable payments from immediate recognition to deferral of the revenue with the up front fee amortized into revenue over the life of the agreement 
we recognized the non cash cumulative effect adjustment of million as of august  included in each of fiscal years  and were contract revenues of million related to the sab amortization of the up front  non refundable payment over the life of the agreement 
as a result of the above factors  we incurred net losses of million  million  and million or   and basic and diluted net loss per share for fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 
shown below are our statements of operations for fiscal years ended   and the following table displays the results of our operations relative to our results

as of july   our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaled million compared to million as of july  at july   our cash and cash equivalents consisted of million 
table of contents that we hold in short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as compared to july  was due to the use of funds to fund our operations  including prepaid manufacturing costs to reserve commercial manufacturing capacity  and capital equipment investments 
during the year ended july   we invested million in property  plant and equipment to support our research and development efforts 
we anticipate our research and development expense will increase generally for the foreseeable future to support our clinical and manufacturing development of our product candidates 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources together with the anticipated funding from our revised collaboration with p g  as well as the addition of our interest and investment income earned on available cash and marketable securities should provide us adequate resources to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements as currently planned for at least the next twenty four months 
this should also provide us adequate funding for the clinical testing of our c inhibitor product candidates and support our broad research and development of our additional product candidates 
our contractual obligations include our million of convertible subordinated notes due march  our annual payments of approximately million for operating leases  principally for facilities and equipment  and  an open letter of credit of  which serves as a security deposit on our facility in cheshire  connecticut 
in addition  cfc is the payer under a million note 
our commercial commitments consist of cancelable research and development  clinical development and manufacturing cost commitments along with anticipated supporting arrangements  subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses 
the timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs assuming we utilize our long term commercial scale product manufacturing capacity  which may or may not be realized  are contingent upon our clinical development programs progress as well as our commercialization plans 
under the terms of our agreement for lonza biologics plc  or lonza  to manufacture commercial supplies of eculizumab  we could owe penalties for failure to purchase a minimum manufacturing capacity volume or if we terminate the agreement prior to its expiration 
if we terminate the agreement  we could be required to pay for unused contracted or scheduled manufacturing capacity usage for up to months following termination  or at our election to make a termination payment of up to million  less partial return of any unused portion of prepaid manufacturing costs 
these obligations  commitments and supporting arrangements represent payments based on current operating forecast  which are subject to change 
further  under terms of our memorandum of understanding with procter gamble pharmaceuticals  we may be obligated to reimburse p g of cancellation costs under p g s third party pexelizumab manufacturing contract 
our portion of those cancellation costs could amount up to million 
additional payments  aggregating up to million  would be required if we elect to continue development under our current pre clinical development programs and specified development milestones are reached including achievement of commercialization 
approximately million of these costs may be incurred in the next three years 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the effect such obligations and commercial commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future fiscal years 
these do not include the aforementioned milestones and assume non termination of agreements amounts in millions and thereafter contractual obligations subordinated convertible notes note payable a operating leases total contractual obligations commercial commitments clinical and manufacturing development licenses research and development total commercial commitments a in august  the note payable will be classified as a current liability based upon the default in august  see discussion below 
in february  our wholly owned subsidiary columbus farming corporation  or cfc  purchased substantially all of the assets of the xenotransplantation program  including principally  land  buildings and laboratory equipment  from our then partner in the program  us surgical corporation  now a division of tyco healthcare  or tyco 
the purchase was financed through the issuance by cfc of a million note payable to tyco 
interest on the million note payable  at per annum  is payable quarterly by cfc 
in august  cfc was unable to make a scheduled quarterly interest payment under the note 
the principal balance under the note is stated to be due in may  but will be classified as a current liability when the note is deemed in default since cfc was unable to make the quarterly interest payment due to tyco 
the xenotransplantation manufacturing assets of cfc that were purchased from us surgical  including the real estate  are pledged as security for this note 
we have notified tyco that cfc operations have been suspended and that cfc is seeking to liquidate itself to fulfill its debt obligation as best as possible 
cfc has further notified tyco that it does not have the funds or assets to satisfy the million note  and was unable to make the quarterly interest payment due to tyco in august cfc has had discussions with tyco regarding the sale of the cfc assets and application of the proceeds to cfc s obligations under the note  as well as with regard to satisfaction of the note generally 
the event of default under the note requires the note to be classified as a current liability at the time of default 
if cfc s assets  consisting of property  plant and equipment with a current estimated fair value of million  are insufficient to satisfy the million note and other obligations of cfc  then the unpaid amount of the note may be discharged debt  recognized as other income in a future period to cfc 
we lease our headquarters and research and development facility in cheshire  connecticut that we relocated to in november the lease has an initial term of ten years and six months  expiring in december at this site  we lease a total of  square feet of space  which includes approximately  square feet related 
table of contents to research and laboratories 
we have incurred initial leasehold improvements aggregating approximately million 
in addition  we are paying a pro rata percentage of real estate taxes and operating expenses 
our pilot manufacturing plant  which may be used for producing compounds for some of our current and anticipated clinical trials  is expected to remain in new haven  connecticut and encompasses approximately  square feet of labs and offices 
the lease in new haven has an initial term of approximately years  ending in october with three options to extend of one year each 
we believe our research and development facilities and our pilot manufacturing facility  together with third party manufacturing facilities  will be adequate for our current ongoing activities 
alexion antibody technologies  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  leases approximately  square feet of labs  office space and unimproved storage in san diego  california 
the lease has a term of ten years  expiring in august in january  we entered into a collaboration with p g with respect to the joint development of pexelizumab 
in december  we and p g entered into a binding memorandum of understanding  or mou  pursuant to which we and p g revised our january collaboration 
under the revised structure per the mou  we and p g will share decision making and responsibility for all future us development and commercialization costs for pexelizumab  including clinical  manufacturing  marketing  and sales efforts 
prior to december  p g was generally funding all clinical development and manufacturing costs for pexelizumab 
the revised collaboration per the mou provides that we and p g each incur approximately of all phase iii clinical trial  product development and manufacturing  and commercialization costs necessary for the potential approval and marketing of pexelizumab in the us and that we will receive approximately of the gross margin on us sales  if any 
p g agreed to retain responsibility for future development and commercialization costs outside the us  with us receiving a royalty on sales to the rest of the world  if any 
we are responsible for paying royalties and licensing fees on certain third party intellectual property worldwide  if such intellectual property is necessary 
additionally  as part of the mou  we will receive milestone payments for achieving specified development steps  regulatory filings and approvals  but not for previously agreed sales milestones and we will generally forego further research and development support payments from p g 
we agreed to bear the first of projected costs associated with the us phase iii primo cabg clinical trials and p g will bear the second of such costs  with a final adjustment to make even the sharing of costs 
as of january   we had completed our obligation associated with the first of the projected costs 
it is expected that by the end of our first fiscal quarter of fiscal year  p g will complete its obligation with respect to the second of projected costs 
with the phase iii primo cabg completion  a final adjustment to make even the sharing costs will occur in fiscal reimbursements received from p g in connection with alexion services and related personnel and p g s cost share are recorded as a reduction of research and development and market research expense 
as part of the revised collaboration per the mou  p g agreed to continue to fund of the costs for the two phase ii clinical trials in acute myocardial infarction  ami  or heart attack  patients 
we and p g have agreed that each will share concurrently of the ongoing us pre production and development manufacturing costs for pexelizumab as well as any future ami phase iii clinical trial costs 
p g has the right to terminate the collaboration or sublicense its collaboration rights at any time 
if p g terminates the collaboration  p g is required to contribute its share of agreed to obligations and costs incurred prior to termination  but may not be required to contribute towards costs incurred after termination 
in the event that p g were to terminate the collaboration  under the mou  all rights and the exclusive license to our intellectual property related to pexelizumab would revert back to us 
the mou does not contemplate any payments to p g in the event p g were to terminate the collaboration  however  p g might seek to negotiate such a payment or 
table of contents might seek to sublicense its mou rights  rather than terminate the collaboration 
we rely heavily on p g for the development  manufacture and potential commercialization of pexelizumab 
termination of our agreement by p g or sublicense of its collaboration rights could cause significant delays in the development  manufacture and potential commercialization of pexelizumab and result in substantial additional cost to us 
for tax reporting purposes  as of july   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards  which expire through of which approximately million resulted from the exercise of nonqualified stock options and million of tax credit carryforwards  which expire commencing in fiscal provisions of the tax reform act of may limit our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year if certain events occur  including a provision relating to cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of over a three year period 
we believe that we have triggered these limitation provisions 
in september  we sold million shares of our common stock at a price of per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discount  fees and other expenses of approximately million related to the transaction 
we expect to use the net proceeds of the sale of common stock to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes  including additional clinical trials of pexelizumab and eculizumab  as well as other research and product development activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our investment portfolio we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
our short term investments and investments consist of us government obligations  high grade corporate notes and commercial paper 
all of our investments in debt securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the conservative nature of our short term investments and investments policy we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policies specify credit quality standards for our investments and limit the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our available for sale marketable securities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase of the financial instrument 
a decrease in year end market interest rates would result in no material impact on the net fair value of such interest sensitive financial instruments 
a increase or decrease in market interest rates on our subordinated convertible notes would result in no material impact on our notes
