overview we are a financial services holding company that  through our subsidiaries  provides investment advisory  insurance  financial planning and related services 
we operate in a highly regulated and competitive industry  that is influenced by numerous external factors such as economic conditions  marketplace liquidity and volatility  monetary policy  global and national political events  regulatory developments  competition and investor preferences 
our revenues and net earnings may be either enhanced or diminished from period to period by any one of or by a multiple of these external factors 
in addition  the passage of the graham leach bliley act in november of repealed depression era laws that separated commercial  investment banking and insurance activities 
such repeal may result in the intensification of the environment in which we compete by increasing the number of companies doing business in the financial services arena 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
these critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the company 
valuation of securities and other assets substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  these include cash  cash equivalents  and securities purchased under agreements to resell  deposits with clearing organizations  securities owned  and securities sold but not yet purchased 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net earnings or other comprehensive income in accordance with fasb  depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument 
where available  the company uses prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer price quotations 
fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
in addition  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for instance  the company generally assumes that the size of positions in securities that the company holds would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if the company were to sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value 
reserves the company records reserves related to legal proceedings in accrued expenses 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an employee of the company  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law 
each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge credit to earnings in that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual disposition of a legal proceeding could be greater or less than the reserve amount

management of these risks is critical to the company s financial strength and profitability and requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial trends and the economy as a whole 
senior management takes an active role in the risk management process 
the principal risks involved in the company s business activities are market  operational  regulatory and legal 
market risk market risk is the risk attributable to common macroeconomic factors such as gross domestic product  employment  inflation  interest rates  budget deficits and sentiment 
consumer and producer sentiment is critical to our business 
the level of consumer confidence determines their willingness to spend  especially in the financial markets 
it is this willingness to spend in the financial markets that is key to our business 
a shift in spending in this area could negatively impact us 
however  senior management is constantly monitoring these economic trends in order to enhance our product line to offset any potential negative impact 
operational risk operational risk refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution processing of transactions  deficiencies in the company s technology or financial or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in the company s control processes 
managing these risks is critical  especially in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volume 
failure to manage these risks could result in financial loss to the company 
to mitigate these risks  the company had developed specific policies and procedures designed to identify and manage operational risk 
these policies and procedures are reviewed and updated on a continuing basis to ensure that this risk is minimized 
regulatory and legal risk regulatory and legal risk include non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the risk of a large number of customer claims that could result in adverse judgments against the company 
the company is subject to extensive regulation in all jurisdictions in which it operates 
in this regard  the company has instituted comprehensive procedures to address issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  credit granting  collection activities  money laundering and record keeping
