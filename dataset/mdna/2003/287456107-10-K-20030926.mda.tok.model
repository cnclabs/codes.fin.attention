item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations operating segments effective september   the company changed its corporate name from elcor corporation to elkcorp to better identify itself with the elk brand name of its principal building products subsidiaries 
the building products segment consists of elk premium building products  inc and its operating subsidiaries collectively elk 
these companies manufacture premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingles  coated and non coated nonwoven fabrics used in asphalt shingles and other applications in the building and construction  filtration  floor coverings and other industries  and beginning with an october business acquisition  nontoxic wood composite decking  marine dock  and fencing products 
building products accounted for of consolidated sales in fiscal in fiscal  operating profit from the company s engineering  technologies business  which provides proprietary technologies and related engineering services to the natural gas processing industry as ortloff engineers  ltd ortloff  exceeded of consolidated operating profit 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  this business is required to be presented as a separate segment because it exceeded this quantitative threshold 
this business has not historically met the reporting test  nor is it typically expected to in the future 
other  technologies consists of the company s other operations 
these dissimilar operations are combined  as none individually meets the materiality criteria for separate segment reporting 
other  technologies includes the operating subsidiaries of cybershield  inc collectively cybershield  which applies precise conductive metal coatings to plastic components utilized in electronics enclosures to control the electromagnetic and radio frequency emissions of such devices  and to create circuitry and antennae for digital cellular phones  consumer electronics  and other electronic products  and  chromium corporation chromium  which is a leading provider of hard chrome and other surface finishes designed to extend the life of steel machinery components operating in abrasive environments 
a third operation  elk technologies  inc  develops and markets fabrics featuring versashield fire retardant coatings designed for use outside of traditional building products applications  including home furnishings and other consumer products 
this business has not yet produced significant commercial sales 
fiscal compared to fiscal overall performance during the fiscal year ended june   net income of  was higher than  in fiscal sales of  were marginally lower in fiscal than sales of  in fiscal consolidated operating income of  in fiscal was higher than  in the prior fiscal year 
operating income for fiscal included a  benefit from the reversal of noncash stock option compensation  compared to a  charge for this noncash item in fiscal in fiscal  the company changed its accounting for certain stock options from fixed awards with no compensation expense to variable awards  which generally results in periodic expense or income  as the company determined that variable accounting was more appropriate for such stock options 
pursuant to variable option accounting  income is charged or credited during each accounting period to reflect any excess or deficit of the market value of shares underlying vested options  from the exercise price of vested options 
based on a decline in the company s share price subsequent to june  and actions taken by the board of directors to terminate the feature of the incentive stock option plan that caused certain stock options to be accounted for as variable awards  the company recorded a reversal of the majority of fiscal noncash stock option compensation in the first quarter of fiscal the company now has no options subject to variable stock option accounting 
accordingly  subsequent to the quarter ended september   income has not been affected by variable accounting for stock options 
the company does not expect to issue further stock options requiring variable accounting 
operating income in fiscal also included a favorable settlement with a vendor resulting in  of income  and plant closure costs of  as a percentage of sales  operating income was in fiscal compared to in fiscal cost of sales was of sales in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
the impact of higher asphalt costs in fiscal was partially offset by  among other things  lower unit manufacturing costs and strict management of controllable expenses at the company s roofing plants 
the prior year percentage of cost of sales to sales was adversely affected by the aforementioned plant closure costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs in fiscal were  higher than in fiscal however  fiscal benefited from the  vendor settlement 
other sg a costs declined substantially in fiscal  primarily as a result of benefits received from the consolidation of cybershield s operations in the third quarter of fiscal as a percentage of sales  sg a costs were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal in fiscal  the company capitalized  of interest related to the construction of an additional tuscaloosa  alabama shingle plant and other significant capital projects 
no interest cost was capitalized in fiscal the average interest rate paid on indebtedness was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the company s effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the difference between years primarily relates to the impact of noncash stock option compensation on the effective tax rate 
results of business segments sales in the building products segment increased to  for the year ended june  compared to  in fiscal in fiscal  roofing products sales  which represented of building products segment sales  increased compared to fiscal unit shingle shipments in the last half of fiscal more than offset the impact of a general slowing in the roofing market early in fiscal the increase in demand for the company s roofing products was driven by strong roof replacement demand in the texas market as a result of widespread spring hail damage 
roofing activity in the northeast and midwest areas of the united states was hampered in the latter part of fiscal by persistent record spring rainfall from april to mid june for the year  unit shingle shipments in fiscal increased over fiscal for the month of june  unit shingle shipments set a company record 
strong demand is expected to continue during the remaining calendar roofing season as more normal summer weather patterns permit increased roofing activity in areas previously affected by persistent spring rains 
average selling prices for premium laminated asphalt shingles were about higher in fiscal than in fiscal  primarily as a result of shingle price increases in the second half of fiscal to recover higher asphalt costs and increases in other energy related costs 
however  the increases in unit sales and average selling prices were somewhat offset by a sales mix weighted proportionately more to lower priced products 
in fiscal  outside sales of performance nonwoven fabrics  which represented of building product sales  decreased compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of a weak commercial roofing market 
although overall production of nonwoven fabrics was comparable in fiscal to the prior fiscal year  in the current fiscal year a much higher proportion of nonwoven fabric production was consumed internally in the company s own manufacturing of shingle products 
intercompany nonwoven fabrics sales are eliminated in consolidation 
composite building products  which began operations in october  accounted for of building products sales in fiscal despite increased sales in fiscal  operating income for the building products segment of  was lower compared to  in fiscal prior year operating income included a  favorable vendor settlement 
asphalt costs in fiscal were  higher than in the prior fiscal year 
approximately  of these higher asphalt costs were offset by higher average sales per shingle unit 
management believes that the improved relationship between shingle pricing and asphalt costs in the latter part of fiscal will continue into fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  shingle inventories were repositioned into the texas market from other geographic areas to meet strong demand and to serve the company s texas market share 
higher freight transfer costs related to inventory repositioning negatively impacted fiscal operating earnings by approximately  start up inefficiencies in composite building products further reduced building products operating income in fiscal delayed delivery and production inefficiencies related to the start up of newly installed equipment reduced operating income for the year by approximately  despite these difficulties  management believes that demand for crosstimbers decking products currently exceeds the company s ability to produce it and that profitable operations will be achieved once anticipated production efficiency has been achieved 
sales in the engineering  technologies segment increased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase in licensing revenues was primarily the result of several key international projects in higher international licensing fees are the result of the company s strategy of establishing cooperative marketing or licensing arrangements with several key international suppliers of process technologies  providing ortloff with the opportunity to bid its technology packages on large international projects that might not otherwise be available to it 
licensing revenues can vary significantly between reporting periods since this business is largely project driven 
engineering  technologies operating income of  in fiscal was higher than  earned in fiscal  primarily as a result of higher technology licensing fees 
the other  technologies companies reported combined sales of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal significantly reduced volumes of cellular handset business caused cybershield s sales to decline significantly in fiscal cellular handset production previously in the united states and latin america has largely shifted to asia where the company has no significant operations 
the company does not expect these sales to return to the united states 
accordingly  cybershield s strategy has shifted away from reliance nearly solely on the cellular handset business to new markets for existing production capabilities and new technologies 
commercialization of exact  a proprietary process for applying precise conductive metal patterns to plastics or other components  together with other strategic moves including marketing partnerships with key supply chain partners and utilizing a network of manufacturing representatives to augment cybershield s internal sales efforts  are key strategies to diversify cybershield s sales among a wider variety of consumer  medical and military electronics applications 
management believes these strategic initiatives will return cybershield to profitability 
however  there are no assurances that they will be successful 
in the event that these initiatives are unsuccessful in returning cybershield to profitability  the company may be required to record an impairment charge relating to long lived assets 
the carrying amount of cybershield s long lived assets was  at june  chromium s sales were also lower in fiscal compared to the prior year period as a result of deferred maintenance expenditures by its railroad customers 
the other  technologies companies reported a combined operating loss of  in fiscal compared to an operating loss of  in fiscal chromium reported an approximate  operating loss during the current fiscal year compared to a modest operating profit in fiscal despite the significant reduction in revenues at cybershield  cost reductions allowed that subsidiary to limit its operating loss in fiscal to approximately  compared to an approximate  operating loss in fiscal which included  of plant closure costs relating to its canton  georgia plant 
the canton plant and certain idle equipment are being held for sale 
the carrying value of these assets was  at june  based on estimated fair value  less cost of disposal 
if the company is unable to realize the current carrying value  or if market conditions for these assets do not improve  additional write downs of these assets may be necessary 
the remaining fiscal loss in other  technologies resulted from start up costs relating to elk technologies  inc fiscal compared to fiscal overall performance during the fiscal year ended june   net income of  was higher than  in fiscal sales of  were higher in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the significant increase in both sales and income in fiscal is primarily attributable to significant improvements in operations in the building products segment 
consolidated operating income of  in fiscal was higher than  in the prior fiscal year 
operating income for fiscal was reduced by  of noncash stock option compensation  due to the change in accounting for certain stock options from fixed awards with no compensation expense to variable awards  which can result in periodic expense or income 
in fiscal  the company determined that variable accounting is more appropriate for such stock options 
the impact of variable accounting in fiscal was not material 
operating income for fiscal also included a favorable cash settlement with a vendor resulting in income of  and plant closure and related costs of  as a percentage of sales  operating income was in fiscal compared to in fiscal costs of sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the fiscal percentage of costs of sales to sales was adversely affected by cybershield s plant closure costs  higher depreciation costs relating to the myerstown  pennsylvania roofing plant  together with higher raw material and energy costs 
sg a costs in fiscal were significantly higher than in the prior fiscal year  due primarily to overall higher sales levels  increased selling expenses related to new product introductions  higher incentive compensation resulting from improved performance and retirement expenses related to management succession 
as a percentage of sales  sg a costs were of sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal however  in fiscal  the company capitalized  of interest related to the construction of the myerstown  pennsylvania roofing plant and other major projects 
no interest cost was capitalized in fiscal the average interest rate paid on indebtedness was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in the fiscal effective tax rate related primarily to the impact of noncash stock option compensation recorded on the effective tax rate and higher state income taxes 
results of business segments sales in the building products segment increased to  for the year ended june  compared to  in fiscal the significant increase in sales reflected a sharp rebound in shipments of premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingles that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continued throughout fiscal  together with higher average selling prices in fiscal  which were higher than in fiscal highly successful new products and warranty initiatives and a favorable inventory position  combined with lower interest rates in fiscal contributed to sharply higher sales for this business segment 
building products sales further benefited from success in penetrating markets served by its new myerstown  pennsylvania roofing plant  which met its performance test level of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  shipments of laminated shingles were adversely affected by weak economic conditions and harsh winter weather conditions in the northern united states and heavy winter and spring rains in many other parts of the country 
operating income for the building products segment increased to  in fiscal compared to  for fiscal fiscal operating income included a  favorable vendor settlement 
the cash settlement represented a reimbursement of certain general and administrative costs previously incurred by elk 
the increase in recurring operating income is primarily the result of a significant increase in shipments of premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingles and performance nonwoven fabrics 
increased product sales more than offset higher marketing costs and depreciation relating to the new myerstown  pennsylvania roofing plant 
revenues for the engineering  technologies segment were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal as a result of a higher level of licensing and consulting fees from international gas processing projects 
operating income for the engineering  technologies segment was  in fiscal compared to a  operating loss in fiscal  primarily as a result of the aforementioned increase in licensing and consulting fees 
sales for the other  technologies companies decreased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal cybershield s unit volumes declined  but average selling prices were higher  primarily as a result of an increased sales mix of units containing purchased plastic parts 
sales for chromium were also lower in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year due to lower unit volumes as railroads deferred maintenance expenditures 
the other  technologies companies reported a  operating loss in fiscal compared to  in operating income in fiscal the fiscal operating loss included  of plant closure and related costs pertaining to consolidating cybershield s operations 
fiscal included  of costs relating to the consolidation of manufacturing operations and initial production of products new to chromium s cleveland  ohio plant 
operating income for the other  technologies companies also reflect lower unit volumes and related margins at cybershield  costs associated with the ramp of several new handset components and production start up inefficiencies during the early part of fiscal at cybershield  and lower unit volumes at chromium 
despite these lower volumes  chromium was able to maintain modest profitability in fiscal due to cost reductions 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities are generally the result of net income  deferred taxes  depreciation and amortization  and changes in working capital 
in fiscal  the company generated cash flows of  from operating activities compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the decrease in cash flows generated in fiscal was primarily the result of changing dynamics in the significant components of working capital trade receivables  inventories  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
trade receivables at june  were  higher than at june  the majority of this increase was the result of record shipments in the building products segment in the latter part of fiscal  together with increased engineering  technologies receivables from technology licensing fees 
in accordance with normal industry practices  extended payment terms are granted to certain customers for roofing products shipped during the late winter and early spring months  with payments generally due during the spring or early summer 
at june   receivables from customer programs with extended due dates were  compared to  at june  extended term receivables outstanding at june  were due and collected in the first quarter of fiscal at june   manufactured inventories were  higher than at june  as production at the company s roofing plants continued at high rates throughout much of the current year 
the company believes that current year inventories are at favorable levels 
in the prior year  roofing product inventories had been reduced to less than desired levels 
the  decrease in accrued liabilities at june  compared to june  is primarily the result of the reversal of an accrual for noncash stock option compensation during the current fiscal year due to the impact of variable accounting for stock options and a declining stock price through the date that variable accounting was eliminated 
higher trade payables were primarily the result of cash management techniques and strategies used to maximize the company s cash flow 
the current ratio was to at june  compared to to at june  historically  working capital requirements fluctuate during the year because of seasonality in some market areas 
generally  working capital requirements and related borrowings are higher in the spring and summer months  and lower in the fall and winter months 
cash flows from investing activities primarily reflect the company s capital expenditure strategy 
net cash used for investing activities was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal approximately  of current year capital expenditures relate to construction of a second shingle plant at tuscaloosa  alabama  including the installation of certain infrastructure and material handling improvements designed to enhance the overall efficiency of the expanded facility 
approximately  was expended for productivity enhancements at certain of its other roofing plants 
during the current fiscal year  the company utilized  of cash for a business acquisition and subsequently invested  in incremental capital expenditures for this new subsidiary to increase manufacturing capacity 
capital expenditures are projected to be approximately  in fiscal  including approximately  to complete the new tuscaloosa plant  approximately  for productivity enhancement projects  and approximately  to upgrade certain key information technology platforms 
after fiscal  planned capital expenditures are currently expected to be approximately   per year 
cash flows from financing activities generally reflect changes in the company s borrowings during the period  together with dividends paid on common stock  treasury stock transactions and exercises of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal  compared to  used in fiscal and funds provided in fiscal of  in june  the company sold  in senior unsecured notes in a private placement transaction with a group of institutional investors 
in march the company sold  in an incremental note placement 
the proceeds of the original note placement were used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the company s existing revolving credit facility 
the incremental note placement proceeds were primarily used in the short term to fund increased seasonal working capital needs 
longer term  this debt will be used to fund the company s capital expansion plans 
there was no outstanding balance on the company s  revolving credit facility at june  other than  currently reserved for outstanding letters of credit 
an additional  increase in long term debt during fiscal was the result of a noncash adjustment in the fair value of long term debt resulting from an interest rate swap to effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on  of long term debt through this fair market adjustment is offset by recording a corresponding noncash amount in other assets for the value of the interest rate swap instrument 
the changes in the company s debt structure were made to extend the maturity structure of the company s debt on favorable terms  increase the company s total committed borrowing availability and better diversify the company s funding sources 
at june   liquidity consisted of  of cash and cash equivalents and  of available borrowings under its  committed revolving credit facility 
the debt to capital ratio after deducting cash and cash equivalents of  from  of principal debt was 
during fiscal  the company estimates it will internally generate approximately  in operating cash flows to partially fund its capital expenditures budget and other cash requirements 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be used to supply the balance of required funds 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated  special purpose entities 
the company s board of directors has authorized the purchase of common stock from time to time on the open market 
as of june   the company has repurchase authority of approximately  remaining 
no shares of common stock were repurchased in fiscal the following table summarizes the company s future payments relating to contractual obligations at june  in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt    operating leases      plant construction commitments   total contractual obligations      the only other significant commercial commitment the company has at june  is its  revolving credit facility  the term of which extends through november  the company s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental matters 
such laws and regulations are frequently changed and could result in significantly increased cost of compliance 
certain of the company s manufacturing operations utilize hazardous materials in their production processes 
as a result  the company incurs costs for remediation activities off site and at its facilities from time to time 
the company establishes and maintains reserves for such remediation activities  when appropriate 
current reserves established for known or probable remediation activities are not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
management believes that current cash and cash equivalents  projected cash flows from operations  and its existing debt capacity should be sufficient during fiscal and beyond to fund the tuscaloosa  alabama plant construction  other planned capital expenditures  working capital needs  dividends  stock repurchases and other cash requirements 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions it believes are reasonable based on the information available 
the accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include the following 
collectibility of accounts receivable the majority of the company s sales are in the building products segment and its primary customers are building material distributors 
due to consolidation in the industry  credit risk is concentrated 
ten customers typically account for about to of consolidated sales 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivables based on a combination of factors 
the balance in the reserve for doubtful accounts is evaluated on an ongoing basis based on such factors as customer s past payment history  length of time the receivables are past due  the status of customer s financial condition and ongoing credit evaluations 
accruals for loss contingencies contingencies  or uncertainties  by their nature  require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of loss 
accruals are established for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be estimated reasonably 
accrual balances are reviewed and adjusted periodically based on management s judgment of changes in specific facts and circumstances for each loss accrual 
key loss accruals for the company include product warranties product warranties are estimated and recorded based on factors such as an examination of known defects for potential exposure  claims paid history  independent data as to average length of time between asphalt roofing replacements and average length of home ownership 
litigation litigation reserves are determined on a case specific basis from evaluations by both management and outside counsel as to any probable exposure from litigation 
environmental exposure environmental exposure  primarily related to other  technologies companies  is evaluated by management and its environmental consultants when known or probable exposure is identified 
self insurance reserves the company partially insures itself against losses for both casualty and medical insurance 
reserves are calculated and maintained based on historical experience and specifically identified losses 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
the company records adjustments to the value of inventories based on various factors 
for the building products segment  adjustments may be made to inventory values based on the physical condition eg age and quality of the inventories 
for other  technologies companies  inventory adjustments are generally based upon the forecasted plans to sell its products and the sales prices that are expected to be realized 
inventories are adjusted to the lower of cost or market or written off if unsaleable 
these adjustments are estimates and can vary from actual requirements if inventories deteriorate  become otherwise damaged or obsolete  or if competitive conditions differ from expectations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended 
the majority of sales are for manufactured products  where revenue is recognized at the time products are shipped to customers 
such revenues  particularly in the building products segment  are subject to returns  discounts  volume rebates and other incentives  which are estimated and recorded based on sales activity and historical trends 
differences in revenues could result if actual experience differs from the historical trends used in management s estimates 
license revenue is recognized when a a customer contracts for the nonexclusive use of inventions covered by company patents  b there are no remaining items relating to the license contract that have to be accomplished by the company  and c the license fee is nonrefundable 
service revenues are recognized as they are performed 
revenue recognition may be subject to judgment and interpretation that the specific requirements of sab have been met 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  primarily plant  property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of any such assets may not be recoverable 
if the estimated sum of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the assets being reviewed  the company recognizes an impairment loss  measured as the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the estimate of future cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
the company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  changes in general economic conditions  industry conditions  customer requirements  technology or the company s business model 
market risks in addition to the risks inherent in its operations  the company is exposed to financial  market  political and economic risks 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding the company s exposure to the risks of changing commodity prices and interest rates 
the company has no significant foreign exchange risk 
derivatives are held from time to time only as part of a formally documented risk management program 
derivatives are held to mitigate uncertainty  volatility or to cover underlying exposures 
no derivatives are held for trading purposes 
the company has entered into derivative transactions related to its exposure to natural gas used in its manufacturing plants and to interest rate risk 
the company is required to purchase natural gas for use in its manufacturing facilities 
these purchases expose the company to the risk of higher natural gas prices 
to hedge this risk  the company entered into hedge transactions to fix the price on of its projected natural gas usage through october at expiration  this hedge was not renewed 
there are no natural gas hedge transactions in effect at june  however  it is anticipated that similar hedging strategies will likely be utilized in the future 
the company uses interest rate swaps to help maintain a reasonable balance between fixed and floating rate debt 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on  of its outstanding debt 
the fair value of this swap was  at june  based on outstanding debt at june   the company s interest costs would increase or decrease  for each theoretical increase or decrease in the floating interest rate 
credit risk the company is subject to credit risks applicable to cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
cash and cash equivalents are maintained at financial institutions or in short term investments with high credit quality 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable primarily relate to the large building material distributors that are the company s primary customers 
the company s largest customer accounted for of consolidated sales in both fiscal and fiscal the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition to determine the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company has not experienced significant credit losses for many years 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to those customers to whom the company makes significant sales 
new accounting standards in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement is effective for the company in fiscal sfas no 
requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred 
upon initial recognition of a liability  that cost is capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
based on current circumstances  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at a date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities after december  in august  the company relocated its corporate office to new leased space 
in accordance with sfas no 
 total unexpired lease costs of  on its previous leased space will be recorded to expense through march in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
fin also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the guarantor s noncontingent obligations associated with such guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are already effective and disclosed in the product warranties and acquisition footnotes 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the company does not expect the adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the company has no current or planned variable interest entities 
therefore  the adoption of fin had no impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
inflation and changing prices the company s primary financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america based on historical dollars 
accordingly  the financial statements do not portray the effects of inflation 
in recent years  inflation in the company s key markets has been moderate 
cost controls and improving productivity generally minimize the impact of inflation 
the costs of manufacturing  transportation and key raw materials  including but not limited to ceramic coated granules  asphalt  glass fibers  resins and mineral filler  together with the company s ability to pass along higher costs are generally influenced by factors other than inflation 
these factors include general economic and industry conditions  supply and demand  surpluses and shortages  and actions of key competitors 
forward looking statements in an effort to give investors a well rounded view of the company s current condition and future opportunities  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition and other sections of this form k contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties about its prospects for the future 
the statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements usually are accompanied by words such as optimistic  outlook  believe  estimate  potential  project  expect  anticipate  plan  predict  could  should  may  likely  or similar words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
these statements are based on judgments the company believes are reasonable  however  elkcorp s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences could include  but are not limited to changes in demand  prices  raw material costs  transportation costs  changes in economic conditions of the various markets the company serves  changes in the amount and severity of inclement weather  actions of competitors  new and planned facilities not meeting expected productivity rates and projected financial results  and technological changes  together with other risks detailed herein 
the company s building products business is substantially non cyclical  but can be affected by weather  the availability of financing  insurance claims paying practices  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the asphalt roofing products manufacturing business is highly competitive 
actions of competitors  including changes in pricing  or slowing demand for asphalt roofing products due to general or industry economic conditions or the amount of inclement weather could result in decreased demand for the company s products  lower prices received or reduced utilization of plant facilities 
further  changes in building and insurance codes and other standards from time to time can cause changes in demand  or increases in costs that may not be passed through to customers 
in the building products business  the significant raw materials are ceramic coated granules  asphalt  glass fibers  resins and mineral filler 
increased costs of raw materials can result in reduced margins  as can higher energy  trucking and rail costs 
historically  the company has been able to pass some of the higher raw material  energy and transportation costs through to the customer 
should the company be unable to recover higher raw material  energy and or transportation costs from price increases of its products  operating results could be adversely affected and or lower than projected 
temporary shortages or disruption in supply of raw materials or transportation do result from time to time from a variety of causes 
if the company experiences temporary shortages or disruption of supply of raw materials  operating results could be adversely affected and or lower than projected 
the company has been involved in a significant expansion plan over the past several years  including the construction of new facilities and the expansion of existing facilities 
progress in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies and financial results is difficult to predict for new and expanded plant facilities 
if such progress is slower than anticipated  or if demand for products produced at new or expanded plants does not meet current expectations  operating results could be adversely affected 
certain facilities of the company s subsidiaries must utilize hazardous materials in their production process 
as a result  the company could incur costs for remediation activities at its facilities or off site  and other related exposures from time to time in excess of established reserves for such activities 
the company s litigation is subject to inherent and case specific uncertainty 
the outcome of such litigation depends on numerous interrelated factors  many of which cannot be predicted 
although the company currently anticipates that most of its needs for new capital in the near future will be met with internally generated funds or borrowings under its available credit facilities  significant increases in interest rates could substantially affect its borrowing costs or its cost of alternative sources of capital 
each of the company s businesses  especially cybershield s business  is subject to the risks of technological changes and competition that is based on technology improvement or labor savings 
these factors could affect the demand for or the relative cost of the company s technology  products and services  or the method and profitability of the method of distribution or delivery of such technology  products and services 
in addition  the company s businesses each could suffer significant setbacks in revenues and operating income if it lost one or more of its largest customers  or if its customers plans and or markets should change significantly 
cybershield has lost substantial business as a result of most cellular handset production moving to asia where cybershield has no significant presence 
low labor costs in asia make other coating processes competitive with those cybershield would use 
cybershield s future viability may depend on the successful commercialization of the exact process  or other value added services  which are unproven as yet on a large commercial scale 
although the company insures itself against physical loss to its manufacturing facilities  including business interruption losses  natural or other disasters and accidents  including but not limited to fire  earthquake  damaging winds  and explosions  operating results could be adversely affected if any of its manufacturing facilities became inoperable for an extended period of time due to these or other events  including but not limited to acts of god  war or terrorism 
each of the company s businesses is actively involved in the development of new products  processes and services which are expected to contribute to the company s ongoing long term growth and earnings 
products using versashield fire retardant coatings have not yet produced significant commercial sales 
its market potential may be dependent on the stringency of federal and state regulatory requirements  which are difficult to predict 
if such development activities are not successful  regulatory requirements are less stringent than currently predicted  market demand is less than expected  or the company cannot provide the requisite financial and other resources to successfully commercialize such developments  the growth of future sales and earnings may be adversely affected 
parties are cautioned not to rely on any such forward looking beliefs or judgments in making investment decisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in its operations  the company is exposed to financial  market  political and economic risks 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding the company s exposure to the risks of changing commodity prices and interest rates
