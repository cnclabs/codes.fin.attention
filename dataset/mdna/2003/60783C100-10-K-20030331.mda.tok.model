capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  and  the majority of expenditures were as a result of expanding production capacity at the company s various facilities 
management believes that the company s existing product lines and manufacturing capacity will enable the company to generate sufficient cash through operations  supplemented by the company s bank line of credit  to finance the company s business over the next twelve months 
however  additional cash resources may be required if the company s rate of growth exceeds currently anticipated levels 
moreover  it may prove necessary for the company to construct or acquire additional manufacturing facilities in order for the company to compete effectively in new market areas or states which are beyond a mile radius from one of its production facilities 
the construction or acquisition of new facilities could require significant additional capital 
for these reasons  among others  the company may need additional debt or equity financing in the future 
there can be  however  no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such additional financing  or that any such financing will be available on terms acceptable to it 
commitments and contingencies the following table represents a comprehensive list of the company s contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by year amounts in thousands total thereafter long term debt      operating leases        total contractual cash obligations        use of estimates and critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions including those related the company s most critical accounting policies 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
changes in economic conditions could have an impact on these estimates and the company s actual results 
management believes that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity allowances for contract adjustments the company maintains allowances for contract adjustments that result from the inability of its customers to make their required payments 
management bases its allowances through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collection trends  and an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
revenue recognition on construction contracts contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting and  therefore  take into account the costs  estimated earnings and revenue to date on contracts not yet completed 
revenue recognized is that percentage of the total contract price that cost expended to date bears to anticipated final total cost  based on current estimates of costs to complete 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
management has not assessed whether the application of this standard will have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
this statement eliminates the automatic classification of gain or loss on extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item of income and requires that such gain or loss be evaluated for extraordinary classification under the criteria of accounting principles board no 
reporting results of operations 
this statement also requires sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions  and makes various other technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
the company is required to adopt sfas for the year ending december  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of such costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operations  plant closings or other exit or disposal activities 
sfas is effective prospectively for exit and disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier application encouraged 
as the provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively after adoption date  the company cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of sfas will have on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others the interpretation  which addresses the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
at december   the company has no such guarantees 
on december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements in sfas no 
for stock based compensation for annual periods ending after december  and for interim periods beginning after december   including those companies that continue to recognize stock based compensation under apb opinion no

provides three alternative transition methods for companies that choose to adopt the fair value measurement provisions of sfas no 
for a complete explanation on the valuation of our stock based compensation consistent with the method prescribed by sfas no 
 please refer to note to the financial statements included in our annual report for fiscal year ended december  the company believes that there has not been a material impact to the company upon adoption of sfas no 
other than the disclosure requirements 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin which requires extensive disclosures including certain disclosures that are applicable to december  financial statements and will require companies to evaluate variable interest entities to determine whether to apply the consolidation provisions of fin to those entities 
companies must apply fin to entities with which they are involved if the entity s equity has specified characteristics 
if it is reasonably possible that a company will have a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity at the date fin s consolidation requirements become effective  the company must disclose the nature  purpose  size and activities of the variable interest entity and the consolidated enterprise s maximum exposure to loss resulting from its involvement with the variable interest entity in all financial statements issued after january  including december  financial statements regardless of when the variable interest entity was created 
we believe the consolidation provisions of fin  if applicable  would apply to variable interest entities created after january  immediately  and to variable interest entities created before february  in our interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
seasonality historically  the company s quarterly revenues have been highest in the second and third quarters of each calendar year because a large number of orders for modular classrooms placed by school districts require that classrooms be constructed  delivered and installed in time for the upcoming new school year which generally commences in september 
the company has typically been able to add employees as needed to respond to the corresponding increases in manufacturing output required by such seasonality to meet currently foreseeable increases in this seasonal demand 
the company s first and fourth quarter revenues are typically lower due to greater number of holidays and days of inclement weather during such periods 
in addition  the company s operating margins may vary on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of revenues between standardized classrooms and higher margin customized classrooms and the timing of the completion of large  higher margin customized contracts 
inflation during the past three years  the company has not been adversely affected by inflation  because it has been generally able to pass along to its customers increases in the costs of labor and materials 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuation in interest rates on our million credit facility 
during  we did not use interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the carrying value of the credit facility approximates fair value as the interest rate is variable and resets frequently 
indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest at libor plus additional interest of between and  or the federal funds rate plus additional interest of between to 
the additional interest charge is based upon certain financial ratios 
we estimate that the average amount of debt outstanding under the credit facility for will be million 
therefore  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of  for the year
