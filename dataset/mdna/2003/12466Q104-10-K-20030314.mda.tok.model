critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents an amount that  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
management s judgment in determining the adequacy of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans while taking into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions which may affect a borrower s ability to repay  overall portfolio quality  and review of specific potential losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
impaired loans impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the corporation considers a loan impaired when it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
a loan is not considered impaired during a period of delay in payment if the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due is expected 
a valuation allowance is maintained to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment 
valuation of derivatives the corporation enters into commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding ie  rate lock commitments 
rate lock commitments on mortgage loans that are intended to be sold are considered to be derivatives 
the period of time between issuance of a loan commitment and closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from to days 
for such rate lock commitments  the corporation protects itself from changes in interest rates through the use of best efforts forward delivery commitments  whereby an investor commits to buy the loan at the time the borrower commits to an interest rate with the intent that the investor has assumed the interest rate risk on the loan 

table of contents the corporation does not hold any derivative instruments in its securities portfolio nor has it entered into any derivative hedging transactions

the prime rate remained steady at for most of until it was reduced to in november while interest rates on mortgage loans are not directly tied to the prime rate  mortgage interest rates have generally followed the decline in the prime interest rate

table of contents asset quality allowance and provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an amount that  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the following table presents the corporation s loan loss experience for the periods indicated table allowance for loan losses year ended december  dollars in thousands allowance  beginning of period provision for loan losses retail banking and mortgage banking consumer finance total provision for loan losses loans charged off real estate residential mortgage real estate construction commercial  financial and agricultural consumer consumer finance total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off real estate residential mortgage commercial  financial and agricultural consumer consumer finance total recoveries net loans charged off acquisition of moore loans allowance  end of period ratio of net charge offs to average total loans outstanding during period for consumer finance ratio of net charge offs to average total loans outstanding during period excluding consumer finance in  the provision for loan losses was million compared to  in and loans charged off during totaled million compared to  in and  in recoveries totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
in addition  the allowance increased million in connection with the acquisition of moore loans on september  the increase in the provision was a result of the increase in net loan charge offs in and an increase in non performing assets 
the increase in the provision and net charge offs was a result of the acquisition of moore loans 
the corporation conducts an analysis of the loan portfolio on a regular basis 
this analysis is used in assessing the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses and in the determination of the necessary provision for loan losses 
the review process generally begins with loan officers identifying problem loans to be reviewed on an individual basis for impairment 
in addition to these loans  all commercial loans are considered for individual impairment testing 
impairment testing includes consideration of the current collateral value of the loan  as well as 
table of contents any known internal or external factors that may affect collectibility 
when a loan has been identified as impaired  a specific allowance may be established based on the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed fair value 
the loans meeting the criteria for special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss  as well as impaired loans  are segregated from performing loans within the portfolio 
loans are then grouped by loan type eg  commercial  consumer and by risk rating eg  substandard  doubtful 
each loan type is assigned an allowance factor based on the associated risk  complexity and size of the individual loans within the particular loan category 
classified loans are assigned a higher allowance factor than non rated loans within a particular loan type due to management s concerns regarding collectibility or management s knowledge of particular elements surrounding the borrower 
allowance factors increase with the severity of classification 
allowance factors used for unclassified loans are based on management s analysis of charge off history and management s judgment based on the overall analysis of the lending environment including the general economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses is the aggregate of specific allowances  the calculated allowance required for classified loans by category and the general allowance for each portfolio type 
in conjunction with the methodology described above  management considers the following risk elements that are inherent in the loan portfolio residential real estate loans and equity lines of credit carry risks associated with the continued credit worthiness of the borrower and changes in the value of the collateral 
construction loans carry risks that the project will not be finished according to schedule  the project will not be finished according to budget and the value of the collateral may at any point in time be less than the principal amount of the loan 
construction loans also bear the risk that the general contractor  who may or may not be a bank loan customer  is unable to finish the construction project as planned because of financial pressure unrelated to the project 
commercial real estate loans may carry risks associated with the successful operation of a business or a real estate project  in addition to other risks associated with the ownership of real estate because the repayment of these loans may be dependent upon the profitability and cash flows of the business or property commercial business loans carry risks associated with the successful operation of a business  which is usually the source of loan repayment  and the value of the collateral  which may depreciate over time and cannot be appraised with as much precision as residential real estate 
consumer loans carry risks associated with the continued credit worthiness of the borrower and the value of the collateral eg  rapidly depreciable assets such as automobiles  or lack thereof 
consumer loans are more likely than real estate loans to be immediately adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 

table of contents the allocation of the allowance at december for the years indicated and the ratio of related outstanding loan balances to total loans are as follows table allocation of allowance loan losses dollars in thousands allocation of allowance for loan losses  end of year real estate residential mortgage real estate construction commercial  financial and agricultural equity lines consumer consumer finance unallocated balance  december ratio of loans to total year end loans real estate mortgage real estate construction commercial  financial and agricultural equity lines consumer consumer finance non performing assets non performing assets of the combined retail and mortgage banking segment  as shown in table  increased to million at december  from million at december  the corresponding allowance for loan losses was million at december  and million at december  the allowance approximates and of total loans outstanding at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in non performing assets was a result of certain lending relationships being put on non accrual status and an increase in real estate owned 
the corporation is closely monitoring these relationships and believes the collateral securing the non accrual loans and the loss allowances related to these loans are adequate 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation foreclosed on two properties 
these properties are currently being marketed and management believes the properties will be sold for not less than the current carrying value 
over the past several years  the corporation has substantially increased its portfolio of commercial loans 
while the corporation continues to increase its commercial loan portfolio  the portfolio also continues to become more seasoned  allowing management to better assess the risk associated with the portfolio 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
as shown in table  the allowance for loan losses at the consumer finance segment was million at december  dealer reserves at december  were million 
dealer reserves are established at the time a loan is made and are specific to an individual dealer 
at the time a loan is made  a reserve for the specific dealer is credited for of future interest payments 
loans charged off at moore loans are first charged to the dealer reserves  to the extent that an individual dealer has reserves  and the remainder is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
dealer reserves are a liability of moore loans and payable to individual dealers upon the termination of the relationship with moore loans and the payment of outstanding loans associated with a specific dealer 

table of contents during periods of economic slowdown or recession  delinquencies  defaults  repossessions and losses generally increase at the consumer finance segment 
these periods also may be accompanied by decreased consumer demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding loans  which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default 
significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic recession may also depress the prices at which repossessed automobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales 
because moore loans focuses on non prime borrowers  the actual rates of delinquencies  defaults  repossessions and losses on these loans are higher than those experienced in the general automobile finance industry and could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn 
while moore loans seeks to manage the higher risk inherent in loans made to non prime borrowers through underwriting criteria and collection methods it employs  no assurance can be given that these criteria or methods will afford adequate protection against these risks 
however  management believes that the current allowance for loan losses and dealer reserves are adequate to absorb any losses on existing loans in the consumer finance segment that may become uncollectible 
loans at the retail banking  mortgage banking and consumer finance segments are generally placed on non accrual status when the collection of principal or interest is ninety days or more past due  or earlier  if collection is uncertain based on an evaluation of the net realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower 
loans greater than ninety days past due may remain on accrual status if management determines it has adequate collateral to cover the principal and interest 
for those loans  which are carried on non accrual status  interest is recognized on the cash basis 
at the consumer finance segment  automobiles securing the loans are generally repossessed after a loan becomes more than days delinquent 
repossessions are handled by independent repossession firms engaged by moore loans and must be approved by a collections officer 
upon repossession and after any prescribed waiting period  the repossessed automobile is sold at auction 
moore loans does not sell any vehicles on a retail basis 
the proceeds from the sale of the automobile at auction  and any other recoveries  are credited against the balance of the loan 
auction proceeds from the sale of the repossessed vehicle and other recoveries are usually not sufficient to cover the outstanding balance of the loan  and the resulting deficiency is charged off 
the charge off represents the difference between the actual net sales proceeds and the amount of the delinquent loan  including accrued interest 
moore loans pursues collection of deficiencies when it deems such action to be appropriate 
for those loans  which are carried on non accrual status  interest is recognized on the cash basis 
  and  in additional gross interest income would have been recorded if non accrual loans had been current throughout the period outstanding for  and  respectively 
interest income received on non accrual loans was   and  for the periods ended december   and  respectively 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the corporation considers a loan impaired when it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
a loan is not considered impaired during a period of delay in payment if the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due is expected 
a valuation allowance is maintained to the extent that the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment 
the balances of impaired loans at december  and  were million and million  respectively  with no specific valuation allowance associated with these loans

residential mortgage lending held for sale c f mortgage s guidelines for underwriting conventional conforming loans comply with the underwriting criteria established by fannie mae and or freddie mac 
the guidelines for conventional non conforming loans are based on the requirements of private investors and information provided by third party investors 
the guidelines used by c f mortgage to originate fha insured and va guaranteed loans comply with the criteria established by hud and the va 
the conventional loans that c f mortgage originates or purchases that have loan to value ratios greater than at origination are generally covered by private mortgage insurance 
the borrower pays the cost of the insurance 
residential mortgage lending held for investment the bank originates residential mortgage loans secured by properties located in its primary market area in southeastern virginia 
the bank offers various types of residential mortgage loans in addition to traditional long term  fixed rate loans 
such loans include and year amortizing mortgage loans with fixed rates of interest and fixed rate mortgage loans with terms of years but subject to call after five  seven or ten years at the option of the bank 
the bank underwrites the loans on terms consistent with preexisting secondary mortgage market standards 
loans associated with residential mortgage lending are included in the real estate residential mortgage category in table construction lending the bank has an active construction lending program 
the bank makes loans primarily for the construction of one to four family residences and  to a lesser extent  multi family dwellings 
the bank also makes construction loans for office and warehouse facilities and other nonresidential projects generally limited to borrowers that present other business opportunities for the bank 
the amounts  interest rates and terms for construction loans vary  depending upon market conditions  the size and complexity of the project  and the financial strength of the borrower and the guarantors of the loan 
the term for the bank s typical construction loan ranges from to months for the construction of an individual residence and from months to a maximum of three years for larger residential or commercial projects 
the bank does not typically amortize its construction loans  and the borrower pays interest monthly on the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
the bank s construction loans generally have a floating or variable prime rate of interest plus a margin but occasionally have a fixed interest rate 
the bank does not generally finance the construction of commercial real estate projects built on a speculative basis 
for residential builder loans  the bank limits the number of models and or speculative units allowed depending on market conditions  the builder s financial strength and track record  and other factors 
generally  the maximum loan to value ratio for one to four family residential construction loans is of the property s fair market value  or of the property s fair market value if the property will be the borrower s primary residence 
the fair market value of a project is determined on the basis of an appraisal of the project usually conducted by an independent  outside appraiser acceptable to the bank 
for larger projects where unit absorption or leasing is a concern  the bank may also obtain a feasibility study or other acceptable information from the borrower or other sources about the likely disposition of the property following the completion of construction 

table of contents construction loans for nonresidential projects and multi unit residential projects are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk to the bank than residential mortgage loans 
the bank attempts to minimize such risks by making construction loans in accordance with the bank s underwriting standards to established customers in its primary market area and by monitoring the quality  progress  and cost of construction 
the maximum loan to value ratio established by the bank for non residential projects and multi unit residential projects is  however  this maximum can be waived for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis 
loans associated with construction lending are included in the real estate construction category in table consumer lot lending consumer lot loans are loans made to individuals for the purpose of acquiring an unimproved building site for the construction of a residence to be occupied by the borrower 
consumer lot loans are made only to individual borrowers  and each borrower generally must certify to the bank his intention to build and occupy a single family residence on his lot generally within three or five years of the date of origination of the loan 
these loans typically have a maximum term of either three or five years with a balloon payment of the entire balance of the loan being due in full at the end of the initial term 
the interest rate for these loans is usually a fixed rate that is slightly higher than prevailing fixed rates for one to four family residential mortgage loans 
management does not view consumer lot loans as bearing as much risk as land acquisition and development loans because such loans are not made for the construction of residences for immediate resale  are not made to developers and builders  and are not concentrated in any one subdivision or community 
loans associated with consumer lot lending are included in the real estate construction category in table commercial real estate lending the bank s commercial real estate loans are primarily secured by the value of real property and the income arising from such property 
the proceeds of commercial real estate loans are generally used by the borrower to finance or refinance the cost of acquiring and or improving a commercial property 
the properties that typically secure these loans are office and warehouse facilities  hotels  retail facilities  restaurants and other commercial properties 
the bank s present policy is generally to restrict the making of commercial real estate loans to borrowers who will occupy or use the financed property in connection with their normal business operations 
however  the bank will also consider making commercial real estate loans under the following two conditions 
first  the bank will consider making commercial real estate loans for other purposes if the borrower is in strong financial condition and presents a substantial business opportunity for the bank 
second  the bank will consider making commercial real estate loans to creditworthy borrowers who have substantially pre leased the improvements to recognized credit quality tenants 
generally  such loans require full amortization over a lesser term than the normal twenty five year amortization period 
commercial real estate loans are usually amortized over a period of time ranging from fifteen years to twenty five years and usually have a term to maturity ranging from five years to fifteen years 
these loans normally have provisions for interest rate adjustments generally after the loan is three to five years old 
the bank s maximum loan to value ratio for a commercial real estate loan is  however  this maximum can be waived for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis 
most commercial real estate loans are further secured by one or more unconditional personal guarantees 

table of contents in recent years  the bank has structured many of its commercial real estate loans as mini permanent loans 
the amortization period  term  and interest rates for these loans vary based on borrower preferences and the bank s assessment of the loan and the degree of risk involved 
if the borrower prefers a fixed rate of interest  the bank usually offers a loan with a fixed rate of interest for a term of three to five years with an amortization period of up to twenty five years 
the remaining balance of the loan is due and payable in a single balloon payment at the end of the initial term 
additionally  the bank offers a fixed rate of interest for up to fifteen years for loans that fully amortize during the fifteen year term 
if the borrower prefers a variable or floating rate of interest  the bank usually offers a loan with an interest rate indexed to the bank s prime rate plus a margin for a term of five years with the remaining balance of the loan due and payable in a single balloon payment at the end of five years 
management of the bank believes that shorter maturities for commercial real estate loans are necessary to give the bank some protection from changes in the borrower s business and income as well as changes in general economic conditions 
in the case of fixed rate commercial real estate loans  shorter maturities also provide the bank with an opportunity to adjust the interest rate on this type of interest earning asset in accordance with the bank s asset liability management strategies 
loans secured by commercial real estate are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are usually dependent on successful operation or management of the properties securing such loans  repayment of such loans is subject to changes in both general and local economic conditions and the borrower s business and income 
as a result  events beyond the control of the bank  such as a downturn in the local economy  could adversely affect the performance of the bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio 
the bank seeks to minimize these risks by lending to established customers and generally restricting its commercial real estate loans to its primary market area 
emphasis is placed on the income producing characteristics and capacity of the collateral 
loans associated with commercial real estate lending are included in the commercial  financial and agricultural category in table land acquisition and development lending land acquisition and development loans are loans made to builders and developers for the purpose of acquiring unimproved land to be developed for residential building sites  residential housing subdivisions  multi family dwellings  and a variety of commercial uses 
the bank s present policy is to make land acquisition loans to borrowers for the purpose of acquiring developed lots for single family  townhouse or condominium construction 
the bank will also make land acquisition and development loans to residential builders  experienced developers and others in strong financial condition in order to provide additional construction and mortgage lending opportunities for the bank 
land acquisition and development loans are underwritten and processed by the bank in much the same manner as commercial construction loans and commercial real estate loans 
the bank uses a lower loan to value ratio for these types of loans  which is a maximum of for unimproved land and for developed lots for single family or townhouse construction of the discounted appraised value of the property as determined in accordance with the bank s appraisal policies 
the maximum loan to value ratio can be waived for particularly strong borrowers on an exception basis 
the term of land acquisition and development loans ranges from a maximum of two years for loans relating to the acquisition of unimproved land to generally  a maximum of three years for other types of projects 
all land acquisition and development loans are generally further secured by one 
table of contents or more unconditional personal guarantees 
because these loans are usually in a larger amount and involve more risk than consumer lot loans  the bank carefully evaluates the borrower s assumptions and projections about market conditions and absorption rates in the community in which the property is located and the borrower s ability to carry the loan if the borrower s assumptions prove inaccurate 
loans associated with land acquisition and development lending are included in the commercial  financial and agricultural category in table commercial business lending commercial business loan products include revolving lines of credit to provide working capital  term loans to finance the purchase of vehicles and equipment  letters of credit to guarantee payment and performance  and other commercial loans 
in general  all of these credit facilities carry the unconditional guaranty of owners stockholders 
revolving and operating lines of credit are typically secured by all current assets of the borrower  provide for the acceleration of repayment upon any event of default  are monitored monthly or quarterly to ensure compliance with loan covenants  and are re underwritten or renewed annually 
interest rates generally will float at a spread tied to the bank s prime lending rate 
term loans are generally advanced for the purchase of  and are secured by  vehicles and equipment and are normally fully amortized over a term of from two to five years  on either a fixed or floating rate basis 
loans associated with commercial business lending are included in the commercial  financial and agricultural category in table home equity and second mortgage lending the bank offers its customers home equity lines of credit and second mortgage loans that enable customers to borrow funds secured by the equity in their homes 
currently  home equity lines of credit are offered with adjustable rates of interest that are generally priced at the prime lending rate plus a spread 
second mortgage loans are offered with fixed and adjustable rates 
call option provisions are included in the loan documents for some longer term  fixed rate second mortgage loans  and these provisions allow the bank to make interest rate adjustments for such loans 
second mortgage loans are granted for a fixed period of time  usually between five and twenty years  and home equity lines of credit are made on an open end  revolving basis 
home equity loans  second mortgage loans  and other consumer loans secured by a personal residence generally do not present as much risk to the bank as other types of consumer loans 
loans associated with home equity and second mortgage lending are included in the equity lines category in table consumer lending the bank offers a variety of consumer loans  including automobile  personal secured and unsecured  credit card  and loans secured by savings accounts or certificates of deposit 
the bank offers consumer loans to its customers because the shorter terms and generally higher interest rates on such loans help the bank maintain a profitable spread between its average loan yield and its cost of funds 

table of contents consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than residential mortgage loans 
consumer loans secured by collateral other than a personal residence generally involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans because of the type and nature of the collateral or  in certain cases  the absence of collateral 
however  the bank believes the higher yields generally earned on such loans compensate for the increased credit risk associated with such loans 
loans associated with consumer lending are included in the consumer category in table subprime automobile lending moore loans has an extensive automobile dealer network from which it buys automobile loan contracts through its branch offices 
branch personnel have a specific credit authority based upon their experience and historical loan portfolio results  as well as established underwriting criteria 
although the credit approval process is decentralized  moore loan s application processing system includes controls designed to ensure that credit decisions comply with its underwriting policies and procedures 
finance contract application packages completed by prospective obligors are received from automobile dealers via facsimile or by telephone 
once the application is received  a credit bureau report is accessed 
moore loan personnel with credit authority review the application package and determine whether to approve the application  approve the application subject to conditions that must be met or deny the application 
the credit decision is based primarily on the applicant s credit history and current employment status 
moore loan s underwriting and collateral guidelines form the basis for the credit decision 
exceptions to credit policies and authorities must be approved by a designated credit officer 
moore loans typical borrowers have experienced prior credit difficulties or have modest income 
because moore loans serves customers who are unable to meet the credit standards imposed by most traditional automobile financing sources  the corporation expects to sustain a higher level of credit losses than traditional automobile financing sources 
however  moore loans generally charges interest at higher rates than those charged by traditional financing sources  the impact of which should more than offset the increase in the provision for loan losses for this segment of the corporation s loan portfolio

these long term borrowings were used to fund the acquisition of moore loans and a portion of the related outstanding loans 
liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits with banks  federal funds sold  securities available for sale  and investments and loans maturing within one year 
as a result of the corporation s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  management believes that the corporation maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and to meet customers credit needs

recent accounting pronouncements in december   the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position  accounting by certain entities including entities with trade receivables that lend to or finance the activities of others  to reconcile and conform the accounting and financial reporting provisions established by various aicpa industry audit guides 
this statement is effective for annual and interim financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and did not have a material impact on the corporation s financial statements 
on march   the financial accounting standards board fasb determined that commitments for the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale must be accounted for as derivatives instruments  effective for fiscal quarters beginning after april  the bank enters into commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding ie  rate lock commitments 
such rate lock commitments on mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market are considered derivatives 
accordingly  these commitments including any fees received from the potential borrower are recorded at fair value in derivative assets or liabilities  with changes in fair value recorded in the net gain or loss on sale of mortgage loans 
fair value is based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements  and for fixed rate commitments also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates 
the cumulative effect of adopting statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  for rate lock commitments as of december  was not material 
the corporation originally adopted sfas on january  in april  the fasb issued statement no 
 rescission of fasb no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
the amendment to fasb statement eliminates an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
sfas also 
table of contents amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the provisions of sfas related to the rescission of statement shall be applied in fiscal years beginning after may  the provisions of sfas related to statement are effective for transactions occurring after may   with early application encouraged 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires recognition of a liability  when incurred  for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity 
the liability should be measured at fair value 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  effective january   the corporation adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
additionally  sfas requires that acquired intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles be separately recognized if the benefit of the asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over their estimated useful life 
branch acquisition transactions were outside the scope of sfas and therefore any intangible asset arising from such transactions remained subject to amortization over their estimated useful life 
in october  the fasb issued statement no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions sfas 
sfas amends previous interpretive guidance on the application of the purchase method of accounting to acquisitions of financial institutions  and requires the application of fasb statement no 
 business combinations  and sfas to branch acquisitions if such transactions meet the definition of a business combination 
the provisions of sfas do not apply to transactions between two or more mutual enterprises 
in addition  sfas amends fasb statement no

the adoption of sfas   and did not  and will not  have a material impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of statement no 
sfas  in december sfas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
finally  sfas amends accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting apb  to require disclosure about the effects of stock options in interim financial information 
the amendments to sfas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the amendments to apb are effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  early application is encouraged for both amendments 
while the corporation complies with the disclosure requirements of sfas as of december  
table of contents  the corporation continues to record stock options under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and has not adopted the alternative methods allowable under sfas effects of inflation the effect of changing prices on financial institutions is typically different from other industries as the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
interest rates are significantly impacted by inflation  but neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes are directly related to price level indices 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the impacts of inflation on interest rates  loan demands  and deposits 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management as the holding company for a commercial bank  the corporation s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuation in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of the corporation s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
since the majority of the corporation s interest earning assets and all of the corporation s interest bearing liabilities are held by the bank  virtually all of the corporation s interest rate risk exposure lies at the bank level 
therefore  management of the bank performs all significant interest rate risk management procedures 
based on the nature of the bank s operations  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the retail banking loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in the virginia counties of king william  king and queen  hanover  henrico  chesterfield  middlesex  new kent  charles city  york  and james city  and is  therefore  subject to risks associated with the local economy 
the consumer finance loan portfolio is concentrated primarily in eastern  central and southwest virginia and portions of eastern tennessee and is  therefore  subject to risks associated with the local economy 
as of december   the corporation does not own any trading assets nor does it have any hedging transactions in place such as interest rate swaps or caps 
the corporation enters into commitments to originate residential mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding ie  rate lock commitments 
such rate lock commitments on mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market are considered to be derivatives 
the period of time between issuance of a loan commitment and closing and sale of the loan generally ranges from to days 
the corporation protects itself from changes in interest rates through the use of best efforts forward delivery commitments  whereby the corporation commits to sell a loan at the time the borrower commits to an interest rate with the intent that the buyer has assumed interest rate risk on the loan 
as a result  the corporation is not exposed to losses nor will it realize gains related to its rate lock commitments due to changes in interest rates 
the bank s interest rate management strategy is designed to stabilize net interest income and preserve capital 
the bank manages interest rate risk through the use of a simulation model that measures the sensitivity of future net interest income and the net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
in addition  the bank monitors interest rate sensitivity through analysis  measuring the terms to maturity or next repricing date of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the matching of the maturities of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s 
table of contents interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based on certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based on certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that same time period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing within that same time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in a decrease in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
in a declining interest rate environment  an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected  absent the effect of other factors  to experience a greater decrease in the cost of its liabilities relative to the yield of its assets and thus an increase in the institution s net interest income  whereas an institution with a positive gap would be expected to experience the opposite result 
certain shortcomings are inherent in any method of analysis used to estimate a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
the analysis is based at a given point in time and does not take into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities also may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
the interest rates on loans with call features may or may not change depending on their interest rates relative to market interest rates 
the corporation is also subject to prepayment risk  particularly in falling interest rate environments or in environments where the slope of the yield curve is relatively flat or negative 
such changes in the interest rate environment can cause substantial changes in the level of prepayments of loans  which may also affect the corporation s interest rate sensitivity gap position 
the methodologies used for interest rate management estimate various rates of withdrawal for money market deposits  savings  and checking accounts  which may vary significantly from actual experience 
as part of its borrowings  the corporation may utilize  from time to time  daily  convertible  fixed and adjustable rate advances from the fhlb 
convertible advances generally provide for a fixed rate of interest for a portion of the term of the advance  an ability for the fhlb to convert the advance from a fixed rate to an adjustable rate at some predetermined time during the remaining term of the advance the conversion feature  and a concurrent opportunity for the corporation to prepay the advance with no prepayment penalty in the event the fhlb elects to exercise the conversion feature 
the interest rates paid on borrowings with convertible features may or may not change depending on their interest rates relative to market interest rates 
also as part of its borrowings and in conjunction with the moore loans purchase  the corporation has adjustable rate and fixed rate borrowing relationships with third party banks and subordinated fixed rate debt with the previous owners of moore loans 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   that are subject to repricing or that mature in each of the time periods shown 
additionally  loans  securities  and borrowings with call or convertible provisions are included in the period in which they may first be called 
except as stated above  the amount of assets and liabilities shown that reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the asset or liability

the corporation believes that the assumptions utilized are reasonable 
the expected maturity date values for loans were calculated by adjusting the instruments contractual maturity date for expectations of prepayments  as set forth in the notes 
similarly  expected maturity date values for interest bearing core deposits were calculated based on estimates of the period over which the deposits would be outstanding  as set forth in the notes 
from a risk management perspective  however  the corporation utilizes both maturity and repricing dates  as opposed to solely using expected maturity dates as shown in the following schedule 
as shown in the table  there have been no significant changes in the maturities of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities as compared to other than for overall growth 
in particular  the acquisition of moore loans has resulted in a large increase in fixed rate loans and borrowings 
the increase in loans held for sale maturing within one year is a result of increased production at c f mortgage 
all loans originated at c f mortgage are usually sold within one month of loan closing 
the decrease in the yield on variable rate loans and deposits  including certificates of deposits  is a result of the decrease in interest rates through and the increase in the yield on fixed rate loans is the result of the acquisition of moore loans 
the rate charged on loans at moore loans is higher due to the inherent risk of its loan portfolio 
the increase in the rate on borrowings is a result of an increase in long term borrowings resulting from the acquisition of moore loans
