item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a reconciliation of funds from operations to net income  which is calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following should be read in conjunction with the information presented in selected financial data and the financial statements and notes thereto  all of which are included herein 
when used in this form k  the words believes  expects  intends  anticipates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from those expressed  expected or implied by the forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from management s estimates and expectations are contained in our filings with the securities and exchange commission and as set forth in the section below entitled potential factors affecting future operating results 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements since they only reflect information available as of the date of this filing 
we do not undertake to update forward looking information contained herein or elsewhere to reflect actual results  changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such forward looking information 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgments and estimates such as those related to valuation of real estate investments  income recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred assets  and qualification as a real estate investment trust reit 
these estimates are made and evaluated on an on going basis using information that is currently available as well as various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 
real estate investments real estate investments are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the cost of real estate includes purchase price  other acquisition costs  and costs to develop properties which include interest and real estate taxes 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value or prolong the useful life of the property are expensed 
expenditures for asset replacements or significant improvements that extend the life or increase the property s value are capitalized 
real estate properties are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate an impairment of a property  we will recognize a loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the property 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts base rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective lease agreements 
differences between rental income recognized and amounts contractually due under the lease agreements are credited or charged  as applicable  to rent receivable 
the amount of straight line rent receivable is charged against income upon early termination of a lease or as a reduction of gain on sale of the property 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments  which results in a reduction to income 
management determines the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual tenant receivables considering the tenant s financial condition  security deposits  letters of credit  lease guarantees and current economic conditi ons 
deferred assets costs incurred for debt financing and property leasing are capitalized as deferred assets 
deferred loan costs include amounts paid to lenders and others to obtain financing 
such costs are amortized over the term of the related loan 
amortization of deferred financing costs is included in interest expense in our statements of income 
deferred leasing costs include leasing commissions that are amortized using the straight line method over the term of the related lease 
deferred leasing costs are included with the basis when a property is sold and therefore reduce the gain on sale 
unamortized financing and leasing costs are charged to expense in the event of debt prepayment or early termination of the lease 
qualification as a reit if we were to fail to qualify as a reit  we would be  among other things  required to provide for federal income taxes on our income and reduce the level of distributions made to our stockholders 
restatement the financial statements for and have been restated as explained in note of the accompanying financial statements 
management s discussion and analysis below compares the results to the restated results  and the restated results to the restated results

gain on sales of real estate investments  net in the fourth quarter of  we sold two industrial properties in denver  colorado  an industrial property in tempe  arizona  and an office property in tucson  arizona for net sale prices totaling  which resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately  in the first quarter  we sold an industrial property in san jose  california and two industrial properties in beaverton  oregon for net sale prices totaling  which resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately  in the second quarter  we sold an industrial property in san diego  california for a net sale price of  which resulted in a gain of approximately  in the third quarter  we sold three office properties  ten industrial properties  and a

in the fourth quarter  we sold an office property in overland park  kansas  an office property in austin  texas  and an industrial property in farmers branch  texas  which included acres of land

common stock dividends to stockholders and distributions to op unitholders declared were per share or op unit for the first and second quarters of  and for the third and fourth quarters 
consistent with our policy  dividends and distributions were paid in the quarter following the quarter in which they were declared 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we expect to fund the cost of acquisitions  capital expenditures  costs associated with lease renewals and reletting of space  repayment of indebtedness  share repurchases  development of properties  and dividends from cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and  if available  other indebtedness which may include indebtedness assumed in acquisitions  and the sale of certain real estate investments 
cash flows our cash and cash equivalents decreased to  at december   from  at december  this decrease is due to  used by investing activities  offset by  of cash provided by operations and  provided by financing activities 
net cash of  used by investing activities consisted of  of cash used for investments in real estate  offset by proceeds from the sale of eight operating properties of  investments in real estate consisted of  invested in acquired properties and  invested in developed properties and improvements to our existing operating portfolio 
investments in real estate include the cost of land  buildings  building improvements  and tenant improvements 
we expect to incur capital expenditures for our current portfolio of approximately  for the year net cash of  provided by operating activities consisted primarily of  of net income and  of adjustments for non cash items  offset by  used in working capital and other activities 
net cash used in working capital and other activities resulted from expenditures incurred in acquiring other assets and payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by an increase in other liabilities 
net cash provided by financing activities of  consisted of net proceeds from bank borrowings and mortgage loans of  and net proceeds from stock options exercised by employees and directors of  offset by repayments of bank borrowings and mortgage loans of  prepaid loan fees of  for loans expected to close in future quarters  payment of dividends and distributions of  the repurchase of  shares of our common stock for  and the redemption of  shares of op units for  in cash 
debt financing our ability to continue to finance operations is subject to several uncertainties 
for example  our ability to obtain mortgage loans on income producing property is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain tenants and the economics of the various markets in which the properties are located  as well as the willingness of mortgage lending institutions to make loans secured by real property 
approximately of our real estate investments served as collateral for our existing indebtedness as of december  our ability to sell real estate investments is partially dependent upon the ability of purchasers to obtain financing at reasonable commercial rates 
in may  we renewed our revolving credit facility with a bank group led by bank of america 
the facility  which matures on june   consists of a million secured line with an accordion feature that allows us at our option to expand the facility to million  if needed 
interest on the facility is at a floating rate equal to either the lender s prime rate or libor plus a margin ranging from to depending on our leverage level 
in september  we obtained an additional million unsecured bridge facility with a six month term  two three month options to extend  and an interest rate of libor plus 
as of december   the facilities had a total outstanding balance of  and an effective interest rate of 
in october  we obtained a  new mortgage from nationwide life insurance company 
the loan has a nine year term and carries a fixed interest rate of for the first three years  with resets at the end of years three and six at the prevailing market rate 
at the time of each reset  we have the option to pay off the loan without penalty 
proceeds from the loan were used to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance of our million line of credit 
mortgage loans payable at december  consist of the following in thousands lender maturity date interest rate as of december  balance prudential insurance march  union bank november  union bank january  tiaa cref june  security life of denver insurance company august  security life of denver insurance company august  nationwide life insurance november  prudential insurance july  prudential insurance july  tiaa cref december  tiaa cref june  tiaa cref june  washington mutual august  total floating rate based on libor plus 
the libor rate was locked for one year at and will expire on december  floating rate based on month libor plus with a minimum rate of adjusted quarterly 
floating rate based on day libor plus adjusted monthly 
floating rate based on a month average of us treasury security yields plus adjusted semi annually 
we were in compliance with the various covenants and other requirements of our debt financing instruments during the year ended december  we anticipate that the cash flow generated by our real estate investments and funds available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands amount of commitment expiring by period less than year years years over years total bank loan payable mortgage loans payable construction contract commitments standby letters of credit total related party transactions our activities relating to the acquisition of new properties  sales of real estate  development of real property  and financing arrangements were previously performed by bedford acquisitions  inc bai  a corporation wholly owned by mr 
peter bedford  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
we used the services of bai for our acquisition  disposition  financing and development activities because we incurred expenses related only to those transactions that were successfully completed 
these services were provided pursuant to written agreements renewable annually since january   which provided that bai was obligated to provide services to us with respect to our acquisition  disposition  financing and development activities  and that bai was responsible for the payment of expenses incurred for these activities 
 bai was required to submit to us a cost estimate for our approval relating to each activity  setting forth the estimated timing and amount of all projected bai costs relating to such activities 
pursuant to the agreement  mr 
bedford was obligated to pay bai s expenses described above if bai failed to make any such payments in a timely fashion  provided that mr 
bedford was not obligated to pay any such amounts exceeding million or following a termination of bai s obligations based on the expiration or termination of the term of the agreement 
on august   we announced that effective july   we terminated the agreement with bai and hired its former employees 
this arrangement provided that bai earned a success fee in an amount equal to of the purchase price of property acquisitions  of the sale price of dispositions  up to of the amount of any loans secured less third party commissions  and up to of the development costs incurred 
the total amount of such fees payable to bai by us was limited to the lesser of i the aggregate amount of such fees earned  or ii the aggregate amount of approved expenses not to exceed actual costs incurred by bai through the time of such acquisition  disposition  financing or development activity 
for the twelve months ended december    and  we paid bai an aggregate amount of approximately   and  respectively  for acquisition  disposition  financing  and development activities performed pursuant to this contractual arrangement 
as of december   we had an accrued liability of  for fees earned by bai in excess of the amounts paid to bai by us under the agreement 
as of december   we had a receivable of  for fees paid to bai in excess of approved expenses as of the date the agreement was terminated  which was subsequently paid in january by bai 
we believe that the fees charged under the foregoing arrangements were comparable to those charged by other real estate service entities or other third party service providers under similar arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december    and  we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we were engaged in such relationships 
potential factors affecting future operating results many factors affect our actual financial performance and may cause our future results to be different from past performance or trends 
these factors include the following a significant portion of our base rent is generated by properties in california  and our business could be harmed by an economic downturn in the california real estate market 
as of december   approximately of our total annualized base rent was generated by our properties located in the state of california 
as a result of this geographic concentration  the performance of the commercial real estate markets and the local economies in various areas within california could affect the value of these properties and the rental income from these properties and  in turn  our results of operations 
in addition  the geographic concentration of our properties in california in close proximity to regions known for their seismic activity exposes us to the risk that our operating results could be harmed by a significant earthquake 
future declines in the demand for office and light industrial space in the greater san francisco bay area could harm our results of operations and  consequently  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
approximately of our net operating income was generated by our office properties and flex industrial properties located in the greater san francisco bay area 
as a result  our business is somewhat dependent on the condition of the san francisco bay area economy in general and the market for office space in the san francisco bay area  in particular 
the market for such space in the san francisco bay area is in the midst of one of the most severe downturns of the past several decades 
this downturn has been precipitated by the unprecedented collapse of many technology and so called dot com businesses  which during the past several years had been chiefly responsible for generating demand for and increased prices of local office properties 
in the event this downturn continues or economic conditions in the san francisco bay area worsen  it could harm the market value of our properties  the results derived therefrom  and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
real estate investments are inherently risky  and many of the risks involved are beyond our ability to control 
real property investments are subject to numerous risks 
the yields available from an equity investment in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and costs incurred by the related properties 
if properties in which we invest do not generate sufficient income to meet costs  including debt service  tenant improvements  third party leasing commissions and capital expenditures  our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could suffer 
revenues and values of our properties may also be harmed by a number of other factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the national economic climate  the local economic climate  local real estate conditions  such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in an area  the attractiveness of our properties to tenants  competition from other available space  our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance to cover other operating costs  government regulations and changes in real estate  zoning or tax laws  interest rate levels  and the availability of financing and potential liabilities under environmental and other laws 
we have in the past  and may in the future  have tenants who are delinquent in their rental payments  which in the aggregate may adversely affect financial performance 
historically  we have had tenants leasing space in our properties who occasionally have been delinquent in their payments 
although we have devoted significant resources to try to minimize these delinquencies  as recently as december approximately of our current month rental payments were collected more than days past their due date 
as substantially all of our income is derived from rental income from real property  our results of operations and ability to make distributions to stockholders would suffer if a number of our tenants or one or more of our significant tenants were unable to meet their obligations to us on a timely basis 
in addition  if the rental rates upon reletting or renewal of leases were significantly lower than current rates  or if we were unable to lease a significant amount of space on economically f avorable terms  or at all  our results of operations could suffer 
we could experience a reduction in rental income if we are unable to renew or relet space on expiring leases on current lease terms  or at all 
as of december   leases representing   and of our total annualized base rent were scheduled to expire during    and  respectively 
we are subject to the risk that  upon expiration  some of these or other leases will not be renewed  the space may not be relet  or the terms of renewal or reletting  including the costs of required renovations or concessions to tenants  may be less favorable than current lease terms 
we could face difficulty in reletting our space on commercially acceptable terms when it becomes available 
in addition  we expect to incur costs in making improvements or repairs to our properties required by new or renewing tenants and expenses associated with brokerage commissions payable in connection with the reletting of space 
similarly  our rental income could be reduced b y vacancies resulting from lease expirations or by construction of tenant improvements required by renewing or new tenants 
if we are unable to promptly renew leases or relet space or to fund expenses relating to tenant turnover  or if the expenses relating to tenant turnover are greater than expected  our financial results could be harmed 
our leases with our largest tenants generated approximately of our base rent in the twelve months of  and the loss of one or more of these tenants could adversely affect our results of operations 
as of december   our largest tenants accounted for approximately of our total annualized base rent 
if we were to lose any one or more of these tenants  or if any one or more of these tenants were to declare bankruptcy or to fail to make rental payments when due  our results of operations could be harmed and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be compromised 
if our tenants experience financial difficulty or seek the protection of bankruptcy laws  our funds from operations could suffer 
our commercial tenants may  from time to time  experience downturns in their business operations and finances due to adverse economic conditions  which may result in their failure to make rental payments to us on a timely basis or at all 
missed rental payments  in the aggregate  could impair our funds from operations and subsequently  our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
at any time  a tenant could seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  which might result in the modification or termination of such tenant s lease and cause a reduction in our cash flow 
during the twelve months ended december   five of our tenants  representing less than of our base rent  filed for bankruptcy 
in the event of default by or bankruptcy of a tenant  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as lessor and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
the default  bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may have an adverse effect on us and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
any failure of our tenants to affirm their leases following bankruptcy could reduce our funds from operations 
our dependence on smaller businesses to rent office space could adversely affect our cash flow 
many of the tenants in our properties operate smaller businesses that may not have the financial strength of larger corporate tenants 
smaller companies generally experience a higher rate of failure and are generally more susceptible to financial risks than large  well capitalized enterprises 
dependence on these companies could create a higher risk of tenant defaults  turnover and bankruptcies  which could harm our ability to pay dividends 
the acquisition and development of real estate is subject to numerous risks  and the cost of bringing any acquired property to standards for its intended market position could exceed our estimates 
we may acquire industrial and suburban office properties and portfolios of these properties  which may include the acquisition of other companies and business entities owning the properties 
although we engage in due diligence review for each new acquisition  we may not be aware of all potential liabilities and problems associated with a property 
we may have limited contractual recourse  or no contractual recourse  against the sellers of a property 
in the future  we expect the majority of our properties and portfolios of properties to be acquired on an as is basis  with limited recourse against the sellers 
in addition  our investments may fail to perform in accordance with our expectations 
further  estimates of the costs of improvements to bring an acquired property up to standards established for the market position intended for that property may prove inaccurate 
to the extent that we acquire properties with substantial vacancies  as we have in the past  we may be unable to lease vacant space in a timely manner or at all  and the costs of obtaining tenants  including tenant improvements  lease concessions and brokerage commissions  could prove more costly than anticipated 
real estate development is subject to other risks  including the following the risks of difficult and complicated construction projects  the risks related to the use of contractors and subcontractors to perform all construction activities  the risk of development delays  unanticipated increases in construction costs  environmental issues and regulatory approvals  and financial risks relating to financing and construction loan difficulties 
additionally  the time frame required for development  construction and lease up of these properties means that we may have to wait a few years or more for a significant cash return to be realized 
our uninsured or underinsured losses could result in a loss in value of our properties 
we currently maintain general liability coverage with primary limits of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate  as well as million of umbrella excess liability coverage 
this coverage protects us against liability claims as well as the cost of legal defense 
we carry property all risks insurance of million on a replacement value basis covering both the cost of direct physical damage and the loss of rental income 
separate flood and earthquake insurance is provided with an annual aggregate limit of million  subject to a deductible of of total insurable value per building and respective rent loss with respect to earthquake coverage 
additional excess earthquake coverage with an aggregate limit of million is provided for property located in california  as well as additional excess eart hquake insurance with an aggregate limit of million for property located in washington 
some losses such as those due to acts of war  nuclear accidents  pollution  mold  or terrorism may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
however  we do presently carry insurance for such terrorism losses as defined under the terrorism risk insurance act of the act under our all risk property policies  liability policies  primary and umbrella excess 
in addition  non certified terrorism coverage is provided under our property policy for losses in excess of million up to the million limit 
in addition  some losses could exceed the limits of our insurance policies or could cause us to bear a substantial portion of those losses due to deductibles under those policies 
if we suffer an uninsured loss  we could lose both our invested capital in and anticipated cash flow from the property while being obligated to repay any outstanding indebtedness incurred to acquire the property 
in addition  a majority of our properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity 
although we have obtained earthquake insurance policies for all of our properties  if one or more properties sustain damage as a result of an earthquake  we may incur substantial losses up to the amount of the deductible under the earthquake policy and  additionally  to the extent that the damage exceeds the policy s maximum coverage 
altho ugh we have obtained owner s title insurance policies for each of our properties  the title insurance may be in an amount less than the current market value of some of the properties 
if a title defect results in a loss that exceeds insured limits  we could lose all or part of our investment in  and anticipated gains  if any  from the property 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pay dividends regularly although we have done so in the past 
our ability to pay dividends in the future is dependent on our ability to operate profitably and to generate cash from our operations 
although we have done so in the past  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends on a regular quarterly basis in the future 
further  any new shares of common stock issued will substantially increase the cash required to continue to pay cash dividends at current levels 
any common stock or preferred stock that may in the future be issued to finance acquisitions  upon exercise of stock options or otherwise  would have a similar effect 
in addition  our existing credit facility limits our ability to pay quarterly dividends to stockholders 
our ability to pay dividends is further limited by the requirements of maryland law 
our ability to pay dividends on the common stock is further limited by the laws of maryland 
under the maryland general corporation law the mgcl  a maryland corporation may not make a distribution if  after giving effect to such distribution  either i the corporation would not be able to pay indebtedness of the corporation as such indebtedness becomes due in the usual course of business or ii the corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of the corporation s total liabilities plus unless the corporation s charter provides otherwise  which our charter does with respect to dividends but does not with respect to distributions by redemption or other acquisition of shares or otherwise the amount that would be needed  if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of distribution  to satisfy the preferent ial rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution 
accordingly  we cannot make a distribution  except by dividend  on our common stock if  after giving effect to the distribution  our total assets would be less than the sum of our liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of the holders of any shares of preferred stock then outstanding if we were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution 
if we fail to maintain our qualification as a reit  we could experience adverse tax and other consequences  including the loss of deductibility of dividends in calculating our taxable income and the imposition of federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
we have elected to qualify as a reit under sections to of the internal revenue code the code 
we believe that we have satisfied the reit qualification requirements since however  the irs could challenge our reit qualification for taxable years still subject to audit and we may fail to qualify as a reit in the future 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex tax code provisions  and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may have an impact on our ability to maintain our qualification as a reit 
for example  in order to qualify as a reit  at least of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least of our reit taxable income  excluding net capital gains 
in addition  we cannot assure you that new legislation  treasury regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to our qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
we are not aware of any proposal to amend the tax laws that would significantly and adversely affect our ability to continue to operate as a reit 
if we fail to maintain our qualification as a reit  or are found not to have qualified as a reit for any prior year  we would not be entitled to deduct dividends paid to our stockholders and would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
in addition  unless entitled to statutory relief  we would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
this treatment would reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of any additional tax liability for the year or years involved 
in addition  we would no longer be required by the code to make any distributions 
as a result  disqualification as a reit would adversely affect us and our abi lity to make distributions to our stockholders 
to the extent that distributions to stockholders have been made in anticipation of our qualification as a reit  we might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate investments to pay the applicable tax 
we must comply with strict income distribution requirements to maintain favorable tax treatment as a reit 
if our cash flow is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and the distribution requirements  we may need to incur additional borrowings or otherwise obtain funds to satisfy these requirements 
to maintain reit status  we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least of our taxable income  excluding net capital gains 
in addition  we are subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income and of our capital gain net income for the calendar year plus any amount of such income not distributed in prior years 
although we anticipate that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses and meet the distribution requirements  we cannot assure you that this will occur and we may need to incur borrowings or otherwise obtain funds to satisfy the distribution requirements associated with maintaining the reit qualification 
in addition  differences in timing between th e receipt of income and payment of expenses in arriving at our taxable income could require us to incur borrowings or otherwise obtain funds to meet the distribution requirements necessary to maintain qualification as a reit 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to borrow funds or otherwise obtain funds if and when necessary to satisfy these requirements 
as a reit  we are subject to complex constructive ownership rules that limit any holder to of our outstanding stock 
any shares transferred in violation of this rule are subject to redemption by us and any such transaction is voidable 
to maintain reit qualification  our charter provides that no holder is permitted to own more than in value of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  no holder is permitted to own any shares of any class of our stock if that ownership would cause more than in value of our outstanding stock to be owned by five or fewer individuals  would result in our stock being beneficially owned by less than persons or would otherwise result in our failure to qualify as a reit 
acquisition or ownership of our stock in violation of these restrictions results in automatic transfer of the stock to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary or  under specified circumstances  the violative transfer may be deemed void or we may choose to redeem the violative shares 
peter b 
bedford is subject to higher ownership limitations than o ur other stockholders 
specifically  mr 
bedford is not permitted to own more than of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
the constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause common stock owned beneficially or constructively by a group of related individuals and or entities to be constructively owned by one individual or entity 
as a result  the acquisition of less than of our outstanding common stock or the acquisition of an interest in an entity which owns our common stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to constructively own common stock in excess of the limits and subject that stock to the ownership restrictions in our charter 
we rely on the services of our key personnel  particularly our chief executive officer  and their knowledge of our business and expertise would be difficult to replace 
we are highly dependent on the efforts of our senior officers  and in particular peter b 
bedford  our chairman and chief executive officer 
while we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could harm our business 
in addition  our credit facility provides that it is an event of default if mr 
bedford ceases for any reason to be our chairman or chief executive officer and a replacement reasonably satisfactory to the lenders has not been appointed by our board of directors within six months 
we have entered into an amended employment agreement with mr 
bedford pursuant to which he will serve as chairman of the board and chief executive officer on a substantially full time basis until the agreement is terminated by the board of directors 
the commercial real estate industry is highly competitive  and we compete with substantially larger companies  including reits  for the acquisition  development and operation of properties  and we may not be able to compete effectively with other properties to attract tenants 
many real estate companies  including other reits  compete with us in making bids to acquire new properties 
many of these companies are larger and have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher purchase price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid  or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all 
numerous industrial and suburban office properties compete with our properties in attracting tenants 
some of these competing properties are newer  better located or better capitalized than our properties 
many of our investments are located in markets that have a significant supply of available space  resulting in intense competition for tenants and lower rents 
we believe the oversupply of available space relative to deman d is likely to increase in the near to intermediate term due to the softening us economy 
the number of competitive properties in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease space in the properties or at newly acquired or developed properties 
we could incur costs from environmental liabilities even though we did not cause  contribute to  or know about them 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner or operator of real estate may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances released on  above  under or in a property 
these laws often impose liability regardless of whether the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  environmental laws often impose liability on a previous owner of property for hazardous or toxic substances present during the prior ownership period 
a transfer of the property may not relieve an owner of all liability 
accordingly  we could be liable for properties and joint venture interests previously sold or otherwise divested 
the costs of removal or remediation could be substantial 
additionally  the presence of t he substances  or the failure to properly remove them  may harm our ability to borrow using the real estate as collateral 
all of our properties have had phase i environmental site assessments  which involve inspection without soil sampling or groundwater analysis  by independent environmental consultants and have been inspected for hazardous materials as part of our acquisition inspections 
none of the phase i assessments has revealed any environmental problems requiring material costs for clean up 
the phase i assessment for milpitas town center  however  indicates that the groundwater under that property either has been or may in the future be  impacted by the migration of contaminants originating off site 
according to information available to us  the responsible party for this offsite source has been identified and has begun clean up 
we do not believe that this environmental matter will impair the future value of milpitas town center in any signif icant respect  or that we will be required to fund any portion of the cost of remediation  although we cannot assure you that these phase i assessments or our inspections have revealed all environmental liabilities and problems relating to our properties 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local laws regarding hazardous or toxic substances 
to date  compliance with federal  state and local environmental protection regulations has not had a material effect on us 
however  we cannot assure you that costs of investigating and remediating environmental matters for properties currently or previously owned by us  or properties which we may acquire in the future  or other expenditures or liabilities including claims by private parties resulting from hazardous substances present in  on  under or above the properties or resulting from circumstances or other actions or claims relating to environmental matters  will not harm us and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
we could incur unanticipated costs to comply with the americans with disabilities act  and any non compliance could result in fines 
under the americans with disabilities act the ada  all public accommodations and commercial facilities are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with the ada requires removal of access barriers  and any non compliance may result in the imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants 
although we believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with these requirements  we may in the future incur costs to comply with the ada with respect to both existing properties and properties acquired in the future  which could have an adverse effect on our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
we are subject to numerous federal  state and local regulatory requirements  and any changes to existing regulations or new laws may result in significant  unanticipated costs 
our properties are  and any properties we may acquire in the future will be  subject to various other federal  state and local regulatory requirements including local building codes 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants 
we believe that our properties are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements  although expenditures at properties owned by us may be necessary to comply with changes in these laws 
although no material expenditures are contemplated at this time to comply with any laws or regulations  we cannot assure you that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed that would require significant unanticipated expenditures by us  which cou ld harm us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
similarly  changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on our properties could result in significant unanticipated expenditures 
our million credit agreement and some of our mortgage loans are collateralized by approximately of our total real estate assets  and in the event of default under these debt instruments  our lenders could foreclose on the collateral securing this indebtedness 
as of december   our million credit facility had an outstanding balance of million and we had other floating rate loans and a million bridge facility totaling million 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at a floating rate and we may from time to time incur or assume other indebtedness also bearing interest at a floating rate 
in that regard  our results of operations for the last year have benefited from low levels of interest rates that are currently at or near historic lows 
should this trend in interest rates reverse itself  our operating results would be harmed 
as of december   our million credit facility was secured by mortgages on properties that accounted for approximately of our annualized base rent  along with the rental proceeds from such properties 
as of december   these properties comprised approximately of our total real estate assets 
while the million bridge facility is unsecured  we have assigned all sale or refinancing proceeds on four properties that account for approximately of our annualized base rent and of our total real estate assets 
in addition  our fixed rate mortgage loans were in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million as of december  all of our mortgage loans were collateralized by properties that accounted for approximately of our annualized base rent and approximately of our total real estate assets 
if we fail to meet our obligations under the credit facility  the mortgage loans  or any other debt instruments we may enter into from time to time  including failure to comply with financial covenants  the holders of this indebtedness generally would be entitled to demand immediate repayment of the principal and to foreclose upon any collateral securing this indebtedness 
in addition  default under or acceleration of any debt instrument could  pursuant to cross default clauses  cause or permit the acceleration of other indebtedness 
any default or acceleration could adversely affect us and jeopardize our qualification as a reit and threaten our continued viability 
our credit facility limits our ability to repurchase and retire shares of our common stock  and the discontinuation of our share buy back program could result in a decrease of our stock price 
since november  we have repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for a total of approximately million  at an average price of per share 
this represents approximately of the shares outstanding since november when we began implementing our share buy back program 
however  our credit facility limits our ability to continue to repurchase such shares by imposing a minimum net worth requirement of million 
as of december   our net worth was approximately million 
if we are forced to discontinue our share buy back program as a result of these limitations  one of the primary drivers behind our historical increases in our stock price will be removed 
we use borrowings to finance the acquisition  development and operation of properties and to repurchase our common stock  and we cannot be certain that financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  in the future 
we borrow money to pay for the acquisition  development and operation of our properties  to repurchase our common stock and for other general corporate purposes 
our credit facility currently expires on june   when the principal amount of all outstanding borrowings must be paid 
since the term of our credit facility is limited  our ability to fund acquisitions and provide funds for working capital and other cash needs following the expiration or utilization of the credit facility will depend primarily on our ability to obtain additional private or public equity or debt financing 
a downturn in the economy could make it difficult for us to borrow money on favorable terms 
if we are unable to borrow  we may need to sell some of our assets at unfavorable prices in order to pay our loans 
we could encounter several problems  including insufficient cash flow necessary to meet required payments of principal and interest  an increase on variable interest rates on indebtedness  and an inability to refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all 
our leverage could harm our ability to operate our business and fulfill our debt obligations 
we have significant debt service obligations 
as of december   we had total liabilities of approximately million  excluding unused commitments under our credit facility  and total stockholders equity of approximately million 
payments to service this debt totaled approximately million during the twelve months of our debt level increases the possibility that we could be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness 
in addition  we may incur additional debt from time to time to fund our stock buy back program  finance strategic acquisitions  investments  joint ventures or for other purposes  subject to the restrictions contained in our indebtedness documents 
an increase in market interest rates could also have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
one of the factors that may influence the market price of the shares of common stock in public markets will be the annual dividend yield on the price paid for shares of common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments 
an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of the common stock to seek a higher annual yield from their investments  which may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
as of december   interest rates in the us were at or near their historic lows 
we have not used derivatives extensively to mitigate our interest rate risks 
historically  we have not used interest rate swaps  caps and floors or other derivative transactions to help us mitigate our interest rate risks because we have determined that the cost of these transactions outweighed their potential benefits and could have  in some cases  jeopardized our status as a reit 
in  we entered into two swap agreements to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates on two mortgages with remaining principal balances totaling approximately million at the date of inception 
these agreements matured on july   and we currently are not involved in any swap agreements 
even if we were to use derivative transactions more extensively  it would not fully insulate us from the prepayment and interest rate risks to which we are exposed 
however  we do not have any policy that prohibits us from usin g derivative transactions or other hedging strategies more extensively in the future 
if we do engage in additional derivative transactions in the future  we cannot assure you that a liquid secondary market will exist for any instruments purchased or sold in those transactions  and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration  which could result in losses 
our board of directors has opted out of the business combination provisions of the mgcl  thereby exempting us from the five year prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements for a business combination with an interested stockholder 
under the mgcl  business combinations  including issuances of equity securities  between a maryland corporation and any person who beneficially owns or more of the voting power of the corporation s shares or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who  at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question  was the beneficial owner of or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock of the corporation an interested stockholder or an affiliate of the interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
a person is not an interested stockholder under the business combination provisions of the mgcl if our board of directors approves in advance the transaction by which the interested stockholder otherwise would have become an interested stockholder 
thereafter  all business combinations must be approved by two supermajority votes of the stockholders unless  among other conditions  the corporation s common stockholders receive a minimum price  as defined in the mgcl  for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its common shares 
however  as permitted by the mgcl  our board of directors has elected to exempt any business combination with any person from these provisions of the mgcl 
consequently  unless this exemption is amended or repealed by our board of directors  the five year prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements imposed by the mgcl will not apply to any business combination between any interested stockholder and us 
as a result  we may enter into business combinations with mr 
bedford or other interested stockholders  without requiring a superm ajority vote or compliance with the other statutory provisions 
the exemption from these provisions may be amended or repealed by our board of directors at any time 
such action by our board of directors would impose the business combination restrictions of the mgcl on interested stockholders  which could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or change in control involving a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interests of the stockholders 
the provisions of our charter documents may inhibit potential acquisition bids that a stockholder may believe are desirable  and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result 
our charter authorizes our board of directors to cause us to issue additional shares of common stock  preferred stock and convertible preferred stock and to set the preferences  conversion or other rights  voting process  restrictions  limitations as to dividends or other distributions  qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock 
in addition  our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of preferred stock and may set the preferences  conversion or other rights  voting powers  restrictions  limitations as to dividends or other distributions  or terms or conditions of redemption of the classified or reclassified shares 
although our board of directors has no current intention to issue any shares of preferred stock  it may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could  depending on their terms  delay  defer or prevent a change in control or other transaction that may be in the best interests of the stockholders 
as a result  these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock from increasing substantially in response to actual or rumored take over attempts 
in addition  these provisions may prevent changes in our management 
we may change our policies without stockholder approval 
our major policies  including those concerning our qualification as a reit and with respect to dividends  acquisitions  debt and investments  are established by our board of directors 
although it has no present intention to do so  the board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies from time to time without a vote of or advance notice to our stockholders 
accordingly  holders of the shares of common stock will have no control over changes in our policies  including any policies relating to the payment of dividends or to maintaining qualification as a reit 
in addition  policy changes could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  the market price of our common stock or our ability to pay dividends 
financial performance we believe funds from operations  or ffo  to be an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity reit 
ffo during the three and twelve months ended december  was  and  respectively 
during the same period in  ffo was  and  respectively 
ffo is used by financial analysts in evaluating reits and can be one measure of a reit s ability to make cash distributions 
presentation of this information provides the reader with an additional measure to compare the performance of reits 
ffo is generally defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  excluding extraordinary items and gains losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we computed ffo in accordance with this definition 
ffo does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
further  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our presentation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we balance our borrowings between fixed and variable rate debt 
while we have entered into interest swap agreements to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average annual interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in thousands twelve month period ending december  thereafter total fair value variable rate libor debt weighted average interest rate fixed rate debt weighted average interest rate as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates
