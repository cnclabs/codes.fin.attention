item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion in this report contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations  and intentions 
such forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement made at the beginning of this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in this section and the section entitled risks relating to our business set forth in part i  item of this report  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
overview we provide services primarily to providers  payors  government agencies  pharmaceutical  biogenetic  and other healthcare organizations in north america  europe  and asia 
we generate substantially all of our revenues from fees for professional services and it outsourcing services 
we typically bill for our services on an hourly  fixed fee  or monthly fixed fee basis as specified by the agreement with a particular client 
in our consulting and systems integration businesses csi  the healthcare and life sciences business units  we establish either standard or target hourly rates for each level of consultant based on several factors including industry and assignment related experience  technical expertise  skills  and knowledge 
for services billed on an hourly basis  fees are determined by multiplying the amount of time expended on each assignment by the project hourly rate for the consultant s assigned to the engagement 
fixed fees  including outsourcing fees  are established on a per assignment or monthly basis and are based on several factors such as the size  scope  complexity and duration of an assignment  the number of our people required to complete the assignment  and the volume of transactions or interactions 
actual hourly or fixed fees for an assignment may vary from the standard  target  or historical rates that we have charged 
revenues are generally recognized related to the level of services performed based upon the amount of time completed on each assignment versus the projected number of hours required to complete such assignment  or the amount of cost incurred on the assignment versus the estimated total cost to complete the assignment 
provisions are made for estimated uncollectible amounts based on our experience 
we may obtain payment in advance of providing services 
these advances are recorded as customer advances and reflected as a liability on our balance sheet 
out of pocket expenses billed and reimbursed by clients are included in total revenues  and then deducted to determine net revenues 
for purposes of analysis  all percentages in this discussion are stated as a percentage of net revenues  since we believe that this is the more relevant measure of our business over time 
cost of services primarily consists of the salaries  bonuses  and related benefits of client serving consultants and outsourcing associates  and subcontractor expenses 
selling expenses primarily consist of the salaries  benefits  travel  and other costs of our sales force  as well as marketing and research expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of the costs attributable to the support of our client serving professionals  such as non billable travel  office space occupancy  information systems  salaries and expenses for executive management  financial accounting and administrative personnel  expenses for firm and business unit governance meetings  recruiting fees  professional development and training  and legal and other professional services 
as associate related costs are relatively fixed in the short term  variations in our revenues and operating results in our csi business can occur as a result of variations in billing margins and utilization rates of our billable associates 
our most significant expenses are our human resource and related salary and benefit expenses 
as of december   approximately of our employees are billable consultants 
another employees form our firm s outsourcing business 
the salaries and benefits of such billable consultants and outsourcing related employees are recognized in our cost of services 
non billable employee salaries and benefits are recognized as a component of either selling or general and administrative expenses 
approximately of our workforce  or employees are classified as non billable 
our cost of services as a percentage of revenues is directly related to several factors  including but not limited to  our consultant utilization  which is the ratio of total billable hours to available hours in a given period  the amount and timing of cost incurred  the billed rate on time and material contracts  or the estimated cost to complete our fixed price contracts 
we evaluate our fixed price contracts on a monthly basis by estimating the cost to complete the assignment 
we then recognize revenues to achieve a constant margin over the remaining term of the engagement 
under our outsourcing contracts  we are required to provide a specified level of services subject to certain performance measurements 
also  our revenue may fluctuate under the contracts based on the volume of transactions we process or other measurements of service provided 
if we incur higher costs to provide the required services  or receive less revenue due to reduced transaction volumes  our gross margin can be negatively impacted 
in our csi business  we manage consultant utilization by monitoring assignment requirements and timetables  available and required skills  and available consultant hours per week and per month 
differences in personnel utilization rates can result from variations in the amount of non billed time  which has historically consisted of training time  vacation time  time lost to illness and inclement weather  and unassigned time 
non billed time also includes time devoted to other necessary and productive activities such as sales support and interviewing prospective employees 
unassigned time results from differences in the timing of the completion of an existing assignment and the beginning of a new assignment 
in order to reduce and limit unassigned time  we actively manage personnel utilization by monitoring and projecting estimated engagement start and completion dates and matching consultant availability with current and projected client requirements 
the number of consultants staffed on an assignment will vary according to the size  complexity  duration  and demands of the assignment 
assignment terminations  completions  inclement weather  and scheduling delays may result in periods in which consultants are not optimally utilized 
an unanticipated termination of a significant assignment or an overall lengthening of the sales cycle could result in a higher than expected number of unassigned consultants and could cause us to experience lower margins 
an unanticipated termination of a major outsourcing contract could result in a significant reduction in revenues 
in addition  expansion into new markets and the hiring of consultants in advance of client assignments have resulted and may continue to result in periods of lower consultant utilization 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenues 
our net revenues increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to two new it outsourcing engagements that commenced in the second quarter of offset by a decline in our healthcare and life sciences work resulting from increased competition and difficult market conditions 
further impacting our life sciences business unit is a significant client engagement which will be substantially completed in march if we do not obtain new engagements and or follow up work from this or other clients  we could see a further revenue decline in our life sciences business unit 
our total revenues decreased to million for the year ended december   a decrease of from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower reimbursable expenses for our healthcare and life sciences businesses resulting from the declines in their revenues  which require the most travel 
partially offsetting this decline is the increase in net revenues 
cost of services 
cost of services increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to an increase in the outsourcing staff and subcontractors related to additional outsourcing contracts  partially offset by a decline in the number of consultants in the healthcare and life sciences business units

revenues related to the major subcontracting relationships were million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
gross profit

this data has been derived from unaudited financial statements that  in the opinion of our management  include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our annual audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto

our quarterly operating results may vary significantly in the future depending on a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors may include the reduction in size  delay in commencement  interruption  or termination of one or more significant engagements or assignments  fluctuations in consultant hiring and utilization  the loss of personnel  the loss of one or more significant clients  the unpredictability of engaging new clients and additional assignments from existing clients  increased competition  timing and collection of fees and payments  write offs of client billings  consolidation of  and subsequent reduction in the number of  healthcare providers  pricing pressure  the number  timing  and contractual terms of significant client engagements  market demand for our services  delays or increased expenses incurred in connection with existing assignments  variations in the timing of expenses  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  changes in our business strategies  variability in the number of business days within a quarter  the timing of certain general and administrative expenses and international currency fluctuations 
due to the foregoing factors  quarterly revenues and operating results are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
in particular  the timing between initial client contract and fulfillment of the criteria necessary for revenue recognition can be lengthy and unpredictable  and revenues in any given quarter can be materially adversely affected as a result of such unpredictability 
business practices of clients  such as deferring commitments on new assignments until after the end of fiscal periods  could require us to maintain a significant number of under utilized consultants  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we typically experience a lower number of billable days in certain quarters of the year  particularly the fourth quarter when we encourage our employees to take vacation during the december holidays 
variability in the number of billable days may also result from other factors such as vacation days  sick time  paid and unpaid leave  inclement weather  and holidays  all of which could produce variability in our revenues and costs 
in the event of any downturn in potential clients businesses or the economy in general  planned utilization of our services may be deferred or canceled  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
based on the preceding factors  we may experience a shortfall in revenues or earnings from expected levels or otherwise fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or the market in general  which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   we generated cash flow from operations of million and used approximately million to acquire a controlling interest in codigent solutions group  inc  now known as fcg infrastructure services  inc fcgis see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements and approximately million to purchase property and equipment  including computer and related equipment and office furniture 
at december   we had cash and marketable investments available for sale of million compared to million at december  we have a revolving line of credit  under which we are allowed to borrow up to million at an interest rate of the prevailing prime rate with an expiration date of may  there was no outstanding balance under the line of credit at december  management believes that our existing cash and investments together with funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating requirements for the next twelve months 
our cash and investments are available for capital expenditures which are budgeted at million for  strategic investments  mergers and acquisitions  and other potential large scale cash needs that may arise  including approximately million in cash that will be disbursed on or subsequent to january to purchase the remaining shares of fcgis that we do not already own see note i of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in february  we acquired paragon solutions  inc  a us based provider of onshore and offshore software development services for approximately million  of which approximately million was paid in shares of restricted fcg common stock and the remainder was paid in cash 
we assumed approximately million of paragon s debt which we paid in full in connection with the acquisition 
also  in february  we acquired certain assets of phyve corporation  a provider of information security and connectivity software solutions  for million in cash 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these policies are more fully described in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  cost to complete client engagements  valuation of goodwill and long lived and intangible assets  accrued liabilities  income taxes  restructuring costs  idle facilities  litigation and disputes  and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from our estimates and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward looking information 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and unbilled receivables revenues are derived from consulting  system integration  and it outsourcing services 
revenues are recognized on a time and materials  level of effort  or percentage of completion basis 
before revenues are recognized  the following four criteria must be met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services rendered  c the fee is fixed and determinable  and d collectibility is reasonably assured 
we determine if the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured based on our judgments regarding the nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
arrangements range in length from less than one year to seven years 
the longer term arrangements are generally level of effort or fixed price arrangements 
revenues from time and materials arrangements are generally recognized based upon contracted hourly billing rates as the work progresses 
revenues from level of effort arrangements are based upon a fixed price for the level or resources provided 
revenues from fixed fee arrangements are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
we maintain  for each of our fixed fee contracts  estimates of total revenue and cost over the respective contract term 
for purposes of periodic financial reporting on the percentage of completion contracts  we accumulate total actual costs incurred to date under the contract 
the ratio of those actual costs to our then current estimate of total costs for the life of the contract is then applied to our then current estimate of total revenues for the life of the contract to determine the portion of total estimated revenues that should be recognized 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
revenues recognized on fixed price contracts are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  do not complete our projects within the planned periods of time  or do not satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then profit may be significantly and negatively affected or losses may need to be recognized 
revisions in our contract estimates are reflected in the period in which the determination is made that facts and circumstances dictate a change of estimate 
favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenues recognized  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenues 
provisions for estimated losses on individual contracts are made in the period in which the loss first becomes known 
as discussed below under recent accounting pronouncements  as a result of the issuance of financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force emerging issues task force or eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  we plan to change our method of accounting for revenues from certain fixed price outsourcing contracts in although we have time and materials contracts  level of effort and fixed price contracts  and some contracts with multiple elements  the trend among our clients is increasingly toward fixed price contracts 
some contracts include incentives for achieving either schedule targets  cost targets  or other defined goals 
revenues from incentive type arrangements are recognized when it is probable they will be earned 
as part of our on going operations to provide services to our customers  incidental expenses  which are generally reimbursable under the terms of the contracts  are billed to customers 
these expenses are recorded as both revenues and direct cost of services in accordance with the provisions of eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  and include expenses such as airfare  mileage  hotel stays  out of town meals  and telecommunication charges 
unbilled receivables represent revenues recognized for services performed that were not billed at the balance sheet date 
the majority of these amounts are billed in the subsequent month 
unbilled amounts arising from contracts recognized using percentage of completion accounting occur when revenues recognized exceed allowable billings in accordance with the contractual agreements 
as of december   we had unbillable revenues included in current unbilled receivables of approximately million related to contracts utilizing percentage of completion  which were expected to be billed in the following year 
in addition  we had long term unbilled receivables at december   and december  of million and million  respectively  on a single major outsourcing contract with a term of seven years 
the long term receivable will be billed and collected over the remaining four years of the contract through contractual billings that will exceed the amounts to be earned as revenues 
customer advances comprise payments from customers for which services have not yet been performed or prepayments against work in process 
these unearned revenues are deferred and recognized as future contract costs are incurred and as contract services are rendered 
with regard to amounts billed  allowances for doubtful accounts are provided based on specific identification where less than full recovery of accounts receivable is expected 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
management specifically analyzes account receivables and historical bad debt  customer concentrations  credit worthiness  past collection experience  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of doubtful accounts 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf no 
income statement characterization of reimbursements for out of pocket expenses incurred 
in accordance with the provisions of the announcement  we adjusted revenues and cost of services for all periods reported to include out of pocket expenses 
adoption of the provisions of the fasb announcement had no impact on our reported net income loss or earnings loss per share for either the current period or past periods 
effective december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separate from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized  but instead are to be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses accounting and reporting costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period that the liability is incurred 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  titled accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items  and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 
arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent on the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
the new standard is required to be adopted for all new applicable revenue arrangements no later than the third quarter of early adoption is permitted 
alternatively  we are permitted to apply the new standard to all existing arrangements impacted by eitf and record to earnings the resulting cumulative effect as a change in accounting principle 
we are in the process of reviewing the application of eitf to our long term outsourcing contracts 
we plan to apply eitf to our existing outsourcing arrangements as of the first quarter of on the cumulative catch up basis 
we estimate that we will record a charge  net of tax  of up to million  or per share 
this treatment is not a restatement but would be a one time impact in the first quarter of adopting the new accounting standard 
we expect earnings for the first half of to be negatively impacted by to per share before the cumulative effect 
we further expect any negative earnings impact of the new accounting standard to be partially offset by a positive impact to earnings in the second half of thus  the full year impact to earnings related to this new accounting standard  excluding the cumulative effect  is expected to range from neutral to slightly dilutive 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual reports ending after december  at december   we had no guarantees outstanding 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  at this time  we intend to continue to account for stock based compensation to our associates using the methods prescribed by accounting principles bulletin apb opinion no 
 and related interpretations 
we have made certain disclosures required by sfas no 
in note a to our notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin which changes the criteria by which one company includes another entity in its consolidated financial statements 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and apply in the first fiscal period beginning after june   for variable interest entities created prior to february  we have not entered into any transactions or other arrangements which we believe would be considered variable interest entities  and accordingly we expect that the adoption of these provisions will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents ie  short term and long term cash investments  accounts receivable  unbilled receivables  accounts payable  and a revolving line of credit 
only the cash and cash equivalents which total million at december  present us with market risk exposure resulting primarily from changes in interest rates 
based on this balance  a change of one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest income for the annual period of approximately million 
our objective in maintaining these investments is the flexibility obtained in having cash available for payment of accrued liabilities and acquisitions 
our borrowings are primarily dependent upon the prevailing prime rate 
as of december   we had no borrowings under the revolving line of credit and available borrowing capacity of million 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the estimated fair value of borrowings under the revolving line is expected to approximate its carrying value
