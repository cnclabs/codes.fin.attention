critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible receivables  inventory shrinkage  impairment  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for uncollectible receivables the majority of our sales are made to customers that are covered by third party payors  such as insurance companies  government agencies and employers 
we carry receivables that represent the amount owed to us for sales made to customers or employees of those payors that have not yet been paid 
we maintain a reserve for the amount of these receivables deemed to be uncollectible 
this reserve is calculated based upon historical collection activity adjusted for current conditions 
if the financial condition of the payors were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  then an additional reserve would be required 
inventories included in our valuation of inventory are estimates of the losses related to shrinkage  which occurs during periods between physical inventory counts 
when estimating these losses  we considered historical loss results at specific locations as well as overall loss trends 
should actual shrink losses differ from the estimates upon which that our reserves were based  our operating results will be impacted 
impairment we evaluate long lived assets  excluding goodwill  for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment is measured by calculating the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the store  and comparing this amount to the carrying value of the assets 
goodwill impairment in connection with the provisions of sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
our test during the fourth quarter of fiscal resulted in no impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our companies 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
income taxes we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal purposes 
these nols generate a significant deferred tax asset 
however  as a result of a review at june   the company has concluded that  because the company has reached level of profitability and because the company believes the profitability will continue and utilize the remaining nol  a deferred tax asset of  was recorded 
due to the uncertainty of the utilization of the timing differences  the company believes it is more likely than not that the timing differences will not be utilized and a full valuation allowance was provided
