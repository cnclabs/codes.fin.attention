item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this section contains forward looking statements based on current management expectations 
meaningful factors which could cause future results to differ materially from such expectations include  without limitation  the following i results from the company s ongoing clinical trials  ii scientific data collected on the company s technologies currently in preclinical research and development  iii decisions made by the fda or other regulatory bodies with respect to the initiation of human clinical trials  iv decisions made by the fda or other regulatory bodies with respect to approval and commercial sale of any of the company s proposed products  v the commercial acceptance of any products approved for sale and the ability of the company to manufacture  distribute and sell for a profit any products approved for sale  vi the company s ability to obtain the necessary patents and proprietary rights to effectively protect its technologies  and vii the outcome of any collaborations or alliances currently entered into by the company or to be entered into by the company in the future with pharmaceutical or other biotechnology companies 
general description of company the company is a biotechnology company engaged in the research and development of biopharmaceutical products for the diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system  or cns  diseases and for the treatment of some cancers and autoimmune diseases 
at december   the company is considered a development stage enterprise as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no product development altropane is an imaging agent for the diagnosis of parkinsonian syndrome  which we call ps  including parkinson s disease  which we call pd  and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  which we call adhd 
we have completed a phase iii clinical trial for the diagnosis of ps and hope to file a nda with the fda in the first half of we are currently conducting our second phase ii trial of altropane for the diagnosis of adhd in adults using a simplified scanning procedure and algorithm adjustments 
inosine is a nerve growth factor which specifically promotes axon outgrowth in cns cells 
we presently expect to file an ind in late and hope to initiate phase i and ii clinical studies in patients who have suffered strokes shortly thereafter 
troponin i  which we refer to as troponin  is our anti angiogenic agent 
our product development efforts are currently focused on the development of a sufficiently scaled up manufacturing process 
this has been a significant challenge throughout the biotech community for companies developing complex proteins like troponin 
once we finalize our manufacturing process  we plan to complete the remaining pre clinical studies identified by the fda as required for the filing of an ind 
earlier stage product candidates include fluoratec  a second generation imaging agent for the diagnosis of pd and adhd and compounds for the treatment of pd and other central nervous system disorders 
to date  we have not marketed  distributed or sold any products and  with the exception of the altropane imaging agent  all of our technologies and early stage product candidates are in pre clinical development 
our product candidates must undergo a rigorous regulatory approval process which includes extensive pre clinical and clinical testing to demonstrate safety and efficacy before any resulting product can be marketed 
the fda has stringent laboratory and manufacturing standards which must be complied with before we can test our product candidates in people or make them commercially available 
pre clinical testing and clinical trials are lengthy and expensive and the historical rate of failure for product candidates is high 
clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment which is a function of many factors  and delays and difficulties in completing patient enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times 
the foregoing uncertainties and risks limit our ability to estimate the timing and amount of future costs that will be required to complete the clinical development of each program 
in addition  we are unable to estimate when material net cash inflows are expected to commence as a result of the successful completion of one or more of our programs 
however  we do not currently expect to generate revenues from product sales for at least the next twelve months 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and are dominated by larger  more experienced and better capitalized companies 
any delays we encounter in completing our clinical trial programs may adversely impact our competitive position in the markets in which we compete 
such delays may also adversely affect our financial position and liquidity 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to investments and research contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a complete description of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k 
investments our investments consist exclusively of investments in united states agency bonds and corporate debt obligations 
these marketable securities are adjusted to fair value on the consolidated balance sheet through other comprehensive income 
we disclose the value of restricted investments  if any  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
these investments are classified as a current asset because they are highly liquid and are available  as required  to meet working capital and other operating requirements 
research contracts we regularly enter into contracts with third parties to perform research and development activities in connection with our scientific technologies 
costs incurred under these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract which we believe corresponds to the manner in which the work is performed 
results of operations year ended december  and the company s net loss was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  net loss per share totaled per share during as compared with per share during the higher net loss in was primarily due to lower interest income in the decrease in interest income was partially offset by lower research and development expenses in research and development expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the decrease in was primarily attributable to lower manufacturing development costs for troponin of approximately  the decrease in these expenses was partially offset by higher pre clinical costs for inosine of approximately  and higher research and development wages resulting from increased headcount of approximately general and administrative expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to higher professional service costs of approximately  including an increase in non cash expenses of  primarily related to the issuance of warrants to consultants 
the increase in these expenses was partially offset by the absence of approximately  in personnel recruitment costs that were incurred in the period when the company hired a number of senior executives 
other expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was due to non cash charges related to agreements the company entered into in and with significant securityholders to modify outstanding warrants 
in november  the company agreed to extend the expiration date and lower the exercise price of certain warrants in return for the elimination of certain reset provisions with those warrants 
the company recorded a one time charge of approximately  related to this transaction 
during  the company lowered the exercise price of certain warrants held by a securityholder in return for daily trading restrictions on the number of shares of common stock that the securityholder could sell through may  which resulted in a charge of  the other agreement  which resulted in a charge of approximately  in and  delayed a reset of the exercise price of certain warrants held by the securityholder in return for the issuance of additional warrants 
the non cash charges recognized in each transaction were based upon a fair value calculation of the warrants modified or issued in each transaction as determined under the black scholes pricing model 
interest expense totaled  during the year ended december  as compared to zero during the during the year ended december  in july  the company issued million of convertible notes  and incurred  in interest on the coupon   in non cash interest associated with the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the notes and approximately  in amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest income was  during the year ended december  as compared with interest income of  during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower average cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances during the period as compared to the period 
at december   the company had net deferred tax assets of approximately million for which a full valuation allowance has been established 
as a result of its concentrated efforts on research and development  the company has a history of incurring net operating losses and expects to incur additional net operating losses for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the future benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be realized and  therefore  provided a full valuation allowance for these assets 
in the event the company achieves profitability  these deferred tax assets may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and expense 
year ended december  and the company s net loss was  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  net loss per share totaled per share during as compared with per share during the lower net loss in was primarily due to lower research and development expenses in the decrease in these expenditures were partially offset by higher general and administrative and other expenses in research and development expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the decrease in was primarily attributable to expenditures related to the phase iii clinical trial for the altropane imaging agent for the diagnosis of parkinson s disease and the significantly lower initial phase ii clinical trial costs for the altropane imaging agent for the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
the decrease in these expenditures were partially offset by higher product manufacturing costs in the period related to the establishment of a gmp manufacturing process for troponin and higher pre clinical manufacturing scale up costs for inosine 
general and administrative expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with  during the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to higher professional service costs including personnel recruitment costs 
other expenses were  during the year ended december  as compared with zero during the year ended december  the increase in was due to non cash charges related to agreements the company entered into with two significant securityholders to modify outstanding warrants 
one agreement  which resulted in a charge of  lowered the exercise price of certain warrants held by the securityholder in return for daily trading restrictions on the number of shares of common stock that the securityholder could sell through may the other agreement  which resulted in a charge of approximately  in  delayed a reset of the exercise price of certain warrants held by the securityholder in return for the issuance of additional warrants 
the non cash charges recognized in each transaction were based upon a fair value calculation of the warrants modified or issued in each transaction as determined under the black scholes pricing model 
the company recorded an additional non cash charge of approximately  in associated with certain contingently issuable warrants related to the second agreement 
interest income was  during the year ended december  as compared with interest income of  during the year ended december  interest expense was zero in as compared to  in the company issued million of convertible debentures in september that were converted into common stock in february and march liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities  primarily related to our net loss  totaled  in as compared to  in the increase in is primarily related to lower interest income in the decrease in interest income was partially offset by lower research and development expenses in cash provided by investing activities totaled  in as compared to cash used in investing activities of  in the difference in investing activities principally reflects the purchase of short term investments with the proceeds from the private placements  described below  completed by the company in  net of the sales of short term investments which were subsequently used to fund operations 
cash flow from financing activities was  in as compared to zero in the difference in financing activities principally reflects the effect of the private placements  described below  completed by the company in as of december   the company has incurred total net losses since inception of approximately million 
to date  the company has dedicated most of its financial resources to the research and development of its product candidates  preclinical compounds  general and administrative expenses and costs related to obtaining and protecting patents 
since inception  the company has primarily satisfied its working capital requirements from the sale of the company s securities through private placements 
these private placements have included the sale of preferred stock and common stock  as well as notes payable and convertible debentures 
each private placement has included the issuance of warrants to purchase common stock 
a summary of financings completed during the three years ended december  is as follows date net proceeds raised securities issued july million convertible debentures march million common stock june million common stock in the future  the company s working capital and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of the company s research and development activities  the level of resources that the company devotes to the developmental  clinical  and regulatory aspects of its technologies  and the extent to which the company enters into collaborative relationships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
at december   the company had available cash  cash equivalents  and investments of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
the company believes that the cash  cash equivalents  and investments available at december   combined with approximately million in net proceeds raised in a private placement of common stock completed in march  will provide sufficient working capital to meet its anticipated expenditures for more than the next twelve months 
the company may raise additional capital in the future through collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  debt financing and equity offerings 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful or that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
following is information on the direct research and development costs incurred all amounts in thousands on the company s principal scientific technology programs currently under development 
these amounts do not include research and development employee and related overhead costs which total approximately million on a cumulative basis 
program period year to date cumulative diagnostic imaging anti angiogenesis cns regeneration auto immune diseases other three months ended december  estimating costs and time to complete development of a specific program or technology is difficult due to the uncertainties of the development process and the requirements of the fda which could require additional clinical trials or other development and testing 
results of any testing could lead to a decision to change or terminate development of a technology  in which case estimated future costs could change substantially 
in the event the company were to enter into a licensing or other collaborative agreement with a corporate partner involving sharing or funding by such corporate partner of development costs  the estimated development costs incurred by the company could be substantially less than estimated 
additionally  research and development costs are extremely difficult to estimate for early stage technologies due to the fact that there is generally less comprehensive data available for such technologies to determine the development activities that would be required prior to the filing of an nda 
as a result  the company cannot reasonably estimate the cost and the date of completion for any technology that is not at least in phase iii clinical development due to the uncertainty of the number of required trials and size of such trials and the duration of development 
as of december   the company estimates that it will incur approximately  in additional direct research and development costs to complete the preparation and filing of the nda for altropane for the diagnosis of pd 
this estimate does not include research and development employee and related overhead costs 
actual costs and time to complete may differ significantly from the estimates 
the company leases certain office equipment  office space and laboratory space under noncancelable operating leases 
the company s current corporate office lease expires in and contains provisions whereby the company can sublet all or part of the space and fully retain any sublease income generated 
the company also leases laboratory space that expires in may and can be renewed by the company for an additional two year period 
approximate future minimum commitments under the above leases  outstanding debt and contractual  research and development programs  are as follows year ended december  operating lease commitments research and development commitments maturity of debt thereafter in july  the company entered into agreements pursuant to which the company has issued million in principal amount of convertible senior secured promissory notes to a single institutional investor in a private placement 
the notes were issued pursuant to exemptions afforded by section of the securities act and rule of regulation d thereunder 
the notes mature in july and bear interest at per annum  payable semi annually on june and december the company may elect to pay interest on the notes in either cash or  subject to certain limitations  additional notes on the same terms 
pursuant to the company s private placement of common stock completed in march  the notes may be converted into the company s common stock at the option of the holder at a conversion price of per share  subject to anti dilution adjustments 
among other adjustments  unless the investor consents otherwise  if the company issues equity securities in the future for consideration per share of common stock less than the then applicable conversion price of the notes  the conversion price of the notes will be reduced to equal that lower price 
the notes are secured by a first priority security interest and continuing lien on all current and after acquired property of the company 
the company generally may obtain a release of the security interest by providing alternative collateral in the form of either cash or a bank letter of credit 
until the time  if any  that the company provides alternative collateral or less than  principal amount of notes remains outstanding  the agreements also prohibit the company  among other things  from entering into any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets  incurring additional indebtedness  encumbering its assets with any liens and redeeming or paying dividends on any of its capital stock 
the company is permitted to grant licenses or sublicenses of its intellectual property to third parties in the ordinary course of its business free from the security interest  but the holders of the notes will receive a first priority security interest and continuing lien on all amounts owing to the company in respect of any such license or sublicense 
the agreements also contain customary events of default  including any change of control of the company and breach by the company of its representations and warranties and covenants contained in the agreements 
if an event of default were to occur  the company s obligations under the notes could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable in full 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at its fair market value when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fin no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
the interpretation requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee 
the interpretation also requires additional disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued 
the accounting requirements for the initial recognition of guarantees are applicable on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of fin no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of our agreements that we have determined are within the scope of fin no 
as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is for the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of our insurance policy coverage  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
all of these indemnification agreements were grandfathered under the provisions of fin no 
as they were in effect prior to december  accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  we enter into arrangements with certain service providers to perform research  development  and clinical services for us 
under the terms of these arrangements  such service providers may use our technologies in performing their services 
we enter into standard indemnification agreements with those service providers  whereby we indemnify them for any liability associated with their use of our technologies 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we would be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have product liability and general liability policies that enable us to recover a portion  if not all  of any amounts paid 
we have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  we believe that the estimate fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  sfas no 

sfas no 
provides two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
further  the statement requires disclosure of comparable information for all companies regardless of whether  when  or how an entity adopts the preferable  fair value based method of accounting 
these disclosures are now required for interim periods in addition to the traditional annual disclosure 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal periods ending after december  the company has provided the new disclosures in accounting for stock based compensation in note item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we generally maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities which can include including commercial paper  certificates of deposit  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
the fair value of these available for sale securities are subject to changes in market interest rates and may fall in value if market interest rates increase 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help insure liquidity 
we have implemented policies regarding the amount and credit ratings of investments 
due to the conservative nature of these policies  we do not believe we have material exposure due to market risk 
we may not have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore our future operating results or cash flows could be affected if we are required to sell investments during a period in which increases in market interest rates have adversely affected the value of our securities portfolio
