these chemicals which include insecticides  fungicides  molluscicides  growth regulators  and soil fumigants  are marketed in liquid  powder  and granular forms 
amvac s business is continually undergoing an evolutionary change 
years ago amvac considered itself a distributor formulator  but now amvac primarily manufactures  distributes  and formulates its own proprietary products or custom manufactures or formulates for others 
in february  amvac acquired the global pre harvest protection business from pace international  llc pace

in january  amvac acquired the evital g cranberry herbicide business conducted in the united states from syngenta crop protection  inc in july  amvac acquired from flowserve us inc  all of its assets associated with the smartbox closed delivery system 
the smartbox system electronically dispenses granular crop protection products  replacing older technology that utilizes mechanically driven sprockets and chains 
the state of the art smartbox technology allows farmers to apply crop protection products accurately and efficiently while avoiding contact with the product 
the computer controller enables farmers to monitor and change application rates while planting 
table of contents and provides the farmer with a permanent record of application 
amvac assumed a position in the smartbox partnership in at the same time it acquired the fortress corn soil insecticide business from dupont 
that same year  amvac sold its fortress g active ingredient chlorethoxyfoxs corn soil insecticide to the american farmer in the smartbox system 
later that year  amvac secured exclusive marketing rights in the us bayer cropscience s aztec g corn soil insecticide 
by offering both products  amvac provides farmers a choice of two different chemistries to apply through the smartbox system 
this allows farmers to rotate products from year to year  thereby preventing insects from building resistance to any one specific product 
amvac is currently looking at utilizing this system for other crops where the safety features of the system would provide an important benefit 
in july  amvac acquired from syngenta crop protection  inc syngenta all us epa end use product registrations and data support as well as a license to the ambush wp trademark wettable powder formulation insecticide business in the united states

in addition to the product line acquisitions disclosed above  in november  amvac acquired the us dibrom insecticide business from valent usa corporation valent  a wholly owned subsidiary of sumitomo chemical company  limited 
the purchase included all epa registration rights issued under the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra and state registrations of the product line  an extensive data package  inventory  trademarks and all product related intellectual property

the agricultural chemical industry in general is cyclical in nature 
the demand for amvac s products tends to be slightly seasonal 
seasonal usage  however  does not necessarily follow calendar dates  but more closely follows varying growing seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
the company does not believe that backlog is a significant factor in its business 
the company primarily sells its products on the basis of purchase orders  although it has entered into requirements contracts with certain customers 
conagra  inc  agriliance and helena chemical company accounted for  and  respectively of the company s sales in conagra  inc accounted for of the company s sales in conagra  inc  tenkoz and helena chemical accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s sales in conagra  agriliance and helena are distributors of the company s products 
tenkoz is a buying cooperative of various companies 
competition amvac faces competition from many domestic and foreign manufacturers in its marketplaces 
competition in amvac s marketplace is based primarily on efficacy  price  safety and ease of application 
many of such competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than amvac 
amvac s ability to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products and expand its product lines and customer base 
amvac competes principally on the basis of price  the quality of its products and the technical service and support given to its customers 
the inability of amvac to effectively compete in several of amvac s principal products would have a material adverse effect on amvac s results of operations 
generally  the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope  there being more than one way or one product for treatment  eradication  or suppression 
as previously mentioned  the company has attempted to position amvac in smaller niche markets which are no longer of strong focus to larger companies 
these markets are small by nature  require significant and intensive management input  ongoing product research  and are near product maturity 
these types of markets tend not to attract larger chemical companies due to the smaller volume demand  and larger chemical companies have been divesting themselves of products that fall into such niches as is evidenced by amvac s successful acquisitions of dacthal  fortress  dibrom  vapam  bidrin and naa 
amvac s proprietary product formulations are protected  to the extent possible  as trade secrets and  to a lesser extent  by patents and trademarks 
although amvac considers that  in the aggregate  its trademarks  licenses  and patents constitute a valuable asset  it does not regard its business as being materially dependent upon any single or several trademarks  licenses  or patents 
amvac s products also receive protection afforded by the effect of fifra legislation that makes it unlawful to sell any pesticide in the united states unless such pesticide has first been registered by the epa as well as under similar state laws 
substantially all of amvac s products are subject to epa registration and re registration requirements and are conditionally registered in accordance with fifra 
this licensing by epa is based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when it is used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of amvac s products are used require a registration by that specific state before it can be marketed or used 
state registrations are renewed annually  as appropriate 
the epa and state agencies have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on registered products sold by amvac 
amvac  on its own behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  has  and is currently furnishing  certain required data relative to specific products 

table of contents under fifra  the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support us registrations 
this requirement results in operating expenses in such areas as testing and the production of new products 
amvac expensed   and  during  and respectively  related to gathering this information 
based on facts known today  amvac estimates it will spend approximately  in because scientific analyses are constantly improving  it cannot be determined with certainty whether or not new or additional tests may be required by the regulatory authorities 
additionally  while fifra good laboratory practice standards specify the minimum practices and procedures which must be followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity of data related to these tests submitted to the epa  there can be no assurance the epa will not request certain tests studies be repeated 
amvac expenses these costs on an incurred basis 
see also part i  item of this annual report for discussions pertaining to research and development expenses 
raw materials the company utilizes numerous firms as well as internal sources to supply the various raw materials and components used by amvac in manufacturing its products 
many of these materials are readily available from domestic sources 
in those instances where there is a single source of supply or where the source is not domestic  the company seeks to secure its supply by either long term arrangements or advance purchases from its suppliers 
recent increases in energy costs are expected to have an impact on the company 
the ultimate impact  of which  cannot be measured at this time 
the company believes that it is considered to be a valued customer to such sole source suppliers

table of contents corporation  and del monte fresh produce 
the ten named plaintiffs are citizens of four countries guatemala  costa rica  panama  and equador 
the plaintiffs were banana workers and allege that they were exposed to dbcp in applying the product in their native countries 
the case was also filed as a class action on behalf of other workers so exposed in these four countries 
for the last five years  the focus of the case has been on procedural issues 
the defendants moved to dismiss under the doctrine of forum non conveniens 
under this doctrine  the foreign plaintiffs would have to sue in their own countries rather than using the united states courts 
the plaintiffs wish to keep the cases in the united states and have them remanded to state court 
the plaintiffs also contend that the federal court does not have jurisdiction 
in september  the court granted defendants motion to dismiss based on the grounds of forum non conveniens 
a number of conditions were imposed including consent to jurisdiction in the four foreign countries for the ten named plaintiffs  use of discovery taken in the united states  the requirement that the plaintiffs file suits in their home countries by december   and the agreement by defendants to pay any judgment  if any  that might be entered in the foreign countries 
the court order also provided that the plaintiffs could return to the united states if the foreign countries refused to accept jurisdiction

suits in the other countries have not been served 
no discovery has taken place on the individual claims of the plaintiffs 
however  amvac product did not reach two of the four countries involved 
it is too early to provide any evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time 
likewise  it is too early to determine whether the plaintiffs attorneys will attempt to include other banana workers as plaintiffs in this case or somewhere else 
without such discovery  it is unknown whether any of the plaintiffs was exposed to amvac s product or what statute of limitation defense may apply 
the company intends to continue to vigorously contest the cases

amvac intends to contest the cases vigorously 
it is too early to provide an evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time 
d 
texas matters these matters involve an earlier round of litigation by foreign banana workers 
the complaints filed in the united states court of appeals  fifth circuit entitled franklin rodriquez delgado  et al  jorge colindres carcamo  individually and on behalf of all other similarly situated  et al  juan ramon valdez  et al  and isae carcamo v 
shell oil company  et al 
the complaints are for personal injuries from alleged exposure to dbcp 
amvac was not sued by the plaintiffs but was sued on a third party complaint by dow chemical company 
these cases were originally filed in various state courts in texas and removed by the defendants to federal court 
by order dated july   the united states district court granted defendants motion to dismiss pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens  requiring the plaintiffs to sue in their native countries 
the court required the defendants to consent to jurisdiction in the foreign countries along with other conditions 
as amvac had not been sued by the plaintiffs directly  it refused to consent to jurisdiction in the foreign countries for these plaintiffs 
in  dow chemical company dismissed its third party complaint against amvac without prejudice 
subsequently  dow chemical company settled with these plaintiffs as well as with about fifteen thousand other banana workers represented by the plaintiffs law firm 
dow chemical company was then dismissed by the plaintiffs with prejudice in september two intervenors have filed a motion in opposition to this dismissal 
the plaintiffs appealed to the fifth circuit on the order of dismissal under forum non conveniens 
in october  the fifth circuit found federal court jurisdiction and affirmed the dismissals based on forum non conveniens 
the united states supreme court refused to accept a hearing at that time 
the plaintiffs want the court to hear this case if it decides to hear the patrickson case 
while amvac is not presently a party in this lawsuit having been dismissed without prejudice  the case is still pending  with the focus now shifted to the jurisdiction in the foreign countries 

table of contents other matters the company may be  from time to time  involved in other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business 
the results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty 
the company has and will continue to expend resources and incur expenses in connection with these proceedings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these proceedings 
while the company continually evaluates insurance levels for product liability  property damage and other potential areas of risk  an adverse determination in one or more of these proceedings could subject the company to significant liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results

weather patterns can have an impact on the company s operations 
weather conditions influence pest population by impacting gestation cycles for particular pests and the effectiveness of some of the company s products  among other factors 
the end user of some of the company s products may  because of weather patterns  delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting season which may result in a reduction of the use of some of the company s products
