item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unless the context requires otherwise  western wireless  the company  we  our and us include us and our subsidiaries 
overview we provide cellular communications services in western states under the cellularone cellularone and western wireless brand names principally through the ownership and operation of cellular wireless systems 
the operations are primarily in rural areas due to our belief that there are certain strategic advantages to operating in these areas 
we provide wireless services in metropolitan service areas msa and rural service areas rsa 
additionally  we own mhz personal communication services pcs licenses for three basic trading areas btas 
historically  we have provided analog service to our customers and had deployed tdma digital voice channels throughout our network to support our roaming partners 
during we began deploying code division multiple access cdma throughout our network  which allows us to economically expand the minutes of use mou available to our customers and introduce a wide range of consumer based wireless internet related services 
at december   we covered approximately of our licensed population with cdma digital technology 
we own approximately of western wireless international holding corporation wwi 
the balance is owned by bradley horwitz  executive vice president of the company and president of wwi 
wwi  through its consolidated subsidiaries and equity investments  is a provider of wireless communications services in nine countries 
wwi owns controlling interests in six of these countries slovenia  austria  ireland  bolivia  haiti and ghana 
these six entities are consolidated into our financial results 
operations in c te d ivoire  croatia and georgia are accounted for using the equity method 
in the fourth quarter of  wwi sold its majority ownership interest in its icelandic subsidiary and wrote off its investment in c te d ivoire 
us headquarter functions of wwi and majority owned european  south american and caribbean consolidated subsidiaries are recorded as of the date of the financial statements 
our consolidated ghanaian entity and entities accounted for using the equity method are presented on a one quarter lag 
revenues consist primarily of subscriber revenues  roamer revenues  fixed line revenues and equipment sales 
the majority of revenues are derived from subscriber revenues 
subscriber revenues include monthly access charges  charges for airtime used in excess of plan minutes  universal service fund usf subsidy revenues  long distance revenues derived from calls placed by our customers  international prepaid revenues  international interconnect revenues and other charges  such as activations  voice mail  call waiting and call forwarding 
roamer revenues result from providing service to subscribers of other wireless carriers when those subscribers roam into our markets and use our systems to carry their calls 
roaming revenues have historically yielded higher average per minute rates and higher margins than subscriber revenues 
the per minute rate paid by a roamer is established by an agreement between us and the roamer s wireless provider 
fixed line revenues represent non wireless revenues mainly from our fixed line business in austria 
service revenues include subscriber  roamer  fixed line and other revenue 
other revenues consist primarily of revenue related to international long distance and revenue from the licensees of the cellularone group name 
equipment sales consist of wireless handset and accessory sales to customers 
we sell both digital and analog handsets below cost and regard these losses as a cost of building our subscriber base 
cost of service consists mainly of the cost of i providing access to local exchange and long distance carrier facilities  ii maintaining the wireless network  and iii off network roaming costs 
cost of equipment sales consists of the costs related to handset and accessory sales to customers 
cost of equipment sales also includes the cost of handsets related to migrating customers to digital service on a free or discounted basis and the cost of handsets associated with customer retention that occurs with the signing of an extended service agreement 
general and administrative expenses are principally variable costs 
general and administrative costs include administrative costs associated with maintaining subscribers  including customer service and other centralized support functions 
general and administrative expenses also include billing costs  subscriber bad debt  insurance and property taxes 
sales and marketing costs include costs associated with acquiring a subscriber  including direct and indirect sales commissions  salaries  all costs of retail locations and advertising and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing costs do not include the revenue or costs of handset sales 
however  when sales and marketing costs per gross addition are discussed  the revenue and costs from handset sales are included because such measure is commonly used in the wireless industry 
depreciation and amortization expense primarily includes depreciation expense associated with the property and equipment in service and amortization associated with our international wireless licenses 
interest and financing expense includes interest on our consolidated debt 
intercompany interest has been eliminated for consolidation purposes 

table of contents ebitda represents total revenues less total operating expenses exclusive of depreciation  amortization  asset dispositions and stock based compensation for our operations 
we believe ebitda provides meaningful additional information on our performance and on our ability to service our long term debt and other fixed obligations  and to fund our continued growth 
ebitda is considered by many financial analysts to be a meaningful indicator of an entity s ability to meet its future financial obligations  and growth in ebitda is considered to be an indicator of future profitability  especially in a capital intensive industry such as wireless telecommunications 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income loss  as determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as an alternate to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
since all companies do not calculate ebitda in the same manner  our presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have multiple billing cycles all of which span our year end 
this requires management to estimate the amount of subscriber revenue associated with a portion of each bill cycle up to the end of the year 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue can be made 
actual bill cycle results and related revenue may vary  depending on subscriber usage and rate plan mix  from the results estimated at the end of the year 
roamer revenues and incollect cost information is provided to us primarily through a third party centralized clearinghouse 
we receive data from a clearinghouse the middle of each month 
this requires management to estimate roamer revenue and incollect expense up to the end of the year 
management analyzes the most recently available information from the clearinghouse and historical trends to determine the revenue and expense estimates 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the roamer revenue and incollect cost can be made 
actual clearinghouse results and the associated roamer revenue and incollect costs may vary  depending on usage  from the results estimated at the end of the year 
we are invoiced for our access to and usage of local exchange and long distance carrier facilities on multiple billing cycles  which span our year end 
this requires management to estimate the expenses associated with a portion of each bill cycle up to the end of the year 
we use this method since reasonably dependable estimates of these costs can be made 
actual local and long distance expenses may vary  depending on customer usage  from those estimated at the end of the year 
we must make estimates of the collectability of our subscriber accounts receivable 
management analyzes historical write offs  changes in our internal credit policies and customer concentrations when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates or if actual experience differs from estimates 
we assess the impairment of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to anticipated minimum future operating results and a significant change in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business 
when we determine that the carrying value of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we then measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 on january   we ceased amortization of our domestic licenses as we determined that these assets meet the definition of indefinite life intangible assets 
the fair value of our domestic licenses was estimated using the discounted present value of expected future cash flows 
this assessment is performed by combining our individual domestic licenses as a single unit as they are operated in aggregate in such a manner that represents their highest and best use 
in addition  it is unlikely that a significant portion of our individual rsas or msas would be sold on a stand alone basis 
the determination of fair value is a complex consideration that involves significant assumptions and estimates 
assumptions and estimates made by us were based on our best judgments and included among other things i an assessment of market and economic conditions including discount rates  ii future operating strategy and performance  iii competition and market share  and iv the nature and cost of technology utilized 
under sfas no 
 impairment must be assessed at least annually  or when indications of impairment exist  on our domestic licenses 
we have investments in consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated equity investments that are in foreign countries 
these investments are subject to the laws and regulations governing telecommunications services in effect in each of the countries in which they operate 
these laws and regulations can have a significant influence on the results of operations and the value of our investment in these affiliates 
laws and regulations are subject to change by the responsible governmental agencies 
we cannot predict what future laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations 
further  certain of the countries in which we have investments have experienced or may experience political instability 
we assess the impact of significant changes in laws  regulations and political stability on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements when deemed necessary 
in addition  we assess the impairment of our investments whenever major events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be recoverable 
factors we consider which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected operating results  a significant change in the strategy for our overall business or the impact of future laws and regulations of foreign government agencies 

table of contents our subsidiary  wwi  has a stock appreciation rights plan the sar plan 
under the sar plan  selected key employees and agents of wwi may receive performance units  which are rights to receive an amount based upon of the fair market value of wwi 
fair market value is based upon management s estimates at the time  considering various factors and is approved by the board of wwi 
differences may result in the amount and timing of related sar plan expenses if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the countries in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we believe that  based on a number of factors  there is uncertainty regarding the realization of our domestic and foreign net operating loss nol carryforwards 
in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to litigation and contingencies 
we must use our best judgment and estimates of probable outcomes when determining the impact to us and our financial results 
we assess the impact of claims and litigation on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements when deemed necessary 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 
 which clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  relating to consolidation of certain entities 
first  fin no 
will require identification of our participation in variable interests entities vie  which are defined as entities with a level of invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on a standalone basis  or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
then  for entities identified as vie  fin no 
sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to the vie  if any  bears a majority of the exposure to its expected losses  or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns 
fin no 
also sets forth certain disclosures regarding interests in vie that are deemed significant  even if consolidation is not required 
we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our future consolidated financial results 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 
 which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under the fair value based method  compensation cost for stock options is measured when options are issued 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for us starting with the year ended december  we intend to continue to account for stock based employee compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issues to employees  and will provide the additional sfas no 
disclosures required under sfas no 
the interim disclosure provisions are effective for us starting with the quarter ending march  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others fin no 

fin no 
requires the disclosure by the guarantor of certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin no 
also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize at the inception of the guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin no 
does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
fin no 
incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superceded 
fin no 
is to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not anticipate the adoption of fin no 
will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf no 
 addressing the accounting for cash consideration received by a customer from a vendor  including vendor rebates and refunds 
the consensus reached states that consideration received should be presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products or services and should therefore be shown as a reduction of cost of sales in the income statement of the customer 
the provisions of this consensus are applied prospectively and are consistent with our existing accounting policy 
in october  the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 

eitf no 
addresses arrangements with multiple deliverables specifying how the arrangement consideration should be measured  whether the arrangement should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the arrangement should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
eitf no 
is applicable to an arrangement in which some  but not all of its deliverables are within the scope of other existing higher level authoritative literature that does not provide guidance with respect to determining separate units of accounting 
eitf no 
indicates a need for staff accounting bulletin sab no  revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 
 to be modified 
eitf no 
is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact this statement  along with any changes to sab no 
 will have on our future consolidated financial results 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
supersedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  
table of contents in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 opinion no 

applying the provisions of opinion no 
distinguishes transactions that are part of an entity s recurring operations from those that are unusual and infrequent that meet criteria for classification as an extraordinary item 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
during the second quarter of and recognized a gain of million in other income on the repurchase of approximately million of our senior subordinated notes due in and the extraordinary loss of million on early extinguishment of debt in has been reclassified to other income to conform with sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

this statement deals with the costs of closing facilities and removing assets 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
this cost is initially capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the underlying asset 
once the obligation is ultimately settled  any difference between the final cost and the recorded liability is recognized as a gain or loss on disposition 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning january  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents results of domestic operations for the years ended december   and we had  domestic subscribers at december   a increase during we had  domestic subscribers at december   a increase during we had  domestic subscribers at december   a increase in the net number of domestic subscribers added through system acquisitions was approximately  in the following table sets forth certain financial data as it relates to our  and domestic operations year ended december  dollars in thousands revenues subscriber revenues roamer revenues equipment sales other revenues total revenues operating expenses cost of service cost of equipment sales general and administrative sales and marketing depreciation and amortization asset dispositions stock based compensation total operating expenses ebitda domestic revenues the decrease in subscriber revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to a decrease in monthly average revenue per subscriber arpu partially offset by growth in the average number of subscribers 
the increase in subscriber revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to growth in the average number of subscribers partially offset by a decrease in arpu 
arpu was in  a decline from in  which was a decline from in the decline in arpu in both years was the result of several factors including i the increase in popularity of rate plans that have larger allotments of included minutes  ii larger home calling areas  iii more rate plans that include long distance at no additional charge  and iv an increase in the number of rate plans that share minutes with an existing plan at a lower access rate 
we continue to focus on attracting and retaining customers with rate plans that provide more features and included minutes at a higher average recurring access charge 
new rate plans offered in have slowed the decline in arpu and we expect that trend to continue 
we currently receive federal universal service funding as an eligible telecommunications carrier etc for our wireless residential service wrs customers in a number of states 
on september   and again on december   we submitted our requests to receive funding for certain of our traditional mobile services customers that reside in areas in which we are eligible to receive federal universal service funding 
we expect to submit similar requests on a quarterly basis throughout and we believe it is likely that in we will receive most  if not all  of the requested funding  which could exceed million 
however  no long term assurances can be given that federal universal service funding will continue at the current level or at all 
the decrease in roamer revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to a decrease in the rates charged between carriers partially offset by an increase in roaming traffic on our network 
the increase in roamer revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was the result of an increase in roaming traffic on our network  partially offset by a decrease in the rates charged between carriers 
all years presented have shown growth in roamer minutes as a result of our strategy to become the roaming partner of choice for other carriers 
on june   we signed an extension of our roaming agreement  through june   with at t wireless services  inc at t wireless our largest roaming partner  at a lower per minute rate than the prior agreement 
in march  we extended our existing roaming agreement with at t wireless 
the latest extension became effective june  and remains in effect until june  in the first year  the extended agreement provides for lower per minute rates compared to the contractual rates that expired june  the extended agreement also provides for slight rate decreases charged to at t wireless in both the second and third year of the agreement 
additionally  in april  we signed new roaming agreements with verizon wireless corporation verizon and cingular wireless cingular effective through march and april  respectively 
we expect roamer minutes to increase on a year over year basis accompanied by a decrease in contractual per minute rates resulting in roamer revenues remaining relatively flat in compared to in january  at t wireless and cingular announced a joint venture to build a mhz gsm system that overlays certain interstate highway portions of our footprint 
we believe that this joint venture will not have a material impact on our roamer revenues in equipment sales have increased over the past two years 
the increase for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due primarily to an increase in the average revenue per handset sold partially offset by a decrease in the number of handsets sold 
the increase in the average revenue 
table of contents per handset was due to an increase in the number of digital  dual mode and tri mode handsets sold 
for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase was due primarily to an increase in the volume of handsets sold partially offset by a decrease in the average revenue per handset sold 
as the cost of digital handsets continues to decline  we expect to pass these savings on to our customers  however  we expect to continue to sell these handsets at higher prices than we historically sold analog handsets 
domestic operating expenses the decrease in cost of service for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to decreased off network roaming costs for our customers as a result of lower contractual rates contained in our new roaming agreements with at t wireless  cingular and verizon 
this decrease was partially offset by increased costs associated with supporting growth in the number of subscriber and roamer mous 
the increase in cost of service for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was mainly attributable to the increased costs of maintaining our expanding domestic wireless network to support an increase in network usage by subscribers and roamers 
domestic cost of service per mou decreased to per mou for from per mou and per mou for and  respectively 
the decrease in domestic cost of service per mou during was due mainly to the decrease in off network roaming costs discussed above 
in addition  for all periods presented  we continue to see the fixed cost components of cost of service increasing at a slower rate than variable costs on a per minute basis 
we expect cost of service dollars to increase in future periods as a result of i a growing subscriber base  ii the increase in other carriers customers roaming on our network  and iii the increase in rate plans that include larger home calling areas 
domestic cost of service per mou is expected to continue to gradually decline as economies of scale continue to be realized 
cost of equipment sales decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the slight decrease was the result of a decrease in the volume of handsets sold offset by an increase in the average per unit cost of handsets sold due to a greater proportion of digital handsets in the overall handsets sold mix 
the increase in cost of equipment sales for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  resulted from three main factors i an increase in the number of handsets sold along with an increase in the average cost of handsets sold  ii free and discounted handsets associated with the migration of existing customers to our new cdma technology platform  and iii discounted or free handsets associated with the extension of existing service contracts 
in  we expect that regulatory and technological requirements  along with demand for feature rich handsets  will increase our per unit cost of handsets 
although subscribers generally are responsible for purchasing or otherwise obtaining their own handsets  we have historically sold handsets below cost to respond to competition and general industry practice and expect to continue to do so in the future 
the decrease in general and administrative costs for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily the result of our efforts during to reduce our operating costs 
the increase in general and administrative costs for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due mainly to a growth in the subscriber base at our previous cost structure 
our domestic general and administrative monthly cost per average subscriber decreased to in compared to in and in the decrease on a per average subscriber basis in compared to was primarily due to our efforts to reduce costs in  as previously discussed 
the decrease on a per average subscriber basis from compared to was primarily due to cost efficiencies related to a growing subscriber base 
we anticipate monthly cost per average subscriber to remain relatively constant in as compared to the decrease in sales and marketing costs for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  was primarily the result of a decrease in the fixed cost components of sales and marketing partially offset by an increase in variable cost components as we execute our strategy to shift to a more variable cost structure 
during  we decreased our number of owned store locations and the headcount associated with running those locations 
this has decreased our fixed costs for compared to and has shifted more of our sales and marketing emphasis to the agent and indirect channel which typically has a larger variable cost structure 
sales and marketing costs increased slightly from to in  sales and marketing cost per gross subscriber added  including the loss on equipment sales  increased to compared to in and in the increase in the average cost per gross subscriber addition in resulted mainly from fixed sales and marketing costs  including costs of retaining existing subscribers  being spread over fewer gross subscriber additions 
the increase from to was the result of an increase in equipment loss related to offering a greater mix of digital versus analog handsets to new customers 
further  we invested in migrating existing subscribers via free or reduced cost handsets to our new digital network in the costs of these handsets were included in the cost of equipment sales 
sales and marketing cost per gross subscriber added  including the loss on equipment sales  is expected to decrease in compared to as we continue to shift to a more variable cost structure 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for as compared to was mainly attributable to the growth of domestic wireless communication system assets partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense associated with the discontinuance of license amortization with the adoption on january  of sfas no 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for as compared to was mainly attributable to the growth of domestic wireless communication system assets 
as we continue to add wireless infrastructure to service our growing domestic subscriber base  we anticipate depreciation and amortization expense to increase in future periods 
the asset dispositions loss results from recording a million impairment charge related to the exploration of a sale of one of our rsas and from the implementation of our strategy to dispose of certain minor domestic non core assets 
early indications of market values for this rsa reflected that future cash flows upon sale would not exceed the carrying value of the license 
domestic ebitda domestic ebitda increased for compared to primarily as the result of decreases in operating and selling costs partially offset by decreases in subscriber and roamer revenues 
domestic ebitda increased for compared to due mainly to increased subscriber and roamer revenues and cost efficiencies related to the increased subscriber base partially offset by an increase in loss on equipment sales 
operating margin domestic ebitda as a percentage of service revenues increased to in compared to in and in we expect domestic ebitda to increase at a moderate pace in 
table of contents results of international operations for the years ended december   and the following discussions include  where meaningful  the results of wwi for the years ended december   and operating revenues and expenses and subscriber information exclude the operations of wwi s icelandic business  tal 
the sale of tal was completed in november since tal represented a component of our business with distinguishable cash flows and operations  it is presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
our statements of operations and balance sheet were reclassified accordingly 
our statement of operations was not reclassified because we did not acquire a controlling interest in tal until the third quarter of the consolidated accounts associated with tal in are not significant 
our international consolidated operations offer postpaid and prepaid mobile services in slovenia  austria  ireland  bolivia and haiti and fixed line service mainly in austria 
we had  consolidated international subscribers at december   a increase during we had  subscribers at december   an increase in excess of  in the increase was primarily due to  net additions and  subscribers acquired in the acquisition of tele 
ring telekom services gmbh tele 
ring at the end of june as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated international subscribers were prepaid customers 
as of december   we had  fixed lines 
year ended december  dollars in thousands revenues subscriber revenues roamer revenues fixed line revenues equipment sales other revenues total revenues operating expenses cost of service cost of equipment sales general and administrative sales and marketing depreciation and amortization stock based compensation total operating expenses ebitda international revenues the increase in subscriber revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to an increase in the number of subscribers across all of our markets and the inclusion of twelve months of subscriber revenues generated by tele 
ring  which was acquired at the end of june the increase in subscriber revenues in from was mainly due to the inclusion of six months of subscriber revenue generated by tele 
ring and the launch of operations in ireland and bolivia in february and november  respectively 
management anticipates continued growth in subscriber revenues as we add international subscribers and focus on growing arpu in the increase in roamer revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to expanded coverage in key tourist areas in austria and throughout ireland along with the inclusion of twelve months of roamer revenue generated by tele 
ring 
the increase in roamer revenues from to was mainly due to the inclusion of roamer revenue generated by tele 
ring since its acquisition and the launch of operations in ireland in february management expects roamer revenues to increase in as wwi expands its european coverage 
the increase in fixed line revenues in each consecutive year was primarily due to the inclusion of fixed line revenue generated by tele 
ring since its acquisition 
in  management expects that fixed line revenue will increase slightly 
equipment sales increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to an increase in gross international subscriber additions as a result of the launch of service in slovenia in december and the reduction of subsidies offered in the irish market 
the increase in equipment sales for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was due mainly to an increase in gross international subscriber additions as a result of the launch of our operations in ireland in february and in bolivia in november we anticipate modest continued growth in international equipment sales in primarily as a result of increases in mobile subscriber additions 

table of contents international operating expenses operating expenses represent the expenses incurred by our consolidated international markets and headquarters administration in the united states 
none of our international operating markets were consolidated and or operational for the entire year ended december  since  our international markets in ireland  bolivia and slovenia became operational and we acquired tele 
ring at the end of june accordingly  operating expenses increased substantially for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  and comparisons are not meaningful 
total cost of service increased for the year ended december  over the same period in this was due primarily to the acquisition of tele 
ring at the end of june and the launch of our international operations in slovenia in december on a per average international subscriber basis  monthly cost of service decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  management expects cost of service dollars to increase in future periods as a result of a growing subscriber base  but continue to decline on a per average international subscriber basis due to increased cost efficiencies 
the per international subscriber basis decrease in is not anticipated to be as significant as the rate decrease from to cost of equipment sales increased for the year ended december  over the same period in primarily due to our acquisition of tele 
ring at the end of june and the launch of operations in slovenia in december although subscribers generally are responsible for purchasing or otherwise obtaining their own handsets  wwi has historically sold handsets below cost to respond to competition and general industry practice and expects to continue to do so in the future 
general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december  over the same period in  primarily due to the acquisition of tele 
ring at the end of june and the launch of our international operations in slovenia in december  offset by cost reductions in our austrian operations 
general and administrative monthly cost per average international subscriber decreased to in as compared to in due to increased cost efficiencies as a result of the growing subscriber base 
management expects general and administrative dollars to increase on a year over year basis in as a result of a growing subscriber base  but decline on a per international subscriber basis due to increased cost efficiencies 
the cost per international subscriber decrease in is not anticipated to be as significant as the rate decrease from to sales and marketing expense excluding equipment subsidies remained relatively consistent on a year over year basis 
international cost per gross addition including equipment subsidies declined to in from in primarily due to reduced sales costs in austria and ireland partially offset by higher international consolidated equipment subsidies 
management expects sales and marketing costs to increase in compared to due to increased growth in subscriber additions and expects cost per gross add to increase due to slightly higher equipment subsidies 
depreciation and amortization expense increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due primarily to network expansion in our european markets 
slovenia was launched in december as wwi continues to add wireless infrastructure to service its growing international subscriber base  management anticipates depreciation and amortization expense will increase in future periods 
the decrease in stock based compensation each year is primarily a result of a revaluation of wwi s stock appreciation rights sars based on current market conditions 
international ebitda international ebitda for our international consolidated subsidiaries improved for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to the inclusion of tele 
ring s results of operations from acquisition in june and the launch of operations in bolivia  ireland and slovenia in the fourth quarter of  the first quarter of and the fourth quarter of  respectively 
international ebitda for our international consolidated subsidiaries declined for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to the inclusion of tele 
ring s results of operations and the launch of operations in bolivia and ireland in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  respectively 
we expect international ebitda to improve throughout as a result of continued subscriber growth and cost efficiencies in existing markets 
because wwi has operations in three countries in europe in which the functional currency is the euro or is linked to the euro  fluctuations in exchange rates may have a significant impact on its financial results of operations 
such fluctuations have less effect on local operating results  however  because wwi offers service within the countries in which they operate 
management cannot predict future fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and accordingly cannot predict the potential impact of any such fluctuations on wwi s results of operations 
consolidated other income expense interest and financing expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due to a reduction in our weighted average interest rate partially offset by an increase in our average long term debt 
interest and financing expense increased to million in from million in the increase was due to an increase in the average long term debt partially offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rate

subsequent to december   we entered into interest rate swaps on our bonds with a notional amount of million the bond swaps 
the bond swaps effectively convert million of our outstanding fixed rate debt at under the notes and the notes to variable rate debt 
the terms of the bond swaps set interest at libor plus to

provision for income taxes in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we have incurred a deferred income tax provision of approximately million for the year ended december  mainly to increase the valuation allowance related to our nol carryforwards 
this charge included million as the initial effect as of january  we have significant deferred tax liabilities related to our domestic licenses 
historically  we did not need a valuation allowance for the portion of our nol carryforward equal to the amount of license amortization expected to occur during the nol carryforward period 
since we ceased amortizing domestic licenses on january  for book purposes and we can no longer estimate the amount  if any  of deferred tax liabilities related to our domestic licenses  which will reverse during the nol carryforward period  we have increased the valuation allowance accordingly 
subsequent to january  we continue to amortize our domestic licenses for federal income tax purposes  but as previously discussed  domestic license costs are no longer amortized for book purposes 
the ongoing difference between book and tax amortization resulted in an additional deferred income tax provision of approximately million for the year ended december  the continuing deferred income tax provision results from growth in our deferred tax liability that cannot be estimated to reverse during our nol carryforward period 
this adjustment reflects tax accounting requirements and is not based on any changes to our business model  future prospects  the value of our licenses or our assessment of the likelihood of utilizing the tax nol carryforwards on a cash tax basis in the future 
deferred income taxes represent a non cash charge and are not currently paid or payable and accordingly there is no impact on interim cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities 
we will continue to evaluate the need for this valuation allowance for accounting purposes to determine if we should reverse all or part of the allowance in the future 
income tax expense for the year ended december   was comprised of domestic deferred income tax of million and foreign taxes currently payable of million 
consolidated net income loss from continuing operations before cumulative change in accounting principle the increase in the net loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of the domestic provision for income taxes  as discussed above  along with an increase in depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily in our international operations 
these items were offset by improvements in both international and domestic ebitda  as discussed above 
the change from net income from continuing operations in to net loss from continuing operations in was the result of several factors  including i the acquisition  launch of operations and consolidation of wwi markets during late and throughout  ii an increase in domestic equipment loss due to increases in the number of handsets sold  in particular  free and discounted handsets associated with the migration of existing customers to our new cdma technology platform  iii an increase in depreciation and amortization expense  and iv a million gain recorded on the sale of out latvian joint venture in total discontinued operations total discontinued operations for represented the gain on sale of million and net income of million from tal  our icelandic subsidiary

consolidated net operating loss carryforwards we had no domestic tax liability for the current period due to nol carryforwards from prior years 
at december   federal nol carryforwards amounting to approximately million were available 
we also have nols related to consolidated subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions of approximately million  which are reported at foreign statutory rates 
the federal nol carryforwards will expire between and we may be limited in our ability to use these carryforwards in any one year due to ownership changes that preceded the business combination that formed us in july and due to changes in shareholdings that occurred during we believe that  based on a number of factors  there is uncertainty regarding the realization of our nol carryforwards 
consolidated liquidity and capital resources we have a billion credit facility with a consortium of lenders the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for billion in revolving loans and billion in term loans 
as of december   billion was outstanding under the credit facility  which includes billion outstanding in revolving loans and billion outstanding in term loans 
based on the december  covenant analysis  we had million available to borrow under the revolving loan portion of the credit facility 
substantially all the domestic assets of the company are pledged as collateral for such indebtedness 
the terms of the credit facility contain certain quarterly covenants which impose limitations on our operations and activities  including  among other things  limitations on the 
table of contents incurrence of indebtedness  the sale of assets  investments and acquisitions  distribution of dividends or other distributions and loans 
failure to comply with covenants would result in an event of default and would allow the lenders to accelerate the maturity 
effective march   we must begin making principal payments on the credit facility 
the amount of required principal payments in is million based on outstanding borrowings at december  further  the amount available under the revolving loans decreases each quarter beginning with the quarter ending march  such reductions decrease borrowing capacity under the revolving loan portion of the credit facility by a cumulative amount of million by december  we have issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes at par and million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes at par 
indebtedness under the notes and notes matures on june   and february   respectively 
the notes and notes contain certain restrictive covenants which impose limitations on the operations and activities of us and certain of our subsidiaries  including the issuance of other indebtedness  the creation of liens  the sale of assets  issuance of preferred stock of subsidiaries and the making of restricted payments  investments and acquisitions

under the initial terms of the tele 
ring term loan  the amount available at inception was approximately million euro increasing quarterly to up to million euro on april  in january  the tele 
ring term loan was amended 
the amendment decreased the aggregate availability to million euro and extended the availability period through june under the amended terms of the tele 
ring term loan  repayment terms were extended  such that all outstanding principal and accrued interest shall be repaid based on predetermined percentages on each of july    and in december at december   tele 
ring had drawn approximately million 
subsequent to december   tele 
ring drew an additional million  leaving million euro undrawn and available under the tele

ring until it becomes free cash flow positive 
in april  vega entered into a credit facility agreement the slovenian credit facility with a consortium of banks to provide funding for the implementation and expansion of vega s network in slovenia 
the total amount available under the slovenian credit facility was million euro 
under the terms of the slovenian credit facility  all outstanding principal is required to be repaid in predetermined semi annual installments beginning on may  and ending on november  interest is accrued primarily at euribor plus an applicable margin  ranging from to  based on vega s financial and technical performance 
further  the slovenian credit facility requires vega to enter into interest rate hedge agreements on a predetermined schedule to manage the interest rate exposure 
the slovenian credit facility contains certain borrowing conditions and restrictive covenants  including minimum subscribers  population coverage  certain cash flow requirements  minimum contributed capital and debt service coverage 
western wireless international corporation wwic  a subsidiary of wwi  has guaranteed the slovenian credit facility under the following circumstances failure to meet specified network construction milestones  the subsidiary s insolvency  forfeiture of the licenses  or abandonment of the project 
additionally  wwic has agreed not to sell or dispose of any majority owned subsidiary without the approval of the slovenian lenders 
further  wwic has made a commitment that is collateralized by cash to contribute up to a maximum of million euro in additional capital to provide for revenue or operating cash flow shortfalls and cash balance deficiencies  if any 
in october  certain covenants under the slovenian credit facility were amended for which wwi made an additional equity contribution to vega of million 
as provided for under the slovenian credit facility  wwi contributed an additional million and committed million  paid in february  to vega as a result of vega s revenue shortfalls during the year ended december  based on current operating conditions  vega believes that it is necessary to amend certain terms and conditions of the slovenian credit facility in in order to avoid future revenue shortfalls or other covenant breaches  some of which cannot be remedied 
in march  wwi met with the lead arranger bank of the slovenian credit facility and believes that an agreement can be reached amending the slovenian credit facility and that no further borrowing will be permitted 
we believe no action will be taken to accelerate the loan during the pending negotiations to finalize the amendment 
we can offer no assurance that the participating banks will grant an amendment 
in the event that vega breaches one of the covenants that cannot be cured  measured each june and december  and does not obtain the amendment  the outstanding balance under the slovenian credit facility could become payable upon demand 
as of december   vega had drawn million under the slovenian credit facility and drew an additional million subsequent to year end 
in october  nuevatel  sa nuevatel  a subsidiary of wwi  entered into a bridge loan facility the bolivian bridge loan to provide funding for the build out and implementation of nuevatel s network in bolivia 
at december   the outstanding amount under the bolivian bridge loan was million and the facility was fully drawn 
the loan was originally scheduled to mature in its entirety in october in october  the maturity date of the bolivian bridge loan was extended to march  in january  the overseas private investment corporation opic approved a million loan guarantee for the refinancing of the bolivian bridge loan the bolivian refinancing 
the final terms of the bolivian refinancing are still being negotiated with prospective lenders 
we expect  but there can be no assurance that the bolivian bridge loan will be refinanced in the second quarter of until the bolivian refinancing is finalized  we intend to obtain additional extensions of the bolivian bridge loan maturity date  but there can be no assurance that any necessary extension will be granted 
the maturities of our aggregate long term debt  including that due within one year and classified as current are there total after dollars in millions domestic international total 
table of contents none of our international loan facilities have recourse to western wireless corporation 
as previously discussed  wwi and certain of its subsidiaries have severally guaranteed the bolivian bridge loan and the slovenian credit facility 
our domestic business plans include capital expenditures during in  if we attain our subscriber growth projections  we anticipate spending approximately million in capital expenditures for the continued improvements to our domestic network and back office infrastructure 
for  wwi s business plans include funding for capital expenditures and operating losses 
current business plans estimate that wwi entities will spend approximately million for capital expenditures 
wwi plans to fund these needs through local foreign borrowings  including the tele 
ring term loan  the bolivian refinancing  and contributions and advances from western wireless 
it is anticipated that the net contributions and advances from western wireless in will be approximately million to million 
we believe that domestic operating cash flow and available international loan facilities will be adequate to fund our projected domestic and international capital expenditures and credit facility principal repayments 
during  our domestic business plans do not indicate a need to borrow under the credit facility  even though borrowing capacity is expected to exist 
future borrowing capacity under the slovenian credit facility is expected to be cancelled 
however  if we do not achieve planned domestic operating cash flow targets  quarterly covenants and borrowing limitations contained in the credit facility and the notes and notes may be triggered that would limit the available borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
our operating cash flow is dependent upon  among other things i the amount of revenue we are able to generate from our customers  ii the amount of operating expenses required to provide our services  iii the cost of acquiring and retaining customers  and iv our ability to grow our customer base 
in order to comply with debt covenants or in the event that the borrowing capacity under the credit facility is limited or an amendment is not granted to us under the slovenian credit facility  or we are unable to complete the bolivian refinancing  we may be required to curtail capital spending  reduce expenses  or otherwise modify our planned operations and or seek additional debt or equity at the domestic or international level and or restructure or refinance our existing financing arrangements 
our ability to raise additional capital  if necessary  is subject to a variety of factors  including i the commercial success of our operations  ii the volatility and demand of the capital markets  conditions in the economy generally and the telecommunications industry specifically  and iii other factors we cannot presently predict with certainty 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to us or if such funding will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
on may   we distributed to our shareholders our entire interest in voicestream  now t mobile usa the spin off 
prior to the spin off  we had received a ruling from the internal revenue service to the effect that the spin off would not result in the recognition of income or gain by us or our shareholders 
notwithstanding the ruling  however  we would recognize a gain as a result of the spin off if the spin off were part of a prohibited plan  that is  a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquired  directly or indirectly  percent or more of our or voicestream s stock 
because acquisitions totaling percent or more of voicestream s stock occurred during the four year period beginning two years before the spin off  a rebuttable presumption exists that the spin off was part of a prohibited plan 
although the issue is not free from doubt  we believe that the spin off was not part of a prohibited plan and that the presumption can be rebutted 
in conjunction with the spin off  voicestream agreed to indemnify us on an after tax basis for any taxes imposed on us if an acquisition of voicestream s stock causes the spin off to be part of a prohibited plan 
as a result  if the presumption that the spin off was part of a prohibited plan is not successfully rebutted  we believe that voicestream would be responsible for our resulting tax liability arising from the spin off 
even if it is ultimately determined that the spin off was part of a prohibited plan  we believe that t mobile is capable of funding its resulting indemnity obligation to us 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  adjustments to the million net loss to reconcile to net cash provided by operating activities included i million of depreciation and amortization  ii million in deferred income taxes  iii million loss on asset dispositions  iv million related to the discontinued operations and sale of our icelandic subsidiary  v million minority interests in net losses of consolidated subsidiaries  and vi million equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates

in the ordinary course of business  we continue to evaluate business opportunities  joint ventures and other potential business transactions 
these opportunities  joint ventures and business transactions may be material  and require us to seek additional sources of funding through the issuance of additional debt and or additional equity at the parent or subsidiary level 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to us on acceptable or favorable terms  if at all 
seasonality we  and the wireless communications industry in general  have historically experienced significant subscriber growth during the fourth calendar quarter 
accordingly  during such quarter we experience greater losses on equipment sales and increases in sales and marketing expenses 
we have historically experienced highest usage and revenue per subscriber during the summer months 
we expect these trends to continue 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management we are exposed to various market financial risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates 
as part of our risk management program  we utilize interest rate caps  swaps and collars to hedge a portion of our variable rate interest risk 
interest rate risk our domestic operations have variable rate debt that at december  and had outstanding balances of billion and billion  respectively 
the fair value of such debt approximates the carrying value at december  of this variable rate debt  million was hedged using interest rate caps  swaps and collars which fixed interest rates between and during both years 
these caps  swaps and collars expire at various dates between march and august based on our domestic unhedged variable rate obligations outstanding at december  and a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the weighted average variable interest rate would have  respectively  increased or decreased our domestic annual interest expense by approximately and million  respectively  for such years 
our international operations also have variable rate debt that  at december  and  had an outstanding balance of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
the fair value of such debt approximates the carrying value at december  of this variable rate debt  million is hedged at december  using an interest rate swap  which fixes the interest rate at through november based on wwi s unhedged variable rate obligations outstanding at december  and a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the weighted average variable interest rate would have  respectively  increased or decreased our international annual interest expense by approximately and million  respectively  for such years 
the potential increases or decreases discussed above are based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level of variable rate debt for all maturities and an immediate  across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 
foreign currency risk currently  of our total international revenues are denominated in us dollars 
certain of our international subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar and their assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
a appreciation in the us dollar would have resulted in an approximately million and million decrease in loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and cumulative change in accounting principle during the years ended december  and  respectively 
a change in such loss would have resulted from applying a different exchange rate to translate and revalue the financial statements of our international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollars 
at december   our slovenian operations  whose functional currency is the slovenian tolar  had variable rate debt of approximately million denominated and repayable in euros and our austrian operations  whose functional currency is the euro  had variable rate debt  including accrued interest of approximately million denominated and repayable in euros 
a appreciation in the euro as compared to the slovenia tolar would have resulted in an approximately million increase in loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and cumulative change in accounting principle during the year ended december  a change in such loss would have been the result of an unrealized foreign exchange loss 
a appreciation in the euro and slovenian tolar as compared to the us dollar would have resulted in an approximately million increase in debt outstanding at december   and an approximately million increase in debt outstanding at december   with an offsetting currency translation adjustment
