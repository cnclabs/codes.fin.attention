significant accounting policies and assumptions financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
the company calculates its allowance for doubtful accounts based on an estimation process 
the company uses a mathematical calculation coupled with the specific identification of certain accounts to estimate its allowance for doubtful accounts 
estimates of the likelihood of collection are made based on a multi year historical average of the actual collections experience at each station 
the company charges accounts receivables off against its allowance for doubtful accounts when it deems them to be uncollectible on a specific identification basis 
program rights result from license agreements under which the company has acquired rights to broadcast certain television program material  and are stated at cost less amortization 
the cost of rights acquired is recorded as an asset and a liability when the program material has been accepted and made available for broadcast 
amortization is determined using both straight line and accelerated methods over the terms of the license agreements 
carrying amounts are regularly reviewed by management for indications of impairment and are adjusted when appropriate to estimated amounts recoverable from future broadcasts of the applicable program material 
advertising revenue for specific program contracts may not continue to equal or exceed the amortization being taken and additional adjustments may be necessary in the future 
fcc licenses and network affiliations and goodwill are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
 which the company adopted during the first quarter of  requires that intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be reviewed for impairment 
this review for impairment requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions to determine the estimated fair value of its individual stations and its station group as a whole 
these estimates and assumptions include  among other things  the future cash flows to be generated by its stations  terminal multiples for assumed station sales  discount rates to be used in present value calculations  and assumed future capital expenditure levels 
actual results and future market conditions could differ from those estimates and assumptions used 
station revenues are generated primarily from the sale of television advertising time  and are recognized in the period during which the advertising spots are aired 
station revenues also include revenues from network affiliation contracts 
revenues from network affiliation contracts are recorded as earned over the life of the contract 
cash payments received in excess of revenue earned to date are recorded as unearned revenue 
cable advertising revenues are generated primarily from assisting local cable operators with the sale of commercial time available in cable network programs 
revenues are recognized in the period during which the advertising spots sold by the company are aired by the local cable operator 
realized investment gains and losses are recognized using the specific identification method to determine the cost of investments sold 
gains and losses on the sale of real estate acquired for development and resale are included in net investment income 
realized gains and losses include write downs for impaired values of investment assets 
the company establishes impairments on specific assets at the time the company determines the assets to have been impaired 
in performing this determination management utilizes mathematical models  market information  and valuation information supplied by investee companies to determine if an impairment exists 
changes in market conditions or the valuations of the investee companies could significantly impact our judgments and require further adjustments to these balances 
the company reviews its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on estimated timing differences between the book and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities 
these estimates may be affected by future changes in enacted tax legislation and the results of regulatory review 
deferred tax assets are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  among other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
seasonality of television revenues the company s revenues are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations 
the advertising revenues of the stations are generally highest in the second and fourth quarter of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to and including the holiday season 
additionally  advertising revenues in even numbered years tend to be higher as they benefit from advertising placed by candidates for political offices and demand for advertising time in olympic broadcasts 
from time to time  proposals have been advanced in the us congress and at the fcc to require television broadcast stations to provide advertising time to political candidates at no or reduced charge  which would eliminate in whole or in part advertising revenues from political candidates
