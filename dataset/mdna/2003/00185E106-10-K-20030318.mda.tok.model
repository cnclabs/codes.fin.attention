the company s effective income tax rate benefit is for fiscal  compared to a effective income tax expense rate for fiscal the change in the effective rate is primarily the result of net favorable benefits related to the finalization and filing of tax returns which increased the tax benefit for critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of the company s financial statements revenue recognition  accounting for long lived assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  employee benefit accounting and income taxes 
any deviation from these policies or estimates could have a material impact on the financial statements of the company 
revenue recognition the company recognizes customer services revenue as services are performed for our clients in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition 
the client contracts generally require that clients be billed for the company s services on the basis of time spent by the company representatives providing services 
the company s services are also occasionally priced on a pay for performance basis  pursuant to which the company typically receives fees that are a combination of base rate plus fee per sale 
the company is often subject to performance standards  such as sales per hour  average handle time  occupancy rate and abandonment rate 
the company s performance against such standards may provide bonus opportunities or conversely may subject the company to penalties  which are recognized as earned or incurred 
accounting for long lived assets the company has approximately million of long lived assets as of december  these assets consist primarily of property and equipment  capitalized software and intangible assets 
in addition to the original cost of these assets  their recorded value is impacted by a number of policy elections made by the company  including estimated useful lives  salvage values and impairment charges 
in addition  any decision by the company to reduce capacity by closing customer interaction centers or to abandon software would result in a write off of the net book value of these affected assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair market value 
in making these determinations  the company utilizes certain assumptions  including  but not limited to estimated fair market value of the assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in the company s operations and estimated salvage values 
the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other tangible assets  for fiscal and  therefore  ceased amortizing goodwill in accordance with this standard 
as part of this adoption  assembled workforce of million was reclassified to goodwill 
goodwill amortization in fiscal and  as defined under this standard  was approximately million 
had this standard been implemented in fiscal  net income and earnings per share for the years ended december   december   and december   would have been net income loss as reported    plus amortization expenses   pro forma net income loss    earnings loss per diluted share as reported plus amortization expense pro forma earnings loss per diluted share the annual amortization expense related to intangible assets  which continue to be amortized  is million in fiscal  and each year thereafter for the next seven years 
as part of the implementation process for sfas no 
 the company performed a test of goodwill by establishing fair value of the company using discounted cash flows 
based on the results of the test  no impairment charge was required 
additionally  the company performed a similar test of goodwill at the end of fiscal and determined that no impairment existed as of that date 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a quarterly assessment of the probable estimated losses in trade accounts receivable 
this estimate is based on specific allowances for identified problem receivables and a general allowance for all other receivables based on their age and collection history 
accounting for employee benefits the company records an accrued liability for group health and workers compensation based on an estimate of claims incurred but not reported as well as asserted claims at the end of the year 
this estimate is derived from analysis performed by actuaries hired by the company who have expertise in this area 
however  although these estimates are generally reliable  changes in the employee mix and unforeseen events could result in an adjustment to these estimates 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
valuation allowances are recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standard number  accounting for asset retirement obligations in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires an entity to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the related long lived asset 
the liability is adjusted to its present value each period and the asset is depreciated over its useful life 
a gain or loss may be incurred upon settlement of the liability 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company has adopted this statement for fiscal but does not believe the impact of adopting this statement will have a material effect on its results of operations 
statement of financial accounting standard number  rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb no 
 and technical corrections in april  fasb issued sfas no 
 which eliminates the current requirement that all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
as a result  the criteria set forth by apb opinion will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
statement amended statement  and is no longer necessary because statement has been rescinded 
statement was issued to establish accounting requirements for the effects of transition to the provisions of the motor carrier act of statement also amends statement to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also makes non substantive technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  with earlier adoption encouraged 
the company does not expect the provisions of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows and intends to adopt sfas no 
for the fiscal year 
statement of financial accounting standards number  accounting for cost associated with exit or disposal activities in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which changes the timing of recognition for certain exit costs associated with restructuring activities  so that certain exit costs would be recognized over the period in which the restructuring activities occur 
currently exit costs are recognized when the company commits to a restructuring plan 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and could result in the company recognizing the cost of future restructuring activities over a period of time as opposed to as a single event 
financial accounting standards board interpretations no 
and in november of  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires entities to establish liabilities for certain types of guarantees  and expands financial statement disclosures for others 
the accounting requirements of fin no 
are effective for guarantees issued or modified after december   and the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company does not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have any significant accounting implications  as the majority of its commitments are on behalf of the company and its subsidiaries 
the company has adopted the disclosure requirements of fin no 
effective december  on january   the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb 
the primary objectives of fin no

the transitional disclosure requirements of fin no 
take effect immediately and are required in all financial statements initially issued after january   if certain conditions are met 
the company does not have any variable interest entities and therefore  fin no 
will not impact its financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth consolidated statements of cash flow data for the company for years ended december   december   and december   respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided used by investing activities net cash used by financing activities net increase decrease in cash in fiscal  cash from operating activities increased million versus fiscal primarily as a result of a million decrease in accounts receivable from year end and improved cash generated from operations 
receivables declined in fiscal due to a reduction in sales 
days sales outstanding at year end remained unchanged at in fiscal from fiscal cash generated from operations benefited from higher margins and reduced cash restructuring charges 
net cash used by investing activities increased million from the same period of fiscal as capital expenditures of million in fiscal were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of paragren 
capital expenditures of million in fiscal were primarily due to the purchase of it hardware and software and equipment 
capital expenditures in the same period of fiscal related to it hardware  software and expansion into a new center 
on december   the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement current credit agreement replacing the previous amended and restated credit facility previous credit facility 
under the terms of the current credit agreement  the company has a revolving credit facility  which expires december the facility initially provides million of credit availability 
beginning on march   the facility will be reduced by million of availability each quarter until the facility reaches million at december  availability is also reduced by outstanding borrowings and any outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   there were million of outstanding borrowings under the facility and approximately million were utilized through the issuance of standby letters of credit primarily to support self insurance reserves 
net availability as of december   under the current credit agreement was million 
additionally  the company maintained million of cash and cash equivalents as of december   which was available for general corporate requirements 
the current credit agreement is secured principally by a grant of a security interest in all personal property and fixtures of the company 
under the terms of the current credit agreement  the company is also required to maintain certain financial covenants which limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  repurchase outstanding common shares  create liens  acquire  sell or dispose of certain assets  engage in certain mergers and acquisitions  and to make certain restricted payments 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants and restrictions imposed by the terms of the current credit agreement 
borrowings under the current credit agreement incur a floating interest rate usually based on the libor index rate  although the company has the option of using an alternate base rate defined in the agreement 
in addition  the company pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving facility as well as quarterly fees on the outstanding letters of credit 
for fiscal years  and  million  million and million  respectively of debt issuance costs related to the previous credit facility were amortized 
the remaining million of costs were written off upon termination of the previous credit facility in december of the company made million of principal payments to pay down and then pay off the term loan included in its previous credit facility during fiscal additionally  the company paid million in the fourth quarter to unwind the interest rate swap agreement that hedged a portion of the interest rate risk on the previous credit facility

payment due by period in thousands to total contractual obligations borrowings under current credit agreement  capital lease obligations  operating leases      other debt other commercial commitments training bonds telecommunications commitments    letters of credit     the company expects that its cash balances  cash flows from future operations and available borrowings under the current credit agreement will be sufficient to meet normal operating needs  fund any planned capital expenditures and repay debt obligations payable during fiscal year however  a significant change in operating cash flow could impact the company s ability to meet its cash requirement needs and comply with the covenants of its credit facility 
quarterly results the company s operating results in any single period should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results as the services offered by the company are subject to variations in profitability 
the company could experience variations in net revenue and income as a result of many factors  including the timing of clients marketing campaigns and customer service programs  the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to acquire and support such new business and changes in the company s revenue mix among its various clients and service offerings 
in connection with certain contracts  the company could incur costs in periods prior to recognizing revenue under those contracts 
in addition  the company must plan its operating expenditures based on revenue forecasts  and a revenue shortfall below such forecast in any quarter would likely adversely affect the company s operating results for that quarter 
while the effects of seasonality on the company s business have historically been obscured by its changes in net revenue  the company s business tends to be slower in the first and third quarters of its fiscal year due to client marketing programs which are typically slower in the post holiday and summer months

except as required under the federal securities laws and rules and regulations of the sec  the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements in connection with new information or future events or otherwise 
factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated include  but are not limited to  reliance by the company on a small number of principal clients for a substantial proportion of its total revenue  possible changes in or events affecting the business of the company s clients  including changes in customers interest in  and use of  clients products and services  fluctuations in quarterly results of operations due to timing of clients initiation and termination of large programs  changes in competitive conditions affecting the company s industry  the ability of the company s clients to terminate contracts with the company on a relatively short notice  changes in the availability and cost of qualified employees  variations in the performance of the company s automated system and other technological factors  changes in government regulations affecting the teleservices and telecommunications industries  and competition from other outside providers of customer interaction solutions and in house customer interaction operations 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations  the forward looking statements of the company contained in this report on form k are also subject to the following risks and uncertainties client concentration  contract terms  client industries as noted in item  business clients  of the company s revenues are accounted for by ten clients 
three clients constituted more than each of the company s net revenues 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain any of its larger clients or that the volumes of its most profitable or larger programs will not be reduced  or that the company would be able to replace such clients or programs with clients or programs that generate a comparable amount of revenue or profits 
consequently  the loss of one or more of its significant clients could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
as noted in item  business clients  the company provides services to its clients pursuant to contracts  many of which may be terminated without cause and most of which do not have minimum volume requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company s clients will not terminate their contracts before their scheduled expiration date or that the volumes of their programs will not be reduced 
in any of these events  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to replace a client or program with any other client or program that would generate a comparable amount of revenue or profits 
consequently  the loss of one or more of its significant clients  or the substantial reduction of the amount of services performed by the company for a significant client  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
many of the company s clients are concentrated in the telecommunications  financial services  insurance  health care and pharmaceuticals and logistics industries 
a significant downturn in any of these industries or a trend in any of these industries not to use  or to reduce their use of  telephone based sales  marketing or customer management solutions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
government regulation the fcc  ftc and various states have promulgated and enacted rules and laws that govern the methods and processes of making and completing telephone solicitations and sales 
the company believes that its operating procedures currently comply in all material respects with presently effective provisions of the telephone solicitation and sales rules of the fcc  ftc and applicable states 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company would not be subject to agency or state proceedings alleging violation of such rules 
the company is developing protocols designed to meet the requirements of the amended tsr  and the company believes that it will be in compliance in all material respects with the new provisions of that rule as they take effect 
the company  however  cannot offer assurances at this time that the requirements or deadlines of the amended tsr will be met 
future laws and regulations may require the company to modify its operations or service offerings in order to effectively meet its clients service requirements  and there can be no assurance that additional regulations would not limit the activities of the company or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance 
for further discussion of regulatory issues  see item government regulations 
even if the company complies with the applicable state and federal telemarketing regulations  the restrictions imposed by such regulations may generally adversely impact the telemarketing industry 
the ftc s registry  states lists  the tcpa do not call lists  and the prospect of an fcc sponsored national do not call system are likely to have a cumulative effect of reducing the effectiveness of the telephone sales channel 
this may cause clients to reduce the volume of business outsourced to the company 
regulations regarding the use of technology  such as restrictions on automated dialers or the required transmittal of caller identification information  may further reduce the efficiency or effectiveness of the company s operations 
overall  the increased regulatory pressure on telemarketing operations may force some smaller  independent service providers out of the industry  and companies that outsource marketing campaigns to providers may concentrate their activities with larger  established providers that are capable of meeting regulatory demands 
the company  however  cannot predict the impact state and federal regulations may have on its business or whether such impact may adversely affect or limit its operations 
several of the industries in which the company s clients operate are subject to varying degrees of government regulation  particularly in the telecommunications  insurance and financial services industries 
the company could be subject to a variety of enforcement or private actions for its failure or the failure of its clients to comply with such regulations 
there is increasing federal and state interest in privacy protection  some aspects of which could impose additional regulatory pressure on the business of the company s clients and  less directly  on the company s business 
the results of the company s operations could be impacted by such pressure if it has the effect of reducing the demand for our services or exposes us to potential liability 
sales of certain client products and services may also be subject to federal and state regulation  thus requiring the company to comply with the regulations 
for example  the company s telephone representatives who sell insurance products are required to be licensed by various state insurance commissions 
the company also employs licensed pharmacists and maintains licenses required for the gaming industry 
changes in the licensing regulations or their implementation could materially increase the company s operating costs 
competitors  international capacity  potential future competing technologies and trends as noted in item  business competition  the industry in which the company competes is extremely competitive and highly fragmented 
a number of the company s competitors have capabilities and resources equal to  or greater than  the company s  and there can be no assurance that additional competitors with greater resources than the company will not enter the industry or particular segments of the industry 
these include small firms  large publicly traded firms operating in the business process outsourcing field  and clients or potential clients which expand their existing capabilities and market services to other companies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully 
a number of the company s competitors have opened  or have announced the opening of customer interaction centers in canada  the caribbean  india  the philippines or other offshore locations in order to provide services to north american clients at reduced cost 
it is uncertain whether these offshore capabilities will be as effective on a large scale basis as the same competitors united states facilities or what the demand for those offshore services may be 
nonetheless  the potential movement of business offshore at reduced prices may result in pressure on the company s gross profit margin or a loss of business to such competitors 
the development of new forms of direct sales and marketing techniques  such as interactive home shopping through television  computer networks and other media  could have an adverse effect on the demand for the company s customer acquisition services 
in addition  the increased use of new telephone based technologies  such as interactive voice response systems and increased use of the internet  could reduce the demand for certain of the company s customer care offerings 
moreover  the effectiveness of marketing by telephone could also decrease as technologies and service devices to screen calls from marketers are developed and become available to consumers 
although the company attempts to monitor industry trends and respond accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to anticipate and successfully respond to all such trends in a timely manner 
reliance on technology the company has invested in sophisticated and specialized telecommunications and computer technology  and has focused on the application of this technology to provide customized solutions to meet its client s needs 
the company anticipates that it will be necessary to continue to select  invest in and develop new and enhanced technology on a timely basis in the future in order to maintain its competitiveness 
the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to continue to develop information technology solutions which keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing client demands 
in addition  the company s business is highly dependent on its computer and telephone equipment and software systems  and the temporary or permanent loss of such equipment or systems  through casualty or operating malfunction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
dependence on key personnel the success of the company depends in large part upon the abilities and continued service of its executive officers and other key employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain the services of such officers and employees 
the loss of key personnel could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
the company has entered into employment agreements with some of its executive officers and other key employees  however  these agreements do not ensure their continued employment 
the company also has non competition agreements with each of its existing key personnel 
however  courts are at times reluctant to enforce such agreements 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel as needed  which could adversely affect the company s business 
dependence on labor force the company s industry is very labor intensive and has experienced high personnel turnover 
many of the company s employees receive modest hourly wages and  although the company employs a significant number of full time employees  many are nevertheless employed on a part time basis 
a higher turnover rate among the company s employees would increase the company s recruiting and training costs and decrease operating efficiencies and productivity 
some of the company s operations  particularly insurance product sales and technology based inbound customer service  require specially trained employees 
growth in the company s business will require it to recruit and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate from time to time 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to hire  train and retain a sufficient labor force of qualified employees 
a significant portion of the company s costs consists of wages to hourly workers 
an increase in hourly wages  costs of employee benefits or employment taxes could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
dependence on telephone service the company s business is materially dependent on telephone and data service provided by various local and long distance telephone companies telcos 
because of this dependence  any change to the telecommunications market that would disrupt these services or limit the ability of the company to obtain services or favorable rates could adversely impact the company s operations 
the company has taken steps to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with rate fluctuations and service disruption by entering into long term contracts with multiple telcos 
there is no obligation  however  for any of company s telco vendors to renew their contracts with company or to offer the same or lower rates in the future  and such contracts are subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of the company s control  including bankruptcy or insolvency of the telecommunications service provider or rate increases imposed by governmental authorities 
a significant increase in the cost of telephone services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of the company s services  or any significant interruption in telephone services  could have a materially adverse impact on the company 
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company could experience quarterly variations in revenue and operating income as a result of many factors  including the timing of clients marketing campaigns and customer service programs  the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to acquire and support such new business and changes in the company s revenue mix among its various service offerings 
in connection with certain contracts  the company could incur costs in periods prior to recognizing revenue under those contracts 
in addition  the company must plan its operating expenditures based on revenue forecasts  and a revenue shortfall below such forecast in any quarter would likely adversely affect the company s operating results for that quarter 
the effects of seasonality on the company s business have historically been obscured by its changes in net revenue 
however  the company s business tends to be slower in the first and third quarters due to client marketing programs  which are typically slower in the post holiday and summer months 
risks inherent in conducting business internationally the company is starting up its initial offshore customer interaction center in the philippines 
there are certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  including exposure to currency fluctuations  the necessity to comply with foreign laws  unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s international operations and  consequently  on the business results of operations and financial condition of the company 
war and terrorist attacks could disrupt operations the risks of war and potential terrorist attacks on the company s operations cannot be estimated 
war and terrorist attacks could disrupt its operations 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common shares has fluctuated over a wide range during the past several years and may continue to do so in the future 
for further discussion  see item  market for registrant s common equity and related share owner matters 
the market price of the common shares could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors or events  including among other things  the depth and liquidity of the trading market of the common shares  quarterly variations in actual liquidity of the trading market of the common shares  quarterly variations in actual and anticipated operating results  growth rates  changes in estimates by analysts  loss of analyst coverage  market conditions in the industry in which the company competes  announcements by competitors  the loss of a significant client or a significant change in the company s relationship with a significant client  regulatory actions  litigation  including class action litigation  and general economic conditions 
control by principal share owner mr 
schwartz  the company s chairman  beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding common shares 
in addition  two trusts  established by mr 
schwartz  each beneficially owns approximately of the outstanding common shares 
as a result  mr 
schwartz is able to exercise significant control over the outcome of substantially all matters requiring action by the company s share owners 
such voting concentration may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of us interest rate changes directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
from time to time  the company enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
in december  the company terminated the derivative agreement related to its previous credit facility  which was replaced on december   by the current credit agreement 
a new derivative agreement has not been established due to the trend in interest rates and the low levels of current borrowings 
the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income of million related to the interest rate swap was recognized through higher interest expense during fiscal  including million related to terminating the swap agreement 
the company prepared a sensitivity analysis of its debt assuming a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates 
holding all other variables constant  the hypothetical adverse change would not significantly increase interest expense 
the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
