table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview 
we offer managed care and other health insurance products to employer groups and medicare beneficiaries in eight western states and guam 
our commercial and senior plans are designed to deliver quality health care and customer service to members cost effectively 
these programs include health maintenance organizations  or hmos  preferred provider organizations  or ppos  and medicare supplement products 
we also offer a variety of specialty managed care products and services that employees can purchase as a supplement to our basic commercial and senior medical plans or as stand alone products 
these products include pharmacy benefit management  or pbm  behavioral health services  group life and health insurance and dental and vision benefit plans 
revenue commercial and medicare premiums 
we receive per member per month payments on behalf of each member enrolled in our commercial hmos and our behavioral health services  life and health insurance and dental and vision services plans 
generally  our medicare choice contracts entitle us to per member per month payments from the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  on behalf of each enrolled medicare beneficiary 
we report prepaid health care premiums received from our commercial plans enrolled groups  cms  and our medicare plans members as revenue in the month that members are entitled to receive health care 
we record premiums received in advance as unearned premium revenue 
premiums for our commercial products and medicare choice products are generally fixed in advance of the periods covered 
of our commercial business  more than of our membership renews on january of each year  with premiums that are generally fixed for periods up to one year 
in addition  each of our subsidiaries that offers medicare choice products must submit adjusted community rate proposals  generally by county or service area  to cms by september for each such product that will be offered in a subsequent year 
as a result  increases in the costs of health care service in excess of the estimated future health care costs reflected in the premiums or the adjusted community rate proposals generally cannot be recovered in the applicable contract year through higher premiums or benefit designs 
generally  since the balanced budget act of went into effect  annual premium increases for medicare choice members have not kept pace with increases in the costs of health care 
cms announced that federal payments to medicare choice managed care organizations are projected to increase only  the guaranteed minimum required by law  in calendar year these shortfalls in medicare choice premiums compared to our health care service expenses in some of our operating areas contributed to our decision to cease offering  close enrollment  or obtain capacity limits in our medicare choice plans in various counties in  and these premium trends also contributed to changes in our benefits  copayments and deductibles 
the following table provides information on the number of counties where we did offer or currently offer our medicare choice plans for new member enrollment as of the dates indicated 
additionally  it provides information on the number of counties for which we contracted with cms to offer our medicare choice plans  as of the beginning of each calendar year indicated 
the change in the number of counties from to for which we contracted with cms to offer our 
table of contents medicare choice health plans was due to service area exits in california as well as our exit from the houston  texas market 
january  january  january  counties in which secure horizons contracted with cms to offer medicare choice plans counties in which secure horizons has voluntarily closed enrollment or set capacity limits counties in which secure horizons offers medicare choice plans for new member enrollment other income 
other income consists of revenue we receive from administrative services we offer through our specialty products companies  primarily from our pharmacy benefit management company 
our pharmacy benefit management company generates mail service revenue where we  rather than network retail pharmacies  collect the member copayments  for both affiliated and unaffiliated members 
additionally  we record revenues for prescription ingredient costs on prescriptions dispensed by our mail service pharmacy 
for prescription drugs dispensed through retail pharmacies  we record administrative services fees when a prescription claim is reviewed and approved  and the prescription is shipped or filled 
for prescription drugs dispensed through retail pharmacies  we do not record revenues for drugs dispensed or the network pharmacies dispensing fees  nor do we record revenues for copayments our members make to the retail pharmacies 
net investment income 
net investment income consists of interest income  gross realized gains and losses experienced based on the level of cash invested over each period 
as we have increased the number of our contracts that are risk based rather than capitated contracts  our net investment income has become  and will continue to be an important component to results of operations 
under risk based contracts  cash disbursements to health care providers for services provided to members are made after the related claim has been submitted and adjudicated 
under capitated contracts  health care providers are prepaid on a fixed fee per member per month basis for the agreed upon schedule of services  without regard to the volume of services provided to a given member 
expenses commercial and senior health care services 
health care services expenses for our commercial plans and our senior plans primarily comprise payments to physicians  hospitals and other health care providers under capitated or risk based contracts for services provided to our members 
health care services expenses also include expenses for health care provided and administrative services performed under our specialty products and services companies 
our risk based health care services expenses consist mostly of four cost of care components outpatient care  inpatient care  professional services primarily physician care and pharmacy benefit costs 
all four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates 
unit costs  for example  are the cost of outpatient medical procedures  inpatient hospital stays  physician fees for office visits and prescription drug prices 
utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and vary with the age and health of our members and broader social and lifestyle patterns of the population as a whole 
the cost of health care provided is accrued in the month services are provided to members  based in part on estimates for hospital services and other health care costs that have been incurred but not yet reported 
we develop these estimates using actuarial methods based on historical data for payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  utilization of health care services and other relevant factors 
these estimates are adjusted in future periods as we receive actual claims data  and can either increase or reduce our accrued health care costs 
the cost of prescription drugs covered under our commercial and senior plans is expensed when the prescription drugs are dispensed 
our commercial and senior plans also provide incentives  through a variety of programs  for health care providers that participate in those plans to control 
table of contents health care costs while providing quality health care 
expenses related to these programs  which are based in part on estimates  are recorded in the period in which the related services are provided 
historically  we have primarily arranged health care services for our members by contracting with health care providers on a capitated basis  regardless of the services provided to each member 
under our risk based contracts  we generally bear or partially share the risk of excess health care expenses with health care providers  meaning that if member utilization of health care services exceeds agreed on amounts  we bear or partially share the excess expenses with the applicable health care provider 
the following table illustrates our shift from capitated contracts to risk based contracts since we expect this shift to continue in the percentages of hmo membership by contract type at december   and were as follows hospital physician december  commercial capitated risk based fee for service senior capitated risk based fee for service total capitated risk based fee for service compared with membership

the fhp notes share in the collateral securing our obligations under our senior credit facility 

table of contents our ability to repay debt depends in part on dividends and cash transfers from our subsidiaries 
nearly all of the subsidiaries are subject to hmo regulations or insurance regulations and may be subject to substantial supervision by one or more hmo or insurance regulators 
subsidiaries subject to regulation must meet or exceed various capital standards imposed by hmo or insurance regulations  which may from time to time impact the amount of funds the subsidiaries can pay to us 
our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us 
additionally  from time to time  we advance funds in the form of a loan or capital contribution to our subsidiaries to assist them in satisfying state financial requirements 
we may provide additional funding to a subsidiary if a state regulator imposes additional financial requirements due to concerns about the financial position of the subsidiary or if there is an adverse effect resulting from changes to the risk based capital requirements 
this may in turn affect the subsidiary s ability to pay dividends or make other cash transfers 
we may continue to seek to refinance our senior bank credit facility  which will mature in january  using equity or debt financing alternatives 
our debt is rated below investment grade by the major credit rating agencies as follows senior convertible credit senior subordinated agency outlook facility notes debentures moody s positive b b b standard poor s stable bb b b fitch ibca stable bb bb bb consequently  if we seek to raise funds in capital markets transactions  our ability to do so will be limited to issuing additional non investment grade debt or issuing equity and or equity linked instruments 
we may not be able to issue any such securities at all or on terms favorable to us 
any issuance of equity or equity linked securities may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
in december  we entered into an equity commitment arrangement with acqua wellington north american equities fund ltd  or acqua wellington  an institutional investor  for the purchase by acqua wellington of up to million shares or million in our common stock 
in april  we made a draw down under our equity commitment arrangement with acqua wellington 
as a result of this draw down  we sold  shares to acqua wellington for an average price of per share 
the total proceeds from the draw down were approximately million 
this equity commitment arrangement will expire in june we expect to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditures during the next twelve months from our cash flow from operations 
we have taken a number of steps to increase our internally generated cash flow  including increasing premiums  increasing our marketing of specialty product lines  introducing new products to generate new revenue sources and reducing our expenses by  among other things  exiting from unprofitable markets and cost savings initiatives 
if our cash flow is less than we expect due to one or more of the risk factors described in forward looking statements  or our cash flow requirements increase for reasons we do not currently foresee  then we may need to draw down remaining available funds on our revolving credit facility which matures in january  or our equity commitment arrangement which expires in june a failure to comply with any covenant in the senior credit facility could make funds under our revolving credit facility unavailable 
we also may be required to take additional actions to reduce our cash flow requirements  including the deferral of planned investments aimed at reducing our selling  general and administrative expenses 
the deferral or cancellation of any investments could have a material adverse impact on our ability to meet our short term business 
table of contents objectives 
our contractual cash obligations  including long term debt and other commitments  as of december  were as follows payments due by period total thereafter amounts in millions long term debt senior notes  net of discount senior credit facility convertible subordinated debentures fhp senior notes database financing agreement other total long term debt commitments other commitments information technology outsourcing contracts operating leases total other commitments total contractual cash obligations as of december   we had million available in a restricted cash collateral account that will be used to repurchase or repay the fhp senior notes 
other balance sheet change explanations receivables  net 
receivables  net as of december   decreased million from december  as follows million decrease in provider receivables  primarily from collections of amounts owed by various providers in california and texas  million decrease in premiums receivable primarily related to a reduction in membership and an increase in collection efforts  partially offset by premium rate increases  million decrease in trade receivables  primarily due to the impact of lower rebates earned due to changes in senior prescription drug benefits  partially offset by increased billings for new unaffiliated pharmacy benefit management customers  and million decrease in other receivables 
goodwill and intangible assets  net 
goodwill and intangible assets as of december  decreased from december  due primarily to a million goodwill impairment charge before the deferred tax impact and million of intangible amortization expense 
as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we recorded impairment charges as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january  medical claims and benefits payable 
the majority of our medical claims and benefits payable represent liabilities related to our risk based contracts 
under risk based contracts  claims are payable once incurred and cash disbursements are made to health care providers for services provided to members after the related claim has been submitted and adjudicated 
under capitated contracts  health care providers are prepaid on a fixed fee per member per month basis  regardless of the services provided to members 
the liabilities that arise for capitated contracts relate to timing issues primarily due to membership changes 
table of contents that may occur 
as of december   approximately of medical claims and benefits payable was attributable to risk based contracts 
medical claims and benefits payable as of december  decreased million from december   primarily because senior shared risk membership has decreased since december  this senior membership decrease more than offset increased senior health care costs trends 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased million from december   primarily due to the decrease in the opm reserve  offset in part by increased selling  general and administrative expenses  as described in results of operations selling  general and administrative expenses 
stockholders equity 
the decreases in treasury stock and additional paid in capital from december  were primarily due to the reissuance of approximately  shares of treasury stock  of which approximately  shares were reissued under the equity commitment arrangement  approximately  shares were reissued in connection with the retirement of fhp senior notes and approximately  shares were reissued in connection with our employee benefit plans during the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures 
the accounting estimates that we believe involve the most complex judgments  and are the most critical to the accurate reporting of our financial condition and results of operations include the following incurred but not reported or paid claims reserves 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for incurred but not reported  or ibnr  claims submitted under our risk based provider contracts  primarily using standard actuarial methodologies based on historical data 
these standard actuarial methodologies include  among other factors  the average interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are received and or paid  denied claims activity  disputed claims activity  expected health care cost inflation  utilization  seasonality patterns and changes in membership 
the estimates for submitted claims and ibnr claims liabilities are made on an accrual basis and adjusted  based on actual claims data  in future periods as required 
for new products  such as our ppo products  estimates are initially based on health care cost data provided by third parties 
this data includes assumptions for member age  gender and geography 
the models that we use to prepare estimates for each product are adjusted as we accumulate actual claims data 
such estimates could materially understate or overstate our actual liability for medical claims and benefits payable 
these estimates are reviewed by outside parties and state regulatory authorities on a periodic basis 
the estimates for submitted claims and ibnr claims liabilities are made on an accrual basis and adjusted in future periods as required 
adjustments to prior period estimates  if any  are included in the current period 
provider insolvency reserves 
we maintain insolvency reserves for our capitated contracts with providers that include estimates for potentially insolvent providers  where conditions indicate claims are not being paid or have slowed considerably 
these insolvency reserves include write offs of certain uncollectable receivables from providers and the estimated cost of unpaid health care claims that were previously the responsibility of the capitated provider 
depending on states laws  we may be held liable for unpaid health care claims that were previously the responsibility of the capitated provider and for which we have already paid capitation 
these estimates could materially understate or overstate our actual liability for medical claims and benefits payable 
ordinary course legal proceedings 
from time to time  we are involved in legal proceedings that involve claims for coverage and tort liability encountered in the ordinary course of business 
the loss of even one of these claims  if it results in a significant punitive damage award  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our exposure to potential liability under punitive damage theories may significantly decrease our ability to settle these claims on reasonable terms

risks relating to us and our industry we cannot predict whether we will be able to replace some or all of the revenue we may lose in the future from our medicare choice products  with new sources of revenue 
without a replacement for any lost revenue from our medicare choice products  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we have reduced our participation in the medicare choice program  which has accounted for more than of our total revenue in each year since  because of shortfalls in medicare choice premiums compared to our rising health care services expenses and increased medicare administration costs 
these shortfalls contributed to our decision to cease offering or close enrollment in our medicare choice products in various counties in through  including our plan to withdraw our medicare choice products in five counties in california and texas in affecting  members or approximately of our senior hmo membership 
these shortfalls also contributed to changes in our benefits  copayments and deductibles 
we also expect to experience voluntary attrition  which may be significant  in our medicare choice membership as we continue to scale back benefits and increase monthly premiums under our medicare choice products to achieve more profitable levels 
our market exits  together with the voluntary attrition that we attribute to reduced benefits and increased premiums resulted in a reduction of approximately  members in the year ended december  we currently expect medicare choice membership to decline during  due primarily to benefit design changes and our exit from five counties affecting  members 
to the extent that we continue to reduce our participation in the medicare choice program  our revenue will decline unless lost revenue from our medicare choice products is replaced with revenue from other sources  such as our medicare supplement product offerings or other lines of business 
we cannot predict whether or when we will be able to replace some or all of our lost revenue from our medicare choice products with new sources of revenue 
without a replacement for any lost revenue from our medicare choice products  our results of operations could be adversely affected  for example by increasing our administrative costs as a percentage of our revenue 

table of contents our premiums for our commercial products and medicare choice products are generally fixed in advance of the periods covered and our profitability may suffer to the extent that those premiums do not adequately allow for increases in the costs of health care services over those periods 
of our commercial business  more than of our membership renews on january of each year  with premiums that are generally fixed for periods up to one year 
in addition  each of our subsidiaries that offers medicare choice products must submit adjusted community rate proposals  generally by county or service area  to the cms by september for each medicare choice product that will be offered in a subsequent year 
as a result  increases in the costs of health care services in excess of the estimated future health care costs reflected in the premiums or the adjusted community rate proposals generally cannot be recovered in the applicable contract year through higher premiums or benefit designs 
many factors  including health care costs that rise faster than premium increases  increases in utilization and regulatory changes  could cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums 
to the extent that such excesses occur  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
our future profitability will depend in part on accurately pricing our products  predicting health care costs  the provider reimbursement methodology and on our ability to control future health care costs 
we use our underwriting systems to establish and assess premium rates based on accumulated actuarial data  with adjustments for factors such as claims experience and hospital and physician contract changes 
we may be less able to accurately price our new products than our other products because of our relative lack of experience and accumulated data for our new products 
our future profitability will depend in part on our ability to predict health care costs and control future health care costs through underwriting criteria  medical and disease management programs  product design and negotiation of favorable provider and hospital contracts  and we may be less able to do so for our new products than for our other products 
these factors are of greater significance  to the extent that we have entered into and may continue to increasingly enter into fee for service contracts with hospitals and physicians due to the continuing industry trend away from capitation contracts 
in addition  changes in demographic characteristics  the regulatory environment  health care practices  inflation  new technologies  continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  contractual disputes with providers and numerous other factors may adversely affect our ability to predict and control health care costs as well as our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our financial and operating performance could be adversely affected by a reduction in revenue caused by membership losses  a failure to achieve expected membership levels in new products or products targeted for growth  or lower than expected premiums 
our revenues have declined during compared to due to commercial and senior membership losses  primarily as a result of our exits of unprofitable markets and products  termination of contracts with network providers and increased premiums and benefit reductions 
a loss of profitable membership  an inability to increase commercial membership in targeted markets  including unaffiliated membership in our pbm and other specialty businesses  including our ppo and medicare supplement products  an inability to gain market acceptance and expected membership in new product lines  including our ppo and medicare supplement products  or an inability to achieve expected premium increases could result in lower revenues than expected and negatively affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that could contribute to the loss of membership  failure to gain new members in targeted markets or new product lines  or lower premium revenue include the effect of premium increases  benefit changes and member paid supplemental premiums and copayments on the retention of existing members and the enrollment of new members  the inability of our marketing and sales plans to attract new customers or retain existing customers for existing products and new products  the member s assessment of our benefits  quality of service  our ease of use and our network stability for members in comparison to competing health plans  
table of contents our exit from selected service areas  including medicare choice markets or commercial markets  our limits on enrollment of new medicare choice and commercial members in selected markets  through a combination of capacity waivers and voluntary closure notices  reductions in work force by existing customers and or reductions in benefits purchased by existing customers  negative publicity and news coverage about us or litigation or threats of litigation against us  the loss of key sales and marketing employees  and the inability of our providers to accept additional members 
we could become subject to material unpaid health care claims and health care costs that we would not otherwise incur because of insolvencies of providers with whom we have capitated contracts 
providers with whom we have capitated contracts could become insolvent and could expose us to unanticipated expenses 
we maintain insolvency reserves that include estimates for potentially insolvent providers  where conditions indicate claims are not being paid or have slowed considerably 
depending on states laws  we may be held liable for unpaid health care claims that were previously the responsibility of the capitated provider and for which we have already paid capitation 
we may also incur additional health care costs in the event of provider instability where we are unable to agree upon a contract that is mutually beneficial 
these costs may be incurred when we need to contract with other providers at less than cost effective rates to continue providing health care services to our members 
in addition to our insolvency exposure  our providers have deposited security reserves with us  and in third party institutions 
because our access to provider reserves has  and may continue to be subject to challenge by the provider group or other third parties at interest  we could incur additional charges for unpaid health care claims if we are ultimately denied access to these funds 
in  the texas legislature adopted changes to legislation that affect contracts that our texas subsidiary enters into or renews with its delegated network providers after january  state regulators may take the position that this legislation provides that hmos are liable for paying individual provider claims that are otherwise the financial responsibility of the capitated physician group if the hmo does not comply with the oversight requirements of the legislation 
as of december   our texas subsidiary had contracts with two capitated network providers that pay their own claims  covering approximately  or of our texas membership 
we cannot predict whether the financial condition of our texas providers will continue to deteriorate 
to the extent that we do not accurately estimate the timing  amount or outcome of claims asserted against us based on providers with whom we have capitated contracts and who become insolvent  our results of operations or cash flows for a future period could be materially and adversely affected 
a disruption in our health care provider network could have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products and our profitability 
in any particular market  health care providers could refuse to contract  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  some health care providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions  or may be the only health care provider available in that market 
if health care providers refuse to contract with us  use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts  or place us at a competitive disadvantage  then our ability to market products or to be profitable in those markets could be adversely affected 
our provider networks could also be disrupted by the financial insolvency of large provider groups such as those that occurred in texas in a reduction in our membership resulting from disruptions in our health care provider networks would reduce our revenue and increase the proportion of our premium revenue needed to cover our health care costs 

table of contents our results of operations could be adversely affected by understatements in our actual liabilities caused by understatements in our actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for incurred but not reported ibnr claims primarily using standard actuarial methodologies based upon historical data 
these standard actuarial methodologies include  among other factors  the average interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are received and or paid  denied claims activity  disputed claims activity  expected health care cost inflation  utilization  seasonality patterns and changes in membership 
the estimates for submitted claims and ibnr claims liabilities are made on an accrual basis and adjusted in future periods as required 
these estimates could materially understate or overstate our actual liability for claims and benefits payable 
any increases to these prior estimates could adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 
if our claims processing system is unable to handle an increasing claims volume and unable to meet regulatory claims payment requirements  we may become subject to regulatory actions 
if our claims processing system is unable to process claims accurately  our ability to accurately estimate claims liabilities and establish related reserves could be adversely affected 
we have regulatory risk for the timely processing and payment of claims 
if we  or any entities with whom we subcontract to process or pay claims  are unable to handle continued increased claims volume  or if we are unable to pay claims timely we may be subject to regulatory censure and penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and results of operations 
in addition  if our claims processing system is unable to process claims accurately  the data we use for our ibnr estimates could be incomplete and our ability to estimate claims liabilities and establish adequate reserves could be adversely affected 
our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to adequately control our prescription drug costs 
overall  prescription drug costs have been rising for the past few years 
the increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs  direct consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry creating consumer demand for particular brand drugs  patients seeking medications to address lifestyle changes  higher prescribed doses of medications and enhanced pharmacy benefits for members such as reduced copayments and higher benefit maximums 
as a way of controlling this health care cost component  we have implemented a significant decrease in prescription drug benefits for our medicare choice members in almost all of our geographic areas in and expect to continue to decrease these benefits in despite these efforts  however  we may be unable to adequately control this health care cost component  which could adversely impact our profitability 
increases in our selling  general and administrative expenses could harm our profitability 
our selling  general and administrative expenses have been rising due to our continued investment in strategic initiatives and could increase more than we anticipate as a result of a number of factors  which could adversely impact our profitability 
these factors include our need for additional investments in pbm expansion  branding and advertising campaigns  medical management  underwriting and actuarial resources and technology  our need for additional investments in information technology projects  including consolidation of our existing systems that manage membership  eligibility  capitation  claims processing and payment information and other important information  our need for increased claims administration  personnel and systems  our greater emphasis on small group and individual health insurance products  which may result in an increase in the broker commissions we pay  
table of contents the necessity to comply with regulatory requirements  including the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  the success or lack of success of our marketing and sales plans to attract new customers  and create customer acceptance for new products  our ability to estimate costs for our self insured retention for medical malpractice claims  our inability to achieve efficiency goals and resulting cost savings from announced restructuring or other initiatives  and our ability to estimate legal expenses and settlements associated with litigation that has been or could be brought against us 
in addition  our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our revenue could increase due to changes in our product mix between senior and commercial products and expected declines in our revenue  and could be adversely affected if we exit medicare choice or commercial markets without replacing our revenue from those markets with revenue from other sources  such as our new medicare supplement product offerings 
if we do not generate expected cash flow from operations  we could be forced to postpone or cancel some of these planned investments  which would adversely affect our ability to meet our short term strategic plan 
we may not accurately estimate the amounts we will need to spend to comply with hipaa  which may adversely affect our expenses and or our ability to execute portions of our business strategy 
hipaa includes administrative simplification provisions directed at standardizing transactions and codes and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data 
we expect to modify all of our information systems and business processes to comply with hipaa regulations regarding standardizing transactions and codes 
we also expect to incur expense developing systems and refining processes and contracts to comply with hipaa security and privacy requirements 
we currently estimate that our hipaa compliance costs will approximate million in as well as another million in capital expenditures 
we continue to evaluate the future work and costs that will be required to meet hipaa requirements and mandated compliance timeframes 
to the extent that our estimated hipaa compliance costs are less than our actual hipaa compliance costs  amounts we had budgeted for other purposes will need to be used for hipaa compliance which may adversely affect our ability to execute portions of our business strategy or may increase our selling  general and administrative expenses 
we are subject to several lawsuits brought by health care providers and members alleging that we engage in a number of improper practices  as well as a lawsuit brought by the state of texas 
depending upon their outcome  these lawsuits could result in material liabilities to us or cause us to incur material costs  to change our operating procedures or comply with increased regulatory requirements 
health care providers and members are currently attacking practices of the hmo industry through a number of lawsuits brought against us and other hmos 
the class action lawsuits brought by health care providers allege that hmos claims processing systems automatically and impermissibly alter codes included on providers reimbursement claims forms to reduce the amount of reimbursement  and that hmos impose unfair contracting terms on health care providers  impermissibly delay making capitated payments under their capitated contracts  and negotiate capitation payments that are inadequate to cover the costs of health care services provided 
the jose cruz lawsuit filed in november alleged that we engaged in a number of purportedly undisclosed practices designed to limit the amount and cost of health care services provided to members  such as providing health care providers with financial incentives to restrict hospitalizations  referrals to specialist physicians  and prescriptions for high cost drugs  entering into capitated contracts with health care providers  since capitated providers have financial incentives to limit health care services  and 
table of contents manipulating determinations of whether health care services are medically necessary by excluding expensive procedures and treatments from being considered medically necessary 
in addition  as part of our lawsuit with the state of texas  the texas attorney general  or ag  alleges that we violated texas laws relating to prompt payment in connection with the administration of our capitated contracts with three insolvent physician groups 
on march   we entered into a binding memorandum of understanding  or mou  with the state of texas  the ag and the texas department of insurance  or tdi  setting forth the principal terms of a settlement of all of the pending litigation between the parties and related civil investigations by the tdi 
we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to meet the conditions required to cause the settlement to become effective 
these lawsuits  including those filed to date against us  may take years to resolve and cause us to incur substantial litigation expenses 
depending upon the outcomes of these cases  these lawsuits may cause or force changes in practices of the hmo industry  including our ability to settle disputes with our providers by arbitration 
these cases also may cause additional regulation of the industry through new federal or state laws 
these actions and actions brought by state attorney generals ultimately could adversely affect the hmo industry and  whether due to damage awards  required changes to our operating procedures  increased regulatory requirements or otherwise  have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows and prospects 
we are subject to other litigation in the ordinary course of business that may result in material liabilities to us  including liabilities for which we may not be insured 
from time to time  we are involved in legal proceedings that involve claims for coverage encountered in the ordinary course of business 
we  like other hmos and health insurers generally  exclude payment for some health care services from coverage under our hmo and other plans 
we are  in the ordinary course of business  subject to the claims of our members arising out of decisions to deny or restrict reimbursement for services  including medical malpractice claims related to our taking a more active role in managing the cost of medical care 
the loss of even one of these claims  if it results in a significant punitive damage award  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our exposure to potential liability under punitive damage theories may significantly decrease our ability to settle these claims on reasonable terms 
we maintain general liability  property  managed care errors and omissions and medical malpractice insurance coverage 
we are at risk for our self insured retention on these claims  and are substantially self insured for medical malpractice claims 
coverages typically include varying and increasing levels of self insured retention or deductibles that increase our risk of loss 
regulators could terminate or elect not to renew our medicare contracts  change the program or its regulatory requirements  or audit our proposals for medicare plans  all of which could materially affect our revenue or profitability from our medicare choice products 
the medicare program has accounted for more than of our total revenue in each year since cms regulates the benefits provided  premiums paid  quality assurance procedures  marketing and advertising for our medicare choice products 
cms may terminate our medicare choice contracts or elect not to renew those contracts when those contracts come up for renewal every months 
the loss of medicare contracts or changes in the regulatory requirements governing the medicare choice program or the program itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our adjusted community rate proposals for the contract year have been filed and approved 
in the normal course of business  all information submitted as part of the adjusted community rate process is subject to audit and approval 
we cannot be certain that any ongoing and future audits will be concluded satisfactorily 
we may incur additional  possibly material  liability as a result of these audits 
the incurrence of such liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents we compete in highly competitive markets and our inability to compete effectively for any reason in any of those markets could adversely affect our profitability 
we operate in highly competitive markets 
consolidation of acute care hospitals and continuing consolidation of insurance carriers  other hmos  employer self funded programs and ppos  some of which have substantially larger enrollments or greater financial resources than ours  has created competition for hospitals  physicians and members  impacting profitability and the ability to influence medical management 
the cost of providing benefits is in many instances the controlling factor in obtaining and retaining employer groups as clients and some of our competitors have set premium rates at levels below our rates for comparable products 
we anticipate that premium pricing will continue to be highly competitive 
in addition  brokers and employers may react negatively to adverse press associated with hmos in general or directly about us  and consequently look to alternatives such as indemnity products or self funded programs 
if we are unable to compete effectively in any of our markets  our business may be adversely affected 
recently enacted or proposed legislation  regulations and initiatives could materially and adversely affect our business by increasing our operating costs  increasing required capital amounts  reducing our membership or subjecting us to additional litigation 
recent changes in state and federal legislation have increased and will continue to increase the costs of regulatory compliance  and proposed changes in the law may negatively impact our financial and operating results 
these changes may increase our health care costs  decrease our membership or otherwise adversely affect our revenue and our profitability 
regulation and enforcement is increasing both at the state and federal level 
increased regulations  mandated benefits and more oversight  audits and investigations and changes in laws allowing access to federal and state courts to challenge health care decisions may increase our administrative  litigation and health care costs 
the following recent or proposed legislation  regulation or initiatives could materially affect our financial position proposed legislation and regulation could include adverse actions of government or other payors  including reduced medicare or commercial premiums  reduction of provider reimbursements  discontinuance of  or limitation on  governmentally funded programs  recovery by governmental payors of previously paid amounts  the inability to increase premiums or prospective or retroactive reductions to premium rates for federal employees  draft compliance guidelines from the office of inspector general that propose voluntary guidelines for pharmaceutical manufacturers to establish internal controls  which  if implemented  may result in pharmaceutical companies restructuring the financial terms of their business arrangements with pbms  hmos or other health service plans  proposed legislation and regulation to provide payment and administrative relief for the medicare choice program and regulate drug pricing by the state and federal government could include provisions that impact our medicare choice and commercial products  new and proposed patients bill of rights legislation at the state level that would hold hmos liable for medical malpractice  including legislation enacted in arizona  california  oklahoma  texas and washington  may increase the likelihood of lawsuits against hmos for malpractice liability 
the united states supreme court has ruled that state laws that establish independent review boards to which members can appeal when hmos deny coverage for certain treatments or procedures are not pre empted by the employee retirement income security act of  or erisa  new and proposed state legislation  regulation  or litigation that would otherwise limit our ability to capitate physicians and hospitals or delegate financial risk  utilization review  quality assurance or other medical decisions to our contracting physicians and hospitals  existing or new state legislation and regulation that may require increases in minimum capital  reserves  and other financial liability requirements and proposed state legislation that may limit the admissibility of certain assets  
table of contents state regulations that may increase the financial capital requirements of physicians and hospitals that contract with hmos to accept financial risk for health services  new and proposed state and federal legislation that would attempt to address increases in medical malpractice insurance premiums and tort reform  new and proposed legislation that permits and would permit independent physicians to collectively bargain with health plans on a number of issues  including financial compensation  state and federal regulations that place additional restrictions and administrative requirements on the use  retention  transmission and disclosure of personally identifiable health information  such as hipaa  and federal regulations that enforce the current hipaa administrative simplification deadlines of april for privacy compliance and october for data standards compliance  new regulations requiring protection of the integrity and availability of personally identifiable health information which exists in electronic form  including the proposed hipaa security standards  new regulations that place additional restrictions and administrative requirements on the transmission  processing and receipt of electronic data as required by hipaa  and existing or new state and federal legislation and regulations governing the timely payment and administration of claims by hmos and insurers  and imposing financial and other penalties for non compliance 
we may take charges for long lived asset impairments or dispositions  or restructurings that could materially impact our results of operations or cash flows 
in the future  we may announce dispositions of assets or product exits as we continue to evaluate whether our subsidiaries or products fit within our business strategy 
we may also record goodwill or long lived asset impairment charges if one or more of our subsidiaries with operating losses generates less operating cash flows than we currently expect 
in addition  as we refocus and retool our work force as part of attempting to improve our operating performance  we expect some positions to change or be eliminated  which could result in future restructuring charges 
we cannot be certain that dispositions  impairments or restructuring activities will not result in additional charges 
in addition  disposition or restructuring charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness  which could adversely affect our operations 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness 
additionally  the total size of our committed revolving credit facility was million  of which at least million was available for borrowing 
for the year ended december   our aggregate interest expense was approximately million 
our debt service requirements will increase if interest rates increase because indebtedness under our senior credit facility  which represented million of our debt as of december   bears interest at variable rates 
our significant indebtedness poses risks to our business  including the risks that we could use a substantial portion of our consolidated cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  including executing our business strategy of diversifying our product offerings and making planned investments in our branding campaign  the marketing of our specialty products and technology initiatives for further streamlining our operations  insufficient cash flow from operations may force us to sell assets  or seek additional capital  which we may be unable to do at all or on terms favorable to us  our level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns  and 
table of contents our debt service obligations increase our vulnerabilities to competitive pressures  because many of our competitors are less leveraged than we are 
our senior credit facility and our senior notes contain restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to expand or pursue our business strategy

covenants in the senior credit facility and our senior notes may impair our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies 
our ability to comply with these covenants and other provisions of the senior credit facility and our senior notes may be affected by our operating and financial performance  changes in business conditions or results of operations  adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control 
in addition  if we do not comply with these covenants  the lenders under the senior credit facility and our senior notes may accelerate our debt repayment under the senior credit facility and our senior notes 
if the indebtedness under the senior credit facility or our senior notes is accelerated  we could not assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay all outstanding indebtedness in full 
we could have to change our investment practices in the future to avoid being deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended  which could adversely affect our rate of return on our investments and our results of operations 
due to changes in accounting rules implemented in  our legal structure and our recent operating results  we may inadvertently fail the statistical test for being regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended  or the investment company act 
the investment company act requires registration of  and imposes substantial operating restrictions on  companies that engage  or propose to engage  primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding  or trading in securities  or that meet certain statistical tests concerning a company s asset composition and sources of income 
because we are primarily engaged through our existing operating subsidiaries in the health care and insurance industries and we intend our future operating subsidiaries to be engaged in these businesses or related consumer businesses  we believe that we are primarily engaged in a business other than investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in securities and that we are not an investment company 
we are able to rely on an sec rule that exempts us from the requirement of registering as an investment company for up to one year 
in the interim  we and our operating subsidiaries are seeking an order from the sec  declaring our hmo operating subsidiaries not to be investment companies so that we would 
table of contents be exempt from the provisions of the investment company act 
the granting of this type of order is a matter of sec discretion and  therefore  we cannot assure you that it will be granted to our hmo operating subsidiaries 
even if we were to receive an sec order  there can be no assurance that our business activities would not ultimately subject us to regulation under the investment company act 
if the sec does not grant the requested order  to avoid registration under the investment company act  we may have to restructure our subsidiaries or our investments so that we do not fail the statistical tests relating to asset composition 
these changes might include increasing the component of our investments held in government securities or refraining from buying or selling securities when we would otherwise not choose to do so 
this could have a negative impact on our results of operations
