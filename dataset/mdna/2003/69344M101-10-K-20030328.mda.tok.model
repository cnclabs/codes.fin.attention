forward looking statements in this document include our belief that operating income and operating income per share are meaningful measurements of our underlying profits  our belief that the structure of pmi s modified pool products mitigates the risk of loss to pmi from the less than a quality loans and non traditional loans insured by those products  and our belief that we have sufficient cash to meet all of our short and medium term obligations 
when a forward looking statement includes an underlying assumption  we caution that  while we believe the assumption to be reasonable and make it in good faith  assumed facts almost always vary from actual results  and the difference between assumed facts and actual results can be material 
where  in any forward looking statement  we express an expectation or belief as to future results  there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result 
our actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by us

results of operations consolidated results we use various measurements to evaluate our business and profitability 
in addition to our net income and net income per share  we use operating income and operating income per share to measure our performance 
our operating income represents net income excluding realized investment gains and losses  and non operating and non recurring items 
non operating expenses for the financial periods presented were litigation charges relating to a class action settlement  lease abandonment and relocation costs relating to the relocation of our corporate headquarters  and extraordinary losses relating to the early extinguishment of debt 
the non recurring item for the financial periods presented was the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle relating to the write off of negative goodwill 
we believe that operating income and operating income per share are meaningful measurements of our underlying profits because operating income represents income from ongoing operations excluding gains or charges that are infrequent or unusual in nature  or one time events reasonably unlikely to recur 
accordingly  we use operating income and operating income per share to measure the performance of our management team 
however  operating income should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with gaap 
our operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

the net impact was an increase to net income of million 
the increases in consolidated net income and net income per share in over were largely attributable to increases in premiums earned and interest and dividend income  partially offset by higher losses and underwriting and operating expenses 
the amount of premiums recognized as revenue for financial reporting purposes  or premiums earned  increased in over due to growth in premiums from title insurance  and modified pool insurance and 
table of contents primary niw by our us mortgage insurance operations and the corresponding growth in our primary mortgage insurance portfolio 
the inclusion of pmi indemnity s results also contributed to the growth of our insurance portfolio and premiums earned 
we acquired pmi indemnity  one of our australian subsidiaries  in september and included its results in our results of operations beginning in the fourth quarter of the increase in premiums earned in compared to was attributable primarily to an increase in the volume of primary niw by our us mortgage insurance operations and the corresponding growth in our insurance portfolio 
additional revenue discussions are included in the business segment sections below 
the decrease in interest and dividend income in over was the result of the deployment of capital into pmi plaza  a decline in our portfolio yield  and the cumulative adjustments for our australian operations as discussed above 
the increase in interest and dividend income in over was due to the returns on the net proceeds of our convertible debentures offering in july and the inclusion of pmi indemnity s investment portfolio

the growth in equity earnings from our unconsolidated strategic investments in over was attributable to the increase in our ownership of fairbanks to as of december  and the expansion of fairbanks special servicing operations  and to securitization activity by truman fund 
the increase in equity earnings in over was due primarily to growth in fairbanks servicing portfolio 
our losses and underwriting and operating expenses excluded non operating and non recurring items as discussed above 
losses and underwriting and operating expenses increased in over as the result of higher levels of claims for our us mortgage insurance operations and increased agency commissions for our title insurance operations 
the increases in our losses and underwriting and operating expenses in over were due primarily to increased expenses related to higher business activity for our title insurance operations and us mortgage insurance operations 
more details are provided below in our discussion of the business segments results 
the decrease in interest expense and distributions on the preferred capital securities in was attributable largely to partial repayment of our long term debt and preferred capital securities 
approximately million of the proceeds from our convertible debentures offering in july was used to extinguish portions of our long term debt and preferred capital securities during the fourth quarter of the increase in interest expense and distributions on the preferred capital securities in was due to the overall increase in our total outstanding debt resulting from issuance of the convertible debentures

pmi s niw does not include primary mortgage insurance placed upon loans more than months after loan origination 
in august  the mortgage insurance industry s trade association mica revised several categories of insurance that are reported by mortgage insurers to mica 
these categories included flow channel primary insurance  bulk channel primary insurance and pool insurance 
we implemented the definitional changes during the third quarter of  and pmi s primary niw and primary insurance in force reported through the third quarter of were based upon these newly defined categories 
as a result of the implementation of these definitional changes  a portion of the insurance that the mortgage insurance industry had traditionally classified as pool insurance was classified as primary insurance  and certain insurance that traditionally had been classified as primary insurance was classified as pool insurance 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  pmi returned to its traditional definitions of primary insurance and pool insurance that reflect more appropriately the way pmi structures its products and manages its risk 
accordingly  the operating and statistical results in this document  unless otherwise noted  are based on pmi s definitions 
the differences in primary niw and primary insurance in force under pmi s definitions and mica s definitions  as shown below  are primarily the result of reclassifications of primary insurance and pool insurance

pmi s increases in niw in and were driven by the significantly higher volume of residential mortgage originations in those years  due to the historically low interest rate environment and the pronounced refinance market 
total us residential mortgage originations in increased by approximately over to trillion  while total mortgage originations nearly doubled in volume from  as estimated by mortgage bankers association of america 
pool insurance pmi provides pool insurance coverage to lenders and investors for risk reduction  capital relief or credit enhancement for capital market mortgage transactions 
pool insurance is typically issued in negotiated gse and capital market transactions 
prior to  pmi offered pool insurance to two different customer segments lenders and the gses gse pool  and the capital markets old pool 
these products insure all losses on individual loans held within a pool of insured loans up to an agreed aggregate amount  or stop loss

modified pool insurance may be attractive to investors and lenders seeking capital relief or a reduction of default risk beyond the protection provided by existing primary mortgage insurance or to cover loans that do not require primary mortgage insurance

the growth in primary insurance and risk in force was driven by a substantial volume of primary niw  partially offset by policy cancellations 
policy cancellations increased by to billion in  and increased by to billion in downward movements in mortgage interest rates during and resulted in heavy mortgage refinancing activity  which caused the increases in pmi s policy cancellations and the decreases in pmi s policy persistency in and pmi defines persistency as the percentage of insurance policies at the beginning of the month period that remain in force at the end of the month period

the increase in was primarily attributable to new primary and modified pool insurance written and the growth of pmi s primary and modified pool insurance in force as discussed above 
the increases in and ceded premiums were the result of increases in the percentage of insurance in force subject to captive reinsurance agreements 
heavy refinance volume and a higher percentage of niw by lenders with captive reinsurance programs resulted in an increasing penetration of loans subject to captive reinsurance agreements in pmi s portfolio

upon cancellation of certain categories of policies  pmi refunds the portion of premiums that is unearned to the borrower or servicer

taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in and in the decreases were primarily due to a larger portion of income derived from pmi australia and fairbanks  which have lower effective tax rates 
our effective tax rate varies due to changes in statutory tax rates of countries in which foreign subsidiaries generate taxable profits  and to fluctuations in the taxable earnings of those foreign subsidiaries relative to total taxable earnings as a whole 
in addition  our effective tax rate is driven by the proportion of tax exempt earnings relative to total pre tax income

the pmi group s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program in the amount of million in in december and january  we repurchased million of our common stock  and there is no available balance remaining under the authorization 
on february   the pmi group s board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of million 
to date  no repurchases have occurred under this authorization 
the pmi group s available funds were million at december   an increase from the december  balance of million  principally due to dividend payments from pmi and aptic  offset by our additional investment in fairbanks and the repurchase of our common stock 
we believe that the company has sufficient cash to meet all of our short and medium term obligations  and we maintain excess liquidity to support our operations 
as of december   we had million of liquid funds in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments to meet ongoing cash requirements 
in  we reclassified certain highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from short term investments to cash equivalents 
the amount of the reclassification was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our investment portfolios hold primarily investment grade securities comprised of readily marketable fixed income and equity securities 
at december   the fair value of our consolidated investment portfolios which are designated as available for sale increased to billion from billion at december  as a result of positive cash flows from consolidated operations 
our investments are recorded at fair value  and the differences between the fair value and amortized cost  net of applicable taxes  are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
our accumulated other comprehensive income consists of changes in unrealized net gains and losses on investments  less realized gains and losses included in net income and currency translation gains and losses  net of deferred taxes 
we have a bank credit line in the amount of million with a major financial institution and there are no outstanding borrowings under the credit line 
the agreement expires on december  this financial instrument contains certain financial covenants and restrictions  including risk to capital ratios and minimum capital and dividend restrictions 

table of contents we manage our capital resources based on our cash flows  total capital and rating agency requirements 
as of december   our shareholders equity was billion 
our long term debt and other capital securities outstanding at december  was million  which consists of the following million senior convertible debentures due july   million notes due november   and million capital securities maturing on february  in july  we issued million of senior convertible debentures 
the convertible debentures are due in and are redeemable at our option beginning in the holders of the debentures may require us to repurchase the debentures on july     or  and in certain other circumstances  at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional interest  if any  to the date of purchase 
we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash  common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
if we elect to pay all or a portion of the purchase price in common stock  the shares of common stock will be valued at of the average sale price for the trading days ending on the third day prior to the repurchase date 
holders of the debentures may convert their debentures prior to the stated maturity under certain circumstances 
under the terms of the indenture  an event of default would occur upon a failure to pay when due any indebtedness for borrowed money of the pmi group or any of our designated subsidiaries  as defined by the indenture 
if there is an event of default on our convertible debentures  the principal amount of our convertible debentures  plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  may be declared immediately due and payable 
as of february   pmi  pmi australia and fairbanks were designated subsidiaries under the indenture 
we cannot necessarily prevent fairbanks from failing to pay or defaulting on its indebtedness because provisions of an agreement among the shareholders of fairbanks limit our ability to control fairbanks operations  and also because events of default under the agreements governing fairbanks indebtedness may result from events outside fairbanks or our control  including but not limited to certain actions by rating agencies with respect to fairbanks ratings 
our consolidated reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to insurance claims increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase was due to increases in the reserve balances for us primary insurance books of business as a result of higher levels of default  increases in the reserve balances for our title insurance business as a result of increased mortgage origination volume  and increases in the reserve balances for our australian mortgage insurance books of business  partially as a result of the strengthening of the australian dollar relative to the us dollar in pmi s claims paying ability ratings from certain national rating agencies have been based in part on the captive reinsurance agreements and on a capital support commitment from allstate insurance company  or allstate  pmi s former parent company

in the event allstate makes any payment contemplated by the runoff support agreement  which possibility we believe is remote  allstate will be entitled to receive  at its option  subordinated debt or preferred stock of pmi or the pmi group  as applicable  in return 
effective december   pmi terminated a capital support agreement dated september  in favor of its sister corporation  aptic  under which pmi agreed to maintain aptic s capital and surplus at an amount not less than that required for a fitch claims paying ability rating of aa  subject to an aggregate limit of million 
the support agreement was replaced on the same date by a substantially equivalent guarantee of the pmi group in favor of aptic  its direct subsidiary  under which the pmi group agrees to maintain aptic s capital and surplus at a fitch aa level subject to an aggregate limit of million

pmi s ratio of net risk in force to statutory capital  or statutory risk to capital ratio  at december  was to compared to to at december  critical accounting policies the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this report  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involved significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate a significant portion of our revenues from mortgage insurance premiums on either a monthly  annual or single payment basis 
monthly premiums are earned as coverage is provided 
annual premiums are earned on a monthly pro rated basis over the year of coverage 
single premiums 
table of contents are earned in proportion to the expiration of the underlying risk 
a portion of single premiums are recognized in income in the current period  with the remaining portion deferred as unearned premiums and earned over the expected policy terms 
the earning cycle for single premiums is a range of seven to years 
the premiums earning process begins with the notification of risk generally upon receipt of initial premium payment 
we recognize earnings for single premiums based on expiration of risk to match premiums earned with the related risk 
generally risk is higher in the earlier years of each policy  and thus we recognize a greater portion of premium earnings in the earlier years of a policy life 
single premiums written accounted for approximately of gross premiums written from mortgage insurance operations in the earnings pattern calculations are based on estimated expiration of risk and  accordingly  we review our premium earnings cycle regularly and any adjustments to the estimates are reflected in the current year s operating results 
in  we refined the loss reserve estimation process of our international mortgage insurance operations to be based upon a methodology and estimates consistent with those applied to our us operations 
in connection with the refinement in the provisioning policy  we updated the assumptions used to determine the rates of premiums earned and shortened the duration of the expected policy life of single premium products  which resulted in an acceleration of earnings in the first two policy years 
title insurance premiums are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the title insurance policy 
fee income of the non insurance subsidiaries is earned as the services are provided 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  or lae  to recognize the estimated liability for potential losses and related loss expenses in connection with a borrower default on their mortgage payments 
our losses and lae reserves are estimated based on unpaid losses and lae on reported mortgage loans in default  as well as estimated defaults incurred but not reported by the lender 
our loss reserves are determined by assumptions primarily derived from an analysis of default and recovery experience 
key assumptions used in the estimation process  including expected claim rates  average claim sizes  claim severity  and expected costs to settle claims  could have significant effects on the reserve balances 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience adjusted for current economic conditions and projected future economic trends 
we do not rely on a single estimate to determine our loss reserves 
to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates  we develop scenarios using generally recognized actuarial projection methodologies that result in a range of reasonable possible losses and lae 
each scenario in the loss reserve model is assigned different weightings to actual claims experience in prior years to project the current liability 
our estimate was approximately the midpoint of this range for  which represented the most reasonable estimate based on our analysis and assessment of current economic conditions 
changes in loss reserves can materially affect our net income 
the process of reserving for losses requires significant judgment of management and the establishment of loss reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty associated with key assumptions used in our analysis 
different estimates could have been used in the current period  and changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period based on the economic conditions 
we monitor the reasonableness of the judgments made in our prior year estimation process and adjust our current year assumptions as appropriate 
however  the loss provisioning process is complex and subjective and  therefore  the ultimate liability may vary significantly from our estimates 
deferred policy acquisition costs our policy acquisition costs are related to the issuance of primary mortgage insurance policies  including acquiring  underwriting and processing new business  as well as sales and marketing related activities 
we defer policy acquisition costs when incurred and amortize these costs in proportion to related premiums earned for each policy year 
the estimates for each policy year are updated regularly to reflect actual experience and any changes to key assumptions such as persistency or loss development 
we review our estimation process on a regular basis and any adjustments made to the estimates are reflected in the current year s operating results 

table of contents investment considerations general economic factors may adversely affect our loss experience and demand for mortgage insurance 
our losses result from borrowers inability to continue to make mortgage payments 
the amount of any loss depends in part on whether the home of a borrower who defaults on a mortgage can be sold for an amount that will cover unpaid principal and interest and the expenses of the sale 
favorable economic conditions generally reduce the likelihood that borrowers will lack sufficient income to pay their mortgages and also favorably affect the value of homes  reducing  and in some cases even eliminating  the risk of a loss from a mortgage default 
we believe that our loss experience could materially increase as a result of national or regional economic recessions  declining values of homes  higher unemployment rates  deteriorating borrower credit  interest rate volatility  war  terrorist activity or political instability  or combinations of these factors 
these factors could also materially reduce demand for housing and  consequently  demand for mortgage insurance 
the united states has experienced an economic downturn 
if this economic downturn continues or worsens  our loss experience could suffer and demand for mortgage insurance could decline 
if interest rates decline  home values increase or mortgage insurance cancellation requirements change  the length of time that pmi s policies remain in force and our revenues could decline 
a significant percentage of the premiums we earn each year is generated from insurance policies that we have written in previous years 
as a result  the length of time that insurance remains in force is an important determinant of pmi s revenues 
under certain of our master policies  the policy owner or servicer of the loan may cancel insurance coverage at any time 
in addition  the homeowners protection act of provides for the automatic termination or cancellation of mortgage insurance upon a borrower s request if specified conditions are satisfied 
factors that tend to reduce the length of time that pmi s insurance remains in force include current mortgage interest rates falling below the rates on the mortgages underlying pmi s insurance in force  which frequently results in borrowers refinancing their mortgages and canceling their existing mortgage insurance  appreciation in home values experienced by the homes underlying the mortgages of the insurance in force  which can result in the cancellation of mortgage insurance  and changes in the mortgage insurance cancellation policies of mortgage lenders and investors 
although we generally have a history of expanding our business during periods of low interest rates  the resulting increase of new insurance written may not be adequate to compensate us for pmi s loss of insurance in force arising from policy cancellations 

table of contents if the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations declines  the amount of insurance that we write could also decline  which could result in a decline in our future revenue 
the factors that affect the volume of low down payment mortgage originations include the level of home mortgage interest rates  the health of the domestic economy as well as conditions in regional and local economies  consumer confidence  which may be adversely affected by economic instability  war or terrorist events  housing affordability  population trends  including the rate of household formation  the rate of home price appreciation  which in times of heavy refinancing affects whether refinance loans have loan to value ratios that require private mortgage insurance  and government housing policy encouraging loans to first time homebuyers 
a decline in the volume of low down payment housing could reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance and therefore  our revenues 
since we generally cannot cancel mortgage insurance policies or adjust renewal premiums  our financial performance could suffer 
we cannot cancel the mortgage insurance coverage that we provide  except in the case of non payment of premium 
in addition  we generally establish renewal premium rates for the life of the mortgage insurance policy when the policy is issued 
as a result  the impact of unanticipated claims generally cannot be offset by premium increases on policies in force or limited by nonrenewal of insurance coverage 
the premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for the risks and costs associated with the insurance coverage we provide to pmi s customers 
the risk based capital rule issued by the office of federal housing enterprise oversight could require us to obtain a claims paying ability rating of aaa and could cause pmi s business to suffer 
on february   the office of federal housing enterprise oversight  or ofheo  finalized a risk based capital rule that treats credit enhancements issued by private mortgage insurance companies with claims paying ability ratings of aaa more favorably than those issued by private mortgage insurance companies with aa ratings 
the rule also provides capital guidelines for the gses in connection with their use of other types of credit protection counterparties in addition to mortgage insurers 
under the rule  which became effective in the third quarter of  ofheo tests the gses capital position every quarter 
pmi has an aa rating 
it is not apparent at this point that the finalized rule will result in the gses increasing their use of either aaa rated mortgage insurers instead of aa rated entities or credit protection counterparties other than mortgage insurers 
changes in the preferences of the gses for private mortgage insurance to other forms of credit enhancement as a result of the new ofheo risk based capital rule  or a tiering of mortgage insurers based on their credit rating  could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
pmi s revenues and profits could decline if we lose market share as a result of industry competition 
the principal sources of pmi s competition include other private mortgage insurers  some of which are subsidiaries of well capitalized  diversified public companies with direct or indirect capital reserves that provide them with potentially greater resources than we have  
table of contents federal and state governmental and quasi governmental agencies  principally the federal housing administration  or fha  and the veterans administration  or va  and mortgage lenders that choose not to insure against borrower default  self insure through affiliates or offer residential mortgage products that do not require mortgage insurance 
if we are unable to compete successfully  our business will suffer 
if mortgage lenders and investors select alternatives to private mortgage insurance  the amount of insurance that we write could decline  which could reduce our revenues and profits 
alternatives to private mortgage insurance include government mortgage insurance programs  including those of the fha and the va  member institutions providing credit enhancement on loans sold to a federal home loan bank  investors holding mortgages in their portfolios and self insuring  mortgage lenders maintaining lender recourse or participation with respect to loans sold to the gses  investors using credit enhancements other than private mortgage insurance or using other credit enhancements in conjunction with reduced levels of private mortgage insurance coverage  and mortgage lenders structuring mortgage originations to avoid private mortgage insurance  such as a first mortgage with an loan to value ratio and a second mortgage with a loan to value ratio  which is referred to as an loan  rather than a first mortgage with a loan to value ratio 
these alternatives  or new alternatives to private mortgage insurance that may develop  could reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance and cause our revenues and profitability to decline 
the ofheo risk based capital rule may allow large financial entities such as banks  financial guarantors  insurance companies and brokerage firms to provide or arrange for products that may efficiently substitute for some of the capital relief provided to the gses by private mortgage insurance 
many of these entities have significantly more capital than we have and a few have aaa ratings 
the ability of these companies to offer or arrange for the products described above will be dependent upon  among other things  how the ofheo risk based capital rule is interpreted and administered and the willingness of the gses to utilize such forms of credit enhancement 
our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if the gses were to use these products in lieu of mortgage insurance 
legislation and regulatory changes may reduce demand for private mortgage insurance  which could harm our business 
increases in the maximum loan amount or other features of the fha mortgage insurance program can reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance 
legislative and regulatory changes have caused  and may cause in the future  demand for private mortgage insurance to decrease and this could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
pmi depends on a small number of customers and our business and financial performance could suffer if pmi were to lose the business of a major customer 
pmi is dependent upon a small number of customers 
through their various origination channels  pmi s top ten customers accounted for approximately of pmi s premiums earned in the loss of business from any major customer  through the use of self insurance  other types of credit enhancement or otherwise  could seriously harm our business and results of operations 

table of contents mortgage insurers  including pmi  may acquire significant percentages of their business through negotiated transactions including bulk primary and modified pool insurance with a limited number of customers 
for one type of negotiated transaction  modified pool insurance  the majority of pmi s business in came through pmi s participation in a market outreach program offered by fannie mae in which pmi s modified pool insurance product enhances the primary coverage offered by pmi and other insurers 
this market outreach program allows lenders to take a more comprehensive view of a borrower s creditworthiness and expand the benefit of conventional financing to homeowners 
the loss of fannie mae as a customer of pmi could reduce our revenue  and if not replaced  harm our financial condition and results of operations 
pmi could lose premium revenue if the gses reduce the level of private mortgage insurance coverage required for low down payment mortgages or reduce their need for mortgage insurance 
the gses are the beneficiaries on a substantial majority of the insurance policies we issue as a result of their purchases of home loans from lenders or investors 
the gses offer programs that require less mortgage insurance coverage on mortgages approved by their automated underwriting systems 
if the reduction in required levels of mortgage insurance becomes widely accepted by mortgage lenders  or if they further reduce mortgage insurance coverage requirements for loans they purchase  pmi s premium revenue would decline and our financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
in the past  freddie mac has sought a permanent charter amendment that would allow it to utilize alternative forms of default loss protection or otherwise forego the use of private mortgage insurance on higher loan to value mortgages 
fannie mae has announced its intention to increase its share of revenue associated with the management of mortgage credit risk and interest rate risk by retaining mortgage credit risk previously borne by a number of other parties  including mortgage insurers 
the reduction by the gses in their use or required level of mortgage insurance could reduce our revenue 
products introduced by the gses  if widely accepted  could harm our profitability 
the gses have products for which they will  upon receipt from lenders of loans with primary mortgage insurance  restructure the mortgage insurance coverage by reducing the amount of primary insurance coverage and adding a second layer of insurance coverage  usually in the form of pool insurance 
under these programs  the gses may provide services to the mortgage insurer and the mortgage insurer may be required to pay fees to the gses for the benefits provided through the reduced insurance coverage or the services provided 
these new products may prove to be less profitable than pmi s traditional mortgage insurance business and  if they become widely accepted  could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
lobbying activities by large mortgage lenders calling for expanded federal oversight and legislation relating to the role of the gses in the secondary mortgage market could damage pmi s relationships with those mortgage lenders and the gses 
together with the gses and mortgage lenders  we jointly develop and make available various products and programs 
these arrangements involve the purchase of pmi s mortgage insurance products and frequently feature cooperative arrangements between the parties 
in  a coalition of financial services and housing related trade associations  including the mortgage insurance companies of america and several large mortgage lenders  formed fm watch  a lobbying organization that supports federal oversight of the gses 
the gses in turn have criticized the activities of fm watch 
these activities could polarize fannie mae  freddie mac and members of fm watch as well as pmi s customers and us 
as a result of any such polarization  pmi s relationships with the gses could limit pmi s opportunities to do business with some mortgage lenders 
conversely  pmi s relationships with these large mortgage lenders could limit pmi s ability to do business with the gses 
either of these outcomes could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the institution of new eligibility guidelines by fannie mae could harm our profitability and reduce our operational flexibility 
fannie mae is in the process of revising its approval requirements for mortgage insurers  including pmi 
we have been in discussions with fannie mae about its proposed guidelines  and we anticipate that the new requirements will be finalized during to be effective at a later date 
the guidelines as proposed would cover substantially all areas of pmi s mortgage insurance operations  require the disclosure of certain activities and new products  allow for other approved types of mortgage insurers rated below aa  and give fannie mae increased rights to revise the eligibility standards of mortgage insurers 
we do not know what form the eligibility guidelines will ultimately take or whether any new guidelines will be issued 
hud s proposed respa reform regulation  if implemented in its current form  could harm our profitability 
the us housing and urban development department  or hud  has proposed the real estate settlement procedures act of  or respa  proposed rule to simplify and improve the process of obtaining mortgages to reduce settlement costs to consumers  or respa rule  which if implemented would give lenders and other packagers the option of offering a guaranteed mortgage package  or gmp  or providing a good faith estimate of settlement costs subject to a tolerance level 
to promote the use of a gmp  qualifying packages would be entitled to a safe harbor from litigation under respa s anti kickback rules 
mortgage insurance and title insurance are included in the package to the extent an upfront premium is charged 
this could encompass some  but not all  of the premiums charged by a mortgage insurer or a title insurer with respect to a single loan 
inclusion in the package could cause settlement service providers  such as mortgage insurers and title insurers  to experience reductions in the prices of their services or products 
the public comment period on the respa rule terminated on october  the mortgage insurance companies of america submitted comments on behalf of the mortgage guaranty insurance industry  including pmi 
the american land title association  the trade association for title insurers  also submitted comments on behalf of its members  including our title insurance company american pioneer title insurance company 
we do not know what form the final rule will ultimately take 
hud has stated that it intends to publish the final respa rule in the spring of mortgage lenders increasingly require us to reinsure a portion of the mortgage insurance default risk on mortgages that they originate with their captive mortgage reinsurance companies  which will reduce pmi s net premiums written 
pmi s customers have indicated an increasing demand for captive mortgage reinsurance agreements 
under these agreements  a reinsurance company  which is usually an affiliate of the customer  assumes a portion of the mortgage insurance default risk on mortgage loans originated by the customer in exchange for a portion of the insurance premiums 
an increasing percentage of pmi s new insurance written is being generated by customers with captive reinsurance companies  and we expect that this trend will continue 
an increase in captive mortgage reinsurance agreements will decrease pmi s net premiums written  which may negatively impact the yield that we obtain on net premiums earned for customers with captive mortgage reinsurance agreements 
if we do not provide pmi s customers with acceptable risk sharing structured transactions  including potentially increasing levels of premium cessions in captive mortgage reinsurance agreements  pmi s competitive position may suffer 
the premiums pmi charges for mortgage insurance on less than a quality loans and non traditional loans  and the associated investment income  may not be adequate to compensate for future losses from these products 
pmi s primary insurance and modified pool insurance written includes less than a quality loans and non traditional loans 
the credit quality  loss development and persistency  which is the percentage of insurance policies at the beginning of a month period that remain in force at the end of the period  on these loans can vary significantly from pmi s traditional a quality loan business 
we have experienced higher default rates for these loans and expect that trend to continue 
we cannot be sure that this book of business will generate the same 
table of contents returns as pmi s standard business or that the premiums that pmi charges on less than a quality loans and non traditional loans will adequately offset the associated risk 
pmi s primary risk in force consists of mortgage loans with high loan to value ratios  which generally result in more claims than mortgage loans with lower loan to value ratios 
at december   approximately of pmi s primary risk in force consisted of mortgages with loan to value ratios greater than but less than or equal to  which we refer to as s 
risk in force is the dollar amount equal to the product of each individual insured mortgage loan s current principal balance and the percentage specified in the insurance policy of the claim amount that would be payable if a claim were made 
in our experience  s have higher claims frequency rates than mortgages with loan to value ratios greater than but less than or equal to  which we refer to as s 
of pmi s primary risk in force consisted of mortgages with loan to value ratios greater than but less than or equal to  which we refer to as s 
in our experience s have higher claims frequency rates than s 
we also insure mortgages with loan to value ratios greater than  which we believe have claims frequency rates higher than s 
in  of pmi s primary risk in force consisted of mortgages with loan to value ratios greater than of pmi s primary risk in force consisted of adjustable rate mortgages  which we refer to as arms 
in our experience  although arms have lower initial interest rates  arms have claims frequency rates that exceed the rates associated with pmi s book of business as a whole 
the concentration of primary insurance in force in relatively few states could increase claims and losses and harm our financial performance 
in addition to being affected by nationwide economic conditions  we could be particularly affected by economic downturns in specific regions of the united states where a large portion of pmi s business is concentrated 
in addition  refinancing of mortgage loans can have the effect of concentrating pmi s insurance in force in economically weaker areas because mortgages in areas experiencing appreciation of home values are less likely to require mortgage insurance at the time of refinancing than are mortgages in areas experiencing limited or no appreciation of home values 
we delegate underwriting authority to mortgage lenders that may cause us to insure unacceptably risky mortgage loans  which could increase claims and losses 
the majority of pmi s new insurance written is underwritten pursuant to a delegated underwriting program 
once a mortgage lender is accepted into pmi s delegated underwriting program  that mortgage lender may determine whether mortgage loans meet pmi s program guidelines and may commit us to issue mortgage insurance 
we expect to continue offering delegated underwriting to approved lenders and may expand the availability of delegated underwriting to additional customers 
if an approved lender commits us to insure a mortgage loan  we may not refuse to insure  or rescind coverage on  that loan even if we reevaluate that loan s risk profile or the lender failed to follow pmi s delegated underwriting guidelines  except in very limited circumstances 
therefore  an approved lender could cause us to insure mortgage loans with unacceptable risk profiles prior to pmi s termination of the lender s delegated underwriting authority 
if we fail to properly underwrite mortgage loans under pmi s contract underwriting services  we may be required to assume the cost of repurchasing those loans 
in addition  we may not be able to recruit a sufficient number of qualified underwriting personnel 
we provide contract underwriting services for a fee 
these services help pmi s customers to improve the efficiency and quality of their operations by outsourcing all or part of their mortgage loan underwriting to us 
as 
table of contents a part of pmi s contract underwriting services  we provide monetary and other remedies to pmi s customers in the event that we fail to properly underwrite a mortgage loan 
such remedies may include the purchase of additional mortgage insurance  assumption of some or all of the costs of repurchasing insured and uninsured loans from the gses and other investors  or the provision of indemnification to customers in the event that the loans default for varying reasons  including  but not limited to  underwriting errors 
generally  the scope of these remedies is in addition to those contained in pmi s master policies 
the number of remedies we provided in increased compared to worsening economic conditions or other factors that could continue to increase pmi s default rate could also cause the number and severity of the remedies that must be offered by pmi s wholly owned subsidiary  pmi mortgage services co  to increase 
such an increase could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
there are limitations on the number of available underwriting personnel and heavy price competition among mortgage insurance companies 
pmi s inability to recruit and maintain a sufficient number of qualified underwriters or any significant increase in the cost we incur to satisfy pmi s underwriting services obligations could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
pmi s loss experience may increase as pmi s policies continue to age 
the majority of claims with respect to primary insurance written through pmi s flow channel have historically occurred during the third through the sixth years after issuance of the policies 
as of december   approximately of pmi s risk in force was written after december  as a result  we believe pmi s loss experience may increase as pmi s policies continue to age 
if the claim frequency  which is the percentage of loans insured that have resulted in a paid claim  on pmi s risk in force significantly exceeds the claim frequency that was assumed in setting pmi s premium rates  our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows would be harmed 
our loss reserves may be insufficient to cover claims paid and loss related expenses incurred 
we establish loss reserves to recognize the liability for unpaid losses related to insurance in force on mortgages that are in default 
these loss reserves are based upon our estimates of the claim rate and average claim amounts  as well as the estimated costs  including legal and other fees  of settling claims 
these estimates are regularly reviewed and updated using currently available information 
any adjustments  which may be material  resulting from these reviews are reflected in our consolidated results of operations 
our reserves may not be adequate to cover ultimate loss development on incurred defaults 
our financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed if our reserve estimates are insufficient to cover the actual related claims paid and loss related expenses incurred 
if we are unable to introduce and successfully market new products and programs  our competitive position could suffer 
from time to time  we introduce new mortgage insurance products or programs 
our competitive position and financial performance could suffer if we experience delays in introducing competitive new products and programs or if these products or programs are less profitable than our existing products and programs 
pmi s settlement in the baynham litigation contains a three year injunction terminating on december  which relates  in part  to the terms upon which we offer certain products and services 
as some of pmi s competitors have not agreed to abide by the terms of the injunction  pmi s compliance with the injunction could inhibit its ability to compete with respect to the offering of new products and structures through the end of this year  and this could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if our claims paying ability is downgraded below aa  mortgage lenders and the mortgage securitization market may not purchase mortgages or mortgage backed securities insured by us  which could materially harm our financial performance 
the claims paying ability of pmi  our largest wholly owned subsidiary  is currently rated aa excellent by standard and poor s  or s p  aa excellent by moody s investor service  or moody s  and aa very strong by fitch ratings  or fitch 
these ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by one or more of the rating agencies 
these ratings are based on factors relevant to pmi s policyholders and are not applicable to our common stock or outstanding debt 
the rating agencies could lower or withdraw our ratings at any time as a result of a number of factors  including underwriting or investment losses  the necessity to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries pursuant to capital support agreements  other adverse developments in pmi s financial condition or results of operations  or changes in the views of rating agencies of our risk profile 
if pmi s claims paying ability rating falls below aa from s p or aa from moody s  investors  including fannie mae and freddie mac  will not purchase mortgages insured by us  which would seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
in january  fitch announced that it had revised its rating outlook for the us private mortgage insurance industry from stable to negative  due to a variety of factors affecting the industry s long term fundamentals 
fitch currently maintains a stable rating outlook on all eight us private mortgage insurers  including pmi  but it has stated that it may change some insurers rating outlooks to negative in our ongoing ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and meet our obligations primarily depends upon the receipt of dividends and returns of capital from our insurance subsidiaries and our investment income 
our principal sources of funds are dividends from our subsidiaries  investment income and funds that may be raised from time to time in the capital markets 
factors that may affect our ability to maintain and meet our capital and liquidity needs include the level and severity of claims experienced by our insurance subsidiaries  the performance of the financial markets  standards and factors used by various credit rating agencies  financial covenants in our credit agreements  and standards imposed by state insurance regulators relating to the payment of dividends by insurance companies 
any significant change in these factors could prevent us from being able to maintain the capital resources required to meet our business needs 
an increase in pmi s risk to capital ratio could prevent it from writing new insurance  which would seriously harm our financial performance 
the state of arizona  pmi s state of domicile for insurance regulatory purposes  and other states limit the amount of insurance risk that may be written by pmi  based on a variety of financial factors  primarily the ratio of net risk in force to statutory capital  or the risk to capital ratio 
other factors affecting pmi s risk to capital ratio include limitations under the runoff support agreement with allstate insurance company  which prohibit pmi from paying any dividends if  after the payment of the dividend  pmi s risk to capital ratio would equal or exceed to  
table of contents our credit agreement  and capital requirements necessary to maintain our credit ratings and pmi s claims paying ability ratings 
generally  the methodology used by the rating agencies to assign credit or claims paying ability ratings permits less capital leverage than under statutory or other requirements 
accordingly  we may be required to meet capital requirements that are higher than statutory or other capital requirements to satisfy rating agency requirements 
pmi has several alternatives available to help control its risk to capital ratio  including obtaining capital contributions from the pmi group  obtaining third party credit enhancements  and reducing the amount of new business written 
we may not be able to raise additional funds  or do so on a timely basis  in order to make a capital contribution to pmi 
in addition  third party credit enhancements may not be available to pmi or  if available  may not be available on satisfactory terms 
a material reduction in pmi s statutory capital  whether resulting from underwriting or investment losses or otherwise  or a disproportionate increase in risk in force  could increase its risk to capital ratio 
an increase in pmi s risk to capital ratio could limit its ability to write new business  impair pmi s ability to pay dividends to the pmi group and seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our international insurance subsidiaries subject us to numerous risks associated with international operations 
we have subsidiaries in australia and europe 
we have committed and may in the future commit additional significant resources to expand our international operations 
accordingly  we are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities 
these risks include the need for regulatory and third party approvals  challenges in attracting and retaining key foreign based employees  customers and business partners in international markets  economic downturns in the foreign mortgage origination markets targeted  particularly the economies of australia and europe  interest rate volatility in a variety of countries  unexpected changes in foreign regulations and laws  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  potentially adverse tax consequences  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  potential increases in the level of defaults and claims on policies insured by foreign based subsidiaries  the need to integrate our domestic insurance subsidiaries risk management technology systems and products with those of our foreign operations  the need to successfully develop and market products appropriate to the foreign market  including the development and marketing of credit enhancement products to european lenders and mortgage securitizations  pmi australia s loss of a significant customer  risks related to global economic turbulence  and war  terrorist activity and political instability 

table of contents the performance of our unconsolidated strategic investments could harm our consolidated financial results 
we have made significant investments in the equity securities of several privately held companies  including fairbanks  which is the parent company of fairbanks capital  a third party servicer of single family residential mortgages specializing in the resolution of nonperforming  subperforming  subprime  alternative a and home equity loans  ram re holdings  which are the holding companies for ram re  a financial guaranty reinsurance company based in bermuda  cmg  which offers mortgage insurance for loans originated by credit unions  and truman  which is the general partner and majority owner of truman fund  a purchaser of residential whole loans 
fairbanks  ram re holdings  cmg and truman are accounted for on the equity method of accounting in our consolidated financial statements 
our investments in these unconsolidated strategic investments totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december   and our equity in earnings from these unconsolidated strategic investments was million in  compared to million in although our ability to engage in additional strategic investments is subject to the availability of capital and maintenance of our claims paying ability ratings by rating agencies  we currently expect to make additional strategic investments in the future 
the nature of the businesses conducted by fairbanks  ram re and truman differs significantly from our core business of providing residential mortgage insurance 
accordingly  these companies are subject to a number of significant risks that arise from the nature of their business 
for example  fairbanks business is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and licensing by various state and federal agencies 
on the federal level  fairbanks business is regulated by  among other statutes and regulations  the fair debt collection practices act  the fair credit reporting act  respa  the truth in lending act and the home ownership and equity protection act of fairbanks is also subject to the laws of the states in which it is licensed as a debt collector relating to its practices  procedures and type and amount of fees it can collect from borrowers 
subprime servicers  including fairbanks  have come under increasing regulatory and public scrutiny 
in october  the federal trade commission  or ftc  informed fairbanks that it is the subject of an ftc investigation to determine whether fairbanks loan servicing or other practices violate or have violated the fair debt collection practices act  the fair credit reporting act  section of the federal trade commission act or other laws enforced by the ftc 
in march  senators barbara mikulski and paul sarbanes requested the us department of housing and urban development to initiate an investigation into fairbanks servicing practices 
failure to comply with applicable regulations can lead to  among other remedies  termination or suspension of licenses  class action lawsuits and administrative enforcement actions 
also in march  s p placed its strong residential subprime and residential special service rankings assigned to fairbanks on creditwatch with negative implications 
s p stated that the creditwatch placement reflected increased regulatory scrutiny of fairbanks servicing practices 
state and federal banking regulatory agencies  state attorneys general offices  the federal trade commission  the us department of justice  the us department of housing and urban development and state and local governmental authorities have increased their focus on lending and servicing practices in the subprime lending industry 
state  local and federal governmental agencies have imposed sanctions for practices  including  but not limited to  charging borrowers excessive fees and failing to adequately disclose the material terms of loans or servicing or collection requirements to borrowers 
it is possible that in the future  state  local or federal authorities will seek to require changes in fairbanks business  including reimbursement to borrowers of fees previously charged  impose fines on fairbanks  or move to revoke its licenses to operate as a servicing organization 

table of contents fairbanks is also subject to private litigation  including a number of purported class action suits  alleging violations of federal and state laws governing the activities of servicers 
we expect that as a result of the publicity surrounding lending and servicing practices  fairbanks may be subject to other purported class action suits in the future 
fairbanks has procedures and controls to monitor compliance with numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations 
more restrictive laws  rules and regulations may be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive which could hinder fairbanks ability to operate profitably 
our investment in fairbanks  and consequently our financial results  could be negatively impacted by the ultimate resolution of the litigation and or pending or threatened actions involving fairbanks 
ram re is also subject to various risks 
for example  ram re could be harmed by a downgrade or withdrawal of its claims paying ratings by one or more of the rating agencies or failing to establish itself as a significant market participant since it is currently the smallest of the financial guaranty reinsurers 
our unconsolidated strategic investments could also be harmed by interest rate volatility  the loss of key personnel and their failure to execute their future business plans 
fairbanks could also be harmed by a devaluation of its servicing portfolio 
we do not control the companies in which we strategically invest 
accordingly  we are entirely dependant upon their management to operate their businesses 
we may never realize any return on these investments and we may suffer a complete loss of these investments  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not control fairbanks and cannot prevent fairbanks from defaulting on its indebtedness  which default could under certain circumstances constitute an event of default under our convertible debentures 
under the terms of the indenture for our senior convertible debentures due july   an event of default would occur upon a failure to pay when due  or a default that results in the acceleration of  any indebtedness for borrowed money of the pmi group or of our designated subsidiaries in an aggregate amount of million or more  unless the acceleration is rescinded  stayed or annulled within days after written notice of default is given to us 
if there is an event of default on our convertible debentures  the principal amount of our convertible debentures  plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  may be declared immediately due and payable 
under the indenture  designated subsidiaries means pmi  pmi australia  pmi mortgage insurance australia holdings pty limited  or pmi australia holdings  and any other existing or future  direct or indirect  subsidiary of the pmi group whose assets constitute or more of the total assets of the pmi group on a consolidated basis 
under the indenture  a company is a subsidiary of the pmi group if we own or control at least a majority of its outstanding voting stock 
as of february   pmi  pmi australia  pmi australia holdings and fairbanks were designated subsidiaries of the pmi group for purposes of the indenture 
fairbanks utilizes various notes payable and line of credit arrangements to finance servicing advances that it makes in the normal course of business and to finance the acquisition of mortgage servicing rights 
these borrowing arrangements require repayment of the financed amount as servicing receivables are collected or in the case of mortgage servicing rights  using monthly amortizing payments not to exceed months 
financing counterparties include various wall street investment banks and national commercial lenders 
fairbanks total notes payable  cash and cash equivalents and shareholders equity as of december  were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   fairbanks owned approximately million of purchased mortgage servicing rights 
we cannot necessarily prevent fairbanks from failing to pay or defaulting on its indebtedness because provisions of an agreement among the shareholders of fairbanks limit our ability to control fairbanks operations  and also because events of default under the agreements governing fairbanks indebtedness may result from events outside fairbanks or our control 
for example  under some of these agreements  a default may 
table of contents result from acts by affiliates of fairbanks  which may include entities over which fairbanks does not have complete control 
in addition  a default may occur as a result of certain actions by rating agencies with respect to fairbanks ratings 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  we may not have sufficient funds to pay the amounts due under our convertible debentures 
if we do not have sufficient funds on hand or available to us through the declaration and payment of dividends by our subsidiaries which dividends are subject to significant restrictions  we will need to seek additional financing to obtain the cash due on the convertible debentures 
additional financing may not be available to us in the amounts necessary or on terms we deem favorable 
if we are unable to keep pace with the technological demands of our customers or with the technology related products and services offered by our competitors  our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 
participants in the mortgage lending and mortgage insurance industries increasingly rely on e commerce and other technology to provide and expand their products and services 
an increasing number of our customers require that we provide our products and services electronically via the internet or electronic data transmission  and the percentage of our new insurance written delivered electronically is increasing 
we expect this trend to continue  and accordingly  we believe that it is essential that we continue to invest substantial resources in maintaining electronic connectivity with our customers and  more generally  on e commerce and technology 
our business will suffer if we do not satisfy all technological demands of our customers and keep pace with the technological capabilities of our competitors 
while we intend to protest the tax assessments we received in and  and any future assessment we may receive  from the california franchise tax board  there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these protests 
in the fourth quarter of  we received a notice of assessment from the california franchise tax board  or ftb  for in the amount of million  not including the federal tax benefits from the payment of such assessment or interest that might be included on amounts  if any  ultimately paid to the ftb 
in the first quarter of  we received a second notice of assessment from the ftb for the years through in the amount of million  not including federal tax benefits or interest 
the assessments are the result of a memorandum issued by the ftb in april the memorandum  which is based partly on the california court of appeals decision in ceridian v 
franchise tax board  challenges the exclusion from california income tax of dividends received by holding companies from their insurance company subsidiaries during the tax years ended on or after december  while we intend to protest the current and any future assessments  we cannot assure you as to the ultimate outcome of these protests 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the fair value of investments in our portfolio is interest rate sensitive and is subject to change based on interest rate movements 
a basis points increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a range of decrease or increase in the value of our fixed income investment portfolio 
these hypothetical estimates of changes in fair value are primarily related to our fixed income securities as the fair values of fixed income securities fluctuate with increases or decreases in interest rates 
at year end  billion of the billion total investment portfolio was in fixed income securities  including municipal bonds  us government bonds  corporate bonds and preferred stock 
the effective duration of our fixed income investment portfolio was years at december   and we do not expect to recognize any adverse impact to our income or cash flows based on the above projection 
as of december   million of our invested assets were held by pmi australia and were denominated in australian dollars 
the value of the australian dollar strengthened relative to the us dollar to us dollars at december  compared to at december  as of december   million of our invested assets were held by pmi europe and were predominantly denominated in euros 
the value of the euro appreciated relative to the us dollar to at december  compared to at december
