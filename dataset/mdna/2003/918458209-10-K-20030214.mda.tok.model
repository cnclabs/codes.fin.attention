item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the matters addressed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  with the exception of the historical information presented  contain forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under the heading risk factors following this management s discussion and analysis section  and elsewhere in this report 
overview during  the global telecommunications market  and in particular the fixed wireless broadband access market  experienced a significant downturn that has continued throughout and to the present 
we experienced dramatic decreases in the sales of our products and the adoption of our technology in  and our sales have continued at a reduced level through in this environment  in we determined that significant expenditures in our historical products and technology were not justified  and we reduced our workforce by approximately  from employees to employees 
during  our workforce in the wireless broadband access business further declined by seven employees  to employees at the end of these decreases reduced our research and development expenses and our sales and marketing expenses to minimum levels 
while we expect that the telecommunications market may recover over time  any such recovery may occur only slowly 
if the market does not recover in the near future and if our sales do not substantially increase from current levels  we will continue to incur losses  and may never achieve profitability 
since we have reduced our sales and marketing workforce  we may be unable effectively to sell and market our products without substantially increasing sales and marketing expenses 
furthermore  substantial uncertainty exists as to the ability of our existing products and technology to address this market if and when it returns 
our ability to develop and market products that effectively address the market as it evolves with new and competitive products and technologies may be limited due to  among other things  our limited research and development budget 
while we are continuing to operate our traditional wireless business  we are also actively exploring a variety of alternatives to this business  including the sale  divestiture  license or restructuring of a substantial portion or all of our current fixed wireless broadband technology or assets 
in the event of any such transaction  the value we may realize in the current market could be minimal 
in addition to our acquisition in july of shira computers ltd 
shira  a provider of software products for the prepress and publishing markets  we also continue to explore alternatives relating to the license  purchase or acquisition of other products  technology  assets or businesses 
we have invested  and we expect that we will continue to invest  significant time and resources searching for and investigating new business opportunities 
we may not be able to successfully effect any of these alternatives on a timely basis or at all 

table of contents we supply broadband wireless access systems used by telecommunications service providers to deliver wireless  high speed data connections to business and residential subscribers 
we sell our systems directly to service providers  as well as to system integrators that deploy our systems as part of their end to end network solutions for service providers 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we incurred net losses of approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
prior to our introduction of broadband wireless access systems  we developed and marketed cable broadband communication systems 
our first generation broadband wireless system was commercially deployed during the first quarter of for the local multipoint distribution system  or lmds  and the multichannel multipoint distribution system  or mmds  frequency bands 
our second generation  docsis based  broadband wireless access system was commercially deployed during the first half of for the lmds and mmds frequency bands 
on may   vyyo entered into a share exchange agreement with shira  an israeli privately held company that provides software products for the prepress and publishing markets 
this transaction allows vyyo to diversify its business by adding a different field of operation to its fixed wireless broadband operations 
shira employed employees as of december   and develops and provides digital prepress workflow solutions 
shira s solution automates the prepress production process and facilitates efficient collaboration between customers and printers tradeshops 
the share exchange agreement with shira and the shareholders of shira provided for the acquisition of all of the outstanding ordinary shares of shira  for an aggregate of  shares of vyyo s common stock after taking into account the for reverse stock split  which were issued on july  entities affiliated with davidi gilo  the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of vyyo and a significant stockholder of vyyo  owned an aggregate of of shira s ordinary shares immediately prior to closing of the transaction and received  of vyyo s shares in the transaction 
this transaction allows us to diversify our business by adding a different field of operation to our fixed broadband wireless operations 
the purchase price consists of shares of the our common stock  which are valued at approximately  based on the vyyo s average share price of  which was determined based on the closing price from may  to may   which includes two trading days prior to and two trading days subsequent to the public announcement of the acquisition  and  of direct acquisition costs 
the  shares acquired by the entities affiliated with mr 
gilo had a value of approximately  based on this average share price 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method under sfas the purchase price was allocated to those assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value of those assets and liabilities as of june  acquisition date 
identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired technology in the amount of  and customer list in the amount of  goodwill of  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired

amortization of identifiable intangible assets acquired was  of which the accumulated amortization of acquired technology was  and customer list was  for the six months beginning july  and ending december  the amortization of identifiable intangible assets acquired is included in the cost of revenues 
future amortization expenses of identifiable intangible assets on a fiscal year basis are as follows december  in thousands we performed an annual testing for impairment  based on shira s valuation as of december  the valuation method was based on shira s future cashflow discounted to their present value using a capitalization rate  which is appropriate to shira s characteristics and risks 
the impairment test resulted in an impairment charge of  related to the goodwill recorded upon shira s acquisition 
the decrease in shira s valuation is attributed mainly to the continuing slowdown in the us economy  which prevented shira from meeting its expected sales forecast and caused delays in shira s penetration of the market

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial conditions and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumption and conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  we determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include the following inventory valuation 
in  due to the dramatic slowdown in the telecommunications sector and the economy in general  we recorded a write down of excess inventory and purchase commitments of million 
our estimate was based on our expectations for sales of our products in the foreseeable future due to the uncertainty of selling our existing products if and when the market recovers 
in  inventory that was previously written down to zero by taking a charge of million was sold for the amount of million 
restructuring expenses 
in  we implemented a restructuring program that resulted in a reduction in force of approximately of our employees and in excess facilities and equipment  and accordingly  we recorded a charge of million 
in  we reversed an amount of  associated with employee severance and related benefits 
the remaining restructuring liability balance to be utilized relates to our obligations under the settlement agreement with har hotzvim and our anticipated loss under a noncancelable lease agreement until it expires at the end of 
table of contents legal proceedings

on january   har hotzvim and vyyo entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement  pursuant to which the parties agreed to dismiss har hotzvim s claims against vyyo ltd 
and vyyo inc and vyyo ltd 
s claims against har hotzvim  for a payment of million by vyyo to har hotzvim 
har hotzvim and vyyo waived any and all claims against each other in connection with this dispute 
on february   the district court of jerusalem approved and validated the settlement agreement 
the provision included under restructuring liabilities is sufficient to cover the agreed amount under the settlement agreement 
valuation of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
upon the acquisition of shira  we recorded identifiable intangible assets of  and goodwill of  we amortize the identifiable assets over a period of three years 
we periodically assess identifiable intangible assets and goodwill for recoverability through the estimated future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
our assessment for recoverability  based on shira s valuation as of december   resulted in an impairment charge of  related to the goodwill recorded upon the acquisition in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
products warranty 
we accrue for estimated sales returns and exchanges and product warranty costs upon recognition of product revenues 
the annual provision is calculated as a percentage of the sales based on historical experience according to the obligations to customers 
in  our revenues also derived from system integration products and services in connection with which we sold third party products  and accordingly we assumed additional warranty obligations 
in  we recorded a million decrease in the warranty costs under cost of revenues as a result of warranty expirations for certain customers and due to the dramatic decrease in product revenues  as no new material warranty obligations were created 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

net revenues in include revenues of  from the settlement of a dispute with a customer based on a license and development agreement entered into between the company and the customer in the decrease in revenues in and primarily reflects a slowdown in the global economy and the telecommunications industry  reduction of capital spending and further tightening of financial markets in the telecommunication industry  which has reduced the ability of our potential customers to secure financing and purchase equipment

the increase in cost of revenues and the negative gross margin in was attributable primarily to charges of approximately million for excess inventory and purchase commitments  due to the dramatic downturn in the global telecommunications industry and to the decrease in orders for and sales of our products 
while we expect that the telecommunications industry may recover over time  substantial uncertainty exists as to our ability to sell our existing products if and when the market recovers 
in  we purchased from adc telecommunications  a holder of approximately of our outstanding common stock  products and components in the amount of million

we are obligated to pay royalties at rates that generally range from to of revenues resulting from the funded projects up to maximum amounts of or of the funded amount 
as of december   we had repaid or provided for the repayment of grants amounting to million 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  facilities  equipment and supplies for our research and development activities

while we chartered the aircraft directly from the management company  the chartered aircraft is leased by harmony management  inc  of which davidi gilo and his wife are the sole shareholders 
payments made by us to the management company for the aircraft charters were ultimately paid to harmony management  after deductions for certain operating costs and charter management fees 
at the instruction of harmony management  the hourly rate charged by the management company for these charters was substantially less than the standard rate charged by the management company for similar charters to other unaffiliated parties

net interest income was million in  million in and million in  mainly from our cash and short term investment balances from proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings effected in we expect that our interest income will continue to decrease due to decreasing cash balances and reduced interest rates in financial markets 
income taxes 
as of december   we had approximately million of israeli net operating loss carryforwards from our israeli subsidiaries  million of united states federal net operating loss carryforwards  and million of state net operating loss carryforwards 
the israeli net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date and have not been recorded as tax assets because the losses are expected to be utilized during a tax exempt period 
the united states federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in various amounts between the years and the state net operating loss carryforwards expire in various amounts between the years and we have provided a full valuation allowance against our united states federal and state deferred tax assets as the future realization of the tax benefit is not sufficiently assured

as of december   through open market transactions  we repurchased  shares under the repurchase program for a total of million 
we did not repurchase any shares under the repurchase program in our liquidity will be impacted to some extent by the amount of share repurchases  if any  made under the repurchase program in the future 

table of contents our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and extent of establishing additional international operations and other factors 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to cancel or suspend our stock repurchase program  sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit arrangements 
additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to search for  investigate and  potentially  acquire new businesses  companies or technologies 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
effective corporate tax rates our tax rate will reflect a mix of the united states federal and state tax on our united states income and israeli tax on non exempt income 
our israeli subsidiaries have been granted approved enterprise status for several investment programs 
these programs entitled the israeli subsidiaries to tax exemption periods from two to six years on undistributed earnings commencing in the year in which they attain taxable income and a reduced corporate tax rate of for the remaining term of the program on the plan s proportionate share of income 
as of december   the tax benefits periods have not yet commenced  as we have not yet utilized our operating loss carryforwards 
the entitlement to these benefits is conditional upon fulfilling the conditions stipulated by the investment law  regulations published thereunder  and the instruments of approval for the specific investments in approved enterprises 
in the event of a failure to comply with these conditions  the benefits may be cancelled and we may be required to refund the amount of the benefits  in whole or in part  with the addition of inflation adjustment differences and interest 
if the israeli subsidiaries distribute a cash dividend to the parent company from income that is tax exempt  they will be taxed to a corporate rate applicable to such income between to  depending on the extent of the foreign ownership in the israeli subsidiaries 
we intend to reinvest the amounts of tax exempt income and we do not intend to cause distribution of such dividend 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas prescribes the accounting for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets  including the timing of liability recognition and initial measurement of the liability 
sfas requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  january  for the company 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 revision of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical connections sfas 
among other amendments and rescissions  sfas eliminates the requirement that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of the related income tax effect  unless such gains and losses meet the criteria in paragraph of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operation reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas is partially effective for transactions occurring after may  and partially effective for fiscal years beginning after may  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have any material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized when the liability is incurred 

table of contents under eitf  a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in eitf was recognized at the date of the commitment to an exit plan 
sfas states that a commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
therefore  sfas eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf it also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of the abovementioned standards to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
this statement also amends the disclosure provision of sfas no 
and apb no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
we have elected to continue accounting for employee stock option plans according to apb no 
 and we adopted the disclosure requirements under sfas no 
commencing on december  in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires the guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
it also elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued and to be made in regard of product warranties 
disclosures required under fin are already included in these financial statements  however  the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
under this fin entities are separated into two populations those for which voting interests are used to determine consolidation this is the most common situation and those for which variable interests are used to determine consolidation 
the fin explains how to identify variable interest entities vie and how to determine when a business enterprise should include the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and results of activities of a vie in its consolidated financial statements 
the fin is effective as follows for variable interests in variable interest entities created after january  the fin shall apply immediately  for variable interests in variable interest entities created before that date  the fin shall apply for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this fin to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors we may not be successful in selling our business or acquiring new businesses on favorable terms  or at all 
while we are continuing to operate our traditional wireless business  we are also actively exploring a variety of alternatives to this business  including the sale  divestiture  license or restructuring of a substantial portion or all of our fixed broadband wireless access technology or assets 
in the event of any such transaction  the value we may realize in the current market could be minimal 
in addition to our recent acquisition of shira  we also continue to explore alternatives relating to the licensing  purchase or acquisition of other products  technology  assets or businesses 
we have invested  and we expect that we will continue to invest  significant time and resources searching for and investigating new business opportunities 
we may not be able to successfully effect any of these alternatives on a timely basis or at all 

table of contents we and shira each have a history of losses  expect future losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we incurred net losses of approximately million in and million in as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
in response to the significant decline in our business and revenues which began in and has continued through the present  we have decreased our operating expenses in our wireless business  however  our expenses will continue to be significantly greater than our gross margin on revenues for the foreseeable future 
our revenues and gross margins may not grow or even continue at their current level and may decline even further 
if our revenues do not rapidly increase or if our gross margins do not increase  or if our expenses increase at a greater pace than our revenues  we will never become profitable 
in addition  our subsidiary shira incurred net losses of million in  and had an accumulated shareholder deficit as of december  of million 
we anticipate that shira will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
if our subsidiary shira fails to achieve significant market penetration and customer acceptance of its xpressi product suite and other software products in the graphic arts and prepress industry  its prospects would be substantially harmed 
the graphics arts industry  and in particular the prepress industry  have experienced little or no growth in recent years 
the industry is highly fragmented and many vendors operate in this market 
in addition  customers and prospective customers of shira and other vendors that have already invested in significant amounts of printing and prepress equipment and software may not be willing or able to upgrade printing systems or increase expenditures for printing or prepress  especially in the current slow global economy 
these factors contribute to an environment characterized by intense competition  lower expenditures by customers and fewer sales opportunities for shira 
in  shira s sales were minimal 
shira will be successful only if it is able to penetrate this market and substantially increase its market share in this industry 
if shira is unable to do so  its business would be harmed and its prospects significantly diminished 
shira s workflow product  xpressi  is new and relatively unknown  and shira may be unable to generate market acceptance of this product 
shira s recently introduced product  xpressi  is an advanced workflow solution  and shira s business prospects depend in large part on the success of this product in the market 
however  to date  shira has only begun to install this product with customers  and there are therefore only a very limited number of references for this product with which prospective customers can inquire 
in addition  the success of xpressi will depend on its ability to function effectively on many different customers systems 
since xpressi is new and currently installed with only a few customers  shira may have difficulty in effectively integrating the product into customers systems such that the product functions properly with each customer s system 
in addition  the printing prepress market is conservative and slow to adopt new technologies and methodologies 
shira is also generally considered in the industry as a small company offering software shelf products rather than as a provider of integrated workflow solutions 
as a result of these factors  shira may be unable to convince customers to adopt this product 
if shira is unable to sell xpressi on a large scale  shira s business and prospects would be substantially harmed 
since we have significantly reduced our workforce and expenses  we may not be able to address successfully the telecommunications market if and when it recovers 
during  the global telecommunications market  and in particular the fixed wireless broadband access market  experienced a significant downturn 
we experienced dramatic decreases in the sales of our products and the adoption of our technology in  and our sales have continued at a reduced level through in this environment  in we determined that significant expenditures in our historical products and technology were not justified  and we reduced our workforce by approximately  from employees to 
table of contents employees 
during  our workforce in the wireless broadband access business further declined by seven employees  to employees at the end of as a result of these reductions  we have reduced our research and development expenses and our sales and marketing expenses to what we believe are minimum levels 
while we expect that the telecommunications market may recover over time  any such recovery may occur only slowly 
if the market does not recover in the near future and if our sales do not substantially increase from current levels  we will continue to incur losses  and may never achieve profitability 
since we have reduced our sales and marketing workforce  we may be unable effectively to sell and market our products without substantially increasing sales and marketing expenses 
furthermore  substantial uncertainty exists as to the ability of our existing products and technology to address this market when it returns 
moreover  our ability to develop and market products that effectively address the market as it evolves with new and competitive products and technologies may be limited due to  among other things  our limited research and development budget 
if broadband wireless technology or our implementation of this technology continues not to be broadly accepted  we will not be able to sustain our business and may need to shut it down 
our future success depends on high speed wireless communications products gaining market acceptance as a means to provide voice and data communications services 
because these markets are relatively new and unproven  it is difficult to predict if these markets will ever develop or expand 
the largest mmds license holder in the us  sprint  announced during that it is suspending any new deployments and acquisition of new customers 
the other major service providers  including worldcom  have ceased  delayed or reduced their rollouts and may further delay or reduce rollouts in the future 
in the event that service providers adopt technologies other than the high speed access and other than wireless technologies that we offer or if they delay further their deployment of high speed wireless communication products  we will not be able to sustain or expand our business and may be required to cease operations in this business 
if service providers and systems integrators do not promote and purchase our products  or if the telecommunications equipment market continues not to improve and grow  our business will be seriously harmed 
service providers continually evaluate alternative technologies  including digital subscriber line  fiber and cable 
should service providers or systems integrators  to which we may sell products in the future  cease to emphasize systems that include our products  choose to emphasize alternative technologies or promote systems of our competitors  our business would be seriously harmed 
in addition  commencing in and continuing through to the present  the market for telecommunications equipment significantly declined  which severely adversely affected the entire telecommunications industry  including service providers  systems integrators and equipment providers  and reduced the business outlook and visibility of the industry 
in connection with the deterioration of global economic conditions  many of our customers and potential customers are also currently unable to obtain debt or equity financing for deployment of their wireless access networks and therefore do not currently have adequate capital resources to purchase our products 
if the telecommunications market  and in particular the market for broadband wireless access equipment  does not improve and grow  our business would be substantially harmed 
if the communications and internet industries do not grow and evolve in a manner favorable to our business strategy or us  our business may be seriously harmed 
our future success is dependent upon the growth of the communications industry and  in particular  the internet 
the growth of the global communications and internet industries has slowed significantly over the past two years and these industries continue to evolve rapidly 
it is difficult to predict growth rates or future trends in technology development 
in addition  the deregulation  privatization and economic globalization of the worldwide communications market  which resulted in increased competition and escalating demand for new technologies and services  may not continue in a manner favorable to us or our business strategies 
in addition  the growth in demand for internet services and the resulting need for high speed or enhanced communications products may not continue at its current rate or at all 

table of contents the loss of one or more of our key customers would result in a loss of a significant amount of our revenues 
a relatively small number of customers account for a large percentage of our revenues 
in  dalager engineering inc accounted for approximately of our revenues of our wireless revenues  wuhan research institute of posts and telecommunication accounted for approximately of our revenues of our wireless revenues  andrew corporation accounted for approximately of our revenues of our wireless revenues  and other customer from a settlement dispute accounted for approximately of our revenues of our wireless revenues 
in  worldcom broadband solutions  inc accounted for approximately of our revenues  and wuhan research institute of posts and telecommunication accounted for approximately of our revenues 
we have not received any new significant orders from worldcom since  nor do we expect them to continue to deploy a significant number of cities in the foreseeable future 
we expect that we will continue to depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues in future periods 
the loss of a major customer could seriously harm our ability to sustain revenue levels  which would seriously harm our operating results 
in addition  many of our customers are dependent on obtaining funding for their deployments 
the continued inability of our customers to obtain such funding will adversely affect their deployments  which would adversely affect our business 
conditions in israel affect our operations and may limit our ability to produce and sell our systems  and a united states war against iraq could disrupt our operations and harm our business 
our research and development  final testing and assembly facilities  and contract manufacturers are located in israel 
a substantial portion of the operations of shira are also located in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations  including those of shira 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
hostilities within israel have dramatically escalated over the past two years  which could disrupt our operations 
in addition  the united states has recently threatened to declare war against iraq 
a military action by the united states against iraq would likely involve israel in hostilities and further disrupt relations between israel and its arab neighbors 
we could be adversely affected by any major hostilities involving israel  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its trading partners  a significant increase in inflation  or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel 
as a result of the hostilities and unrest presently occurring within israel  the future of the peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors is uncertain 
moreover  several countries still restrict business with israel and with israeli companies 
we could be adversely affected by restrictive laws or policies directed towards israel or israeli businesses 
our chief financial officer  one of our directors and many of our and shira s employees are based in israel  and many of them are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
our business cannot assess the full impact of these requirements on our workforce or business if conditions should change  and we cannot predict the effect on us of any expansion or reduction of these obligations 
because we do not have long term contracts with our customers  our customers can discontinue purchases of our systems at any time 
we sell our wireless broadband access systems based on individual purchase orders 
our customers are generally not obligated by long term agreements to purchase our systems  and the agreements we have entered into do not obligate our customers to purchase a minimum number of systems 
our customers can generally cancel or reschedule orders on short notice and discontinue using our systems at any time 
further  having a successful field system trial does not necessarily mean that the customer will order large volumes of our systems 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of our customers could seriously harm our operating results 
our new subsidiary shira also sells its software products pursuant to individual purchase orders with little or no penalty for cancellation or rescheduling  and its customers are not obligated to purchase a minimum number of shira s products 

table of contents we may not be able to successfully operate shira computers ltd 
or integrate shira or other businesses that we may choose to acquire  in a cost effective and non disruptive manner and realize anticipated benefits 
we recently acquired shira  a provider of software products for the prepress and publishing markets 
we also continue to explore investments in or acquisitions of other companies  products or technologies  including companies or technologies that are not complementary or related to our current wireless broadband access business 
we have no experience in the printing and graphic arts industry  and we may therefore be unsuccessful in operating shira as a profitable business 
in addition  we may have difficulty integrating shira s or other companies personnel  operations  products and technologies into our current business 
it also may be difficult to manage shira since its management is based on the east coast of the united states 
these difficulties may disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of shira or any other acquisition may not be realized 
future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and the incurrence of large and immediate write offs  any of which could seriously harm our business 
in addition  we expect that we will expend significant resources in searching for and investigating new business opportunities  and may be unsuccessful in acquiring new businesses 
the potential effects of regulatory actions could impact spectrum allocation and frequencies worldwide and cause delays or otherwise negatively impact the growth and development of the broadband wireless industry 
countries worldwide are considering or are in the process of allocating frequencies for fixed wireless applications  but not all markets have done so 
in addition  in october  the united states federal communications commission indicated that existing mmds license holders may be able in the future to deploy mobile services using the mmds frequencies 
if service providers in the us will use mobile technology such as g cellular technology in the mmds band  it will harm our business as vyyo s current technology does not support mobile services 
if the united states and or other countries do not provide sufficient spectrum for fixed wireless applications or reallocate spectrum in the fixed wireless frequency bands for other purposes  our customers may delay or cancel deployments in fixed broadband wireless  which could seriously harm our business 
internationally  including in the people s republic of china  there has been delay in the allocation of ghz licenses 
any further delays will adversely affect our customers deployments and could significantly harm our business 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate  which may cause our share price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future 
these variations result from a number of factors  including the uncertain timing and level of market acceptance for our systems and the uncertain timing and extent of rollouts of wireless broadband access systems by the major service providers  the ability of our existing and potential direct customers to obtain financing for the deployment of broadband wireless access systems  the mix of products sold by us and the mix of sales channels through which they are sold  reductions in pricing by us or our competitors  global economic conditions  the effectiveness of our system integrator customers in marketing and selling their network systems equipment  changes in the prices or delays in deliveries of the components we purchase or license  and any acquisitions or dispositions we may effect 

table of contents a delay in the recognition of revenue  even from one customer  may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period 
also  because only a small portion of our expenses vary with our revenues  if revenue levels for a quarter fall below our expectations  we will not be able to timely adjust expenses accordingly  which would harm our operating results in that period 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of investors in future periods  our share price will likely decline 
competition may result in lower average selling prices  and we may be unable to reduce our costs at offsetting rates  which may impair our ability to achieve profitability 
we expect that price competition among broadband wireless access systems suppliers will reduce our gross margins in the future 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of broadband wireless access systems will continue to decline as product technologies mature 
we may be unable to reduce our manufacturing costs in response to declining average per unit selling prices 
our competitors may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and may be less vulnerable to the effects of price competition than we are 
these declines in average selling prices will generally lead to declines in gross margins and total profitability for these systems 
if we are unable to reduce our costs to offset declines in average selling prices  we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
with respect to the business of shira  there are many providers of printing and prepess solutions participating in this market  and we believe that competition among these providers will increase 
this increase in competition is likely to result in price reductions and reduced gross margins for shira s products in the future 
increased competition could also reduce shira s sales and market acceptance of its products  and competitors could introduce products that would make shira s solutions obsolete 
competition may decrease our market share  net revenues and gross margins  which may cause our stock price to decline 
the market for broadband access systems is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
certain of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  distribution  marketing and other resources than we have and  therefore  may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and other developments 
in addition  many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and established relationships with system integrators and service providers 
our primary competitors are alverion inc  wi lan inc  netro corporation  harris corporation  remec  inc and zte corporation 
most of these competitors have existing relationships with one or more of our prospective customers 
we also face competition from technologies such as digital subscriber line  fiber and cable 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  and competitive pressures may seriously harm our business 
the prepress printing market is highly fragmented and is also characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  and changing customer demands 
shira competes primarily based on price and performance of its products  and shira s future success will therefore depend on its investing substantially in research and development to develop  introduce and support new products and enhancements in a timely manner to gain market acceptance of shira s products 
shira will also need to expand its sales and marketing efforts 
there are a number of competitors for shira s pdf workflow and other prepress products  many of which are larger and have greater resources than shira 
undetected hardware defects or software errors may increase our costs and impair the market acceptance of our systems 
our systems may contain undetected defects or errors 
this may result either from defects in components supplied by third parties or from errors or defects in our software or hardware that we have failed to detect 
we have in the past experienced  and may experience from time to time in the future  defects in new or enhanced products and systems after commencement of commercial shipments  or defects in deployed systems 
our 
table of contents customers integrate our systems into their networks with components from other vendors 
accordingly  when problems occur in a network system it may be difficult to identify the component that caused the problem 
regardless of the source of these defects or errors  we will need to divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to address the defect or error 
we have incurred in the past and may again incur significant warranty and repair costs related to defects or errors  and we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to these defects or errors 
the occurrence of defects or errors  whether caused by our systems or the components of another vendor  may result in significant customer relationship problems and injury to our reputation and may impair the market acceptance of our systems 
shira s products and some of the third party components used by shira in its products use complex imaging technology and software 
despite extensive testing  undetected bugs or errors may result in product failures from time to time 
if shira s products have an unacceptable failure rate  or have reliability or compatibility problems  shira will be unable to sell its products 
any such errors  bugs or other problems with shira s technology or products could result in additional development costs and expenses  delays in development  and costs associated with warranty claims by our customers 
shira s reputation and credibility with current and prospective customers could also suffer as a result of product problems or failures 
we depend on contract manufacturers and third party equipment and technology suppliers  and these manufacturers and suppliers may be unable to fill our orders or develop required technology on a timely basis  which would result in delays that could seriously harm our results of operations 
we currently have relationships with two contract manufacturers for the manufacturing of our fixed broadband wireless systems  which are located in israel 
these relationships may be terminated by either party with little or no notice 
if our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our systems in required volumes  we would have to identify qualified alternative manufacturers  which would result in delays that could cause our results of operations to suffer 
our limited experience with these manufacturers does not provide us with a reliable basis on which to project their ability to meet delivery schedules  yield targets or costs 
if we are required to find alternative manufacturing sources  we may not be able to satisfy our production requirements at acceptable prices and on a timely basis  if at all 
any significant interruption in supply would affect the allocation of systems to customers  which in turn could seriously harm our business 
in addition  we currently have no formal agreement or relationship with a manufacturer for our modem products 
our current inventory of modems will likely be insufficient to fulfill anticipated demand  and we may therefore be required to find a manufacturer in the near future 
our inability to identify and enter into a relationship with a manufacturer for our modems would harm our business 
in addition  during  we began to focus our resources on direct sales to service providers 
such direct sales require us to resell to service providers equipment manufactured by third party suppliers and to integrate this equipment with the equipment we manufacture 
we are particularly dependent on third party radio suppliers in selling our ghz and other products 
we currently have no formal relationship with any third party supplier 
if we are unable to establish relationships with suppliers  or if these suppliers are unable to provide equipment that meets the specifications of our customers on the delivery schedules required by our customers  and at acceptable prices  our business would be substantially harmed 
in general  shira integrates third party technology in its products and relies on third party service providers for a number of its products 
if any of these third party vendors or service providers would cease to develop and support its relevant technology or terminate the contract agreement with shira  then shira may not be able to support its current products or complete the development of new products or products software versions  and shira s products would not be able to compete with other providers products that are developed as industry standards 
these factors would require shira to invest significantly more effort and funding in searching for or developing alternative solutions  which could result in delays and increased costs  and ultimately in loss of customers and decreased market share 

table of contents we obtain some of the components included in our systems from a single source or a limited group of suppliers  and the loss of any of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenue 
we currently obtain key components from a limited number of suppliers 
some of these components  such as semiconductor components for our wireless hubs  are obtained from a single source supplier 
we generally do not have long term supply contracts with our suppliers 
these factors present us with the following risks delays in delivery or shortages in components could interrupt and delay manufacturing and result in cancellation of orders for our systems  suppliers could increase component prices significantly and with immediate effect  we may not be able to develop alternative sources for system components  if or as required in the future  suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of components used in our systems 
in such event  we might need to modify our systems  which may cause delays in shipments  increased manufacturing costs and increased systems prices  and we may hold more inventory than is immediately required to compensate for potential component shortages or discontinuation 
the occurrence of any of these or similar events would harm our business 
if we do not develop new systems and system features in response to customer requirements or in a timely way  customers may not buy our products  which would seriously harm our business 
the broadband wireless access industry is rapidly evolving and subject to technological change and innovation 
we may experience design or manufacturing difficulties that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new systems and enhancements  any of which could cause us to incur unexpected expenses or lose revenues 
if we are unable to comply with diverse  new or varying governmental regulations or industry standards in each of the many worldwide markets in which we compete  we may not be able to respond to customers in a timely manner  which would harm our business 
if we do not effectively manage our costs in response to the decline in the business outlook  our business could be substantially harmed 
although we have reduced our fixed broadband wireless operations in response to the decline in our business outlook  we will need to continue to monitor closely our costs and expenses 
if the market and our business does not expand  we may need to reduce further our operations 
because we operate in international markets  we are exposed to additional risks which could cause our international sales to decline and our foreign operations to suffer 
sales outside of north america accounted for approximately of our revenues in sales to china in accounted for approximately of our sales outside of north america and approximately of our revenues in we expect that international sales may account for a substantial portion of our revenues in future periods 
in addition  we maintain research and development facilities in israel 
our reliance on international sales and operations exposes us to foreign political and economic risks  which may impair our ability to generate revenues 
these risks include economic and political instability  our international customers ability to obtain financing to fund their deployments  changes in regulatory requirements and licensing frequencies to service providers  import or export licensing requirements and tariffs  trade restrictions  and more limited protection of intellectual property rights 

table of contents any of the foregoing difficulties of conducting business internationally could seriously harm our business 
because substantially all of our revenues are generated in us dollars while a portion of our expenses are incurred in new israeli shekels  our results of operations may be seriously harmed if the rate of inflation in israel exceeds the rate of devaluation of the new israeli shekel against the us dollar 
we generate substantially all of our revenues in us dollars  but we incur a substantial portion of our expenses  principally salaries and related personnel expenses related to research and development  in new israeli shekels  or nis 
as a result  we are exposed to the risk that the rate of inflation in israel will exceed the rate of devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar or that the timing of this devaluation lags behind inflation in israel 
if the dollar costs of our operations in israel increase  our dollar measured results of operations will be seriously harmed 
we depend on our key personnel  in particular davidi gilo  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and menashe shahar  our chief technical officer  the loss of any of whom could seriously harm our business 
our future success depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and key personnel 
in particular  we are highly dependent on the service of davidi gilo  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and menashe shahar  our chief technical officer 
we do not carry key person life insurance on our senior management or key personnel 
any loss of the services of davidi gilo or menashe shahar  other members of senior management or other key personnel could seriously harm our business 
delays and shortages in the supply of components from our suppliers and third party radio vendors could reduce our revenues or increase our cost of revenue 
delays and shortages in the supply of components are typical in our industry 
we have experienced minor delays and shortages on more than one occasion in the past 
in addition  any failure of necessary worldwide manufacturing capacity to rise along with a rise in demand could result in our subcontract manufacturers allocating available capacity to larger customers or to customers that have long term supply contracts in place 
our inability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity at acceptable prices  or any delay or interruption in supply  could reduce our revenues or increase our cost of revenue and could seriously harm our business 
third parties may bring infringement claims against us that could harm our ability to sell our products and result in substantial liabilities 
we expect that we may be subject to license offers and infringement claims from time to time 
in this regard  in early  and again in april  we received written notices from hybrid networks in which hybrid claimed to have patent rights in certain technology 
hybrid requested that we review our products in light of of hybrid s issued patents 
third parties  including hybrid or its successors  could assert  and it could be found  that our technologies infringe their proprietary rights 
we could incur substantial costs to defend any litigation  and intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following obtain licenses to the infringing technology  pay substantial damages under applicable law  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  or expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
we also may experience infringement claims based on shira s technology and products 
accordingly  any infringement claim or litigation against us could significantly harm our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  we may not be able to compete 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets and confidentiality and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
our pending or future patent applications may not be approved and the claims covered by such applications may be reduced 
if allowed  our patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength  and others may independently develop similar technologies or products 
litigation  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts  may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
any such litigation  regardless of outcome  could be expensive and time consuming  and adverse determinations in any such litigation could seriously harm our business 
because of our long product development process and sales cycle  we may incur substantial expenses without anticipated revenues that could cause our operating results to fluctuate 
a customer s decision to purchase our fixed broadband wireless systems typically involves a significant technical evaluation  formal internal procedures associated with capital expenditure approvals and testing and acceptance of new systems that affect key operations 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle associated with our systems can be lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control 
because of the growing sales cycle and the likelihood that we may rely on a small number of customers for our revenues  our operating results could be seriously harmed if such revenues do not materialize when anticipated  or at all 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  and if we are unable to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us  we may not be able to execute our business plan 
we expect that the net proceeds from our initial public offering completed in may  and our secondary public offering completed in september  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds for a number of uses  including acquiring technologies or businesses  hiring additional qualified personnel  and implementing further marketing and sales activities 
we may have to raise funds even sooner in order to fund more rapid expansion  to respond to competitive pressures or to otherwise respond to unanticipated requirements 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to increase our ongoing operations if necessary  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance systems or respond to competitive pressures 
this potential inability to raise funds on acceptable terms could seriously harm our business 
government regulation and industry standards may increase our costs of doing business  limit our potential markets or require changes to our business model 
the emergence or evolution of regulations and industry standards for broadband wireless products  through official standards committees or widespread use by operators  could require us to modify our systems  which may be expensive and time consuming  and to incur substantial compliance costs 
radio frequencies are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states  foreign laws and international treaties 
each country has different regulations and regulatory processes for wireless communications equipment and uses of radio frequencies 
failure by the regulatory authorities to allocate suitable  sufficient radio frequencies to potential customers in a timely manner could result in the delay or loss of potential orders for our systems and seriously harm our business 

table of contents we are subject to export control laws and regulations with respect to certain of our products and technology 
we are subject to the risk that more stringent export control requirements could be imposed in the future on product classes that include products exported by us  which would result in additional compliance burdens and could impair the enforceability of our contract rights 
we may not be able to renew our export licenses as necessary from time to time 
in addition  we may be required to apply for additional licenses to cover modifications and enhancements to our products 
any revocation or expiration of any requisite license  the failure to obtain a license for product modifications and enhancements  or more stringent export control requirements could seriously harm our business 
the government programs and benefits we receive require us to satisfy prescribed conditions 
these programs and benefits may be terminated or reduced in the future  which would increase our costs and taxes and could seriously harm our business 
several of our capital investments have been granted approved enterprise status under israeli law providing us with certain israeli tax benefits 
the benefits available to an approved enterprise are conditioned upon the fulfillment of conditions stipulated in applicable law and in the specific certificate of approval 
if we fail to comply with these conditions  in whole or in part  we may be required to pay additional taxes for the period in which we enjoyed the tax benefits and would likely be denied these benefits in the future 
from time to time  the government of israel has considered reducing or eliminating the benefits available under the approved enterprise program 
these tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at all 
the termination or reduction of these benefits would increase our taxes and could seriously harm our business 
as of the date hereof  our israeli subsidiaries have accumulated loss carry forwards for israeli tax purposes and therefore have not enjoyed any tax benefits under current approved enterprise programs 
in the past  we received grants from the government of israel for the financing of a portion of our research and development expenditures for previous products in israel 
the regulations under which we received these grants restrict our ability to manufacture products or transfer technology outside of israel for products developed with this technology 
we believe that our current products are not based on chief scientist funded technology and therefore are not subject to this restriction 
shira has also received grants from the government of israel for the financing of a portion of its research and development expenditures  and the regulations under which we received these grants restrict our ability to manufacture products or transfer technology outside of israel for products developed with this technology 
several of our directors and officers have relationships with davidi gilo and his affiliated companies that could be deemed to limit their independence 
several members of our board of directors  lewis broad  neill brownstein  avraham fischer  samuel kaplan and alan zimmerman  and our president and chief operating officer  michael corwin  have had professional relationships with our chairman of the board  davidi gilo  and his affiliated companies for several years 
these members of our board of directors previously served on the boards of directors of dsp communications  inc and or dsp group  inc  of which mr 
gilo was formerly the controlling stockholder and the chairman of the board  and mr 
corwin previously served as an officer of dsp group 
in addition  avraham fischer is a senior partner of the law firm of fischer  behar  chen co  which represents us on matters relating to israeli law 
there are no family relationships between these directors and officers  and no member of our compensation committee serves as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our board of directors or compensation committee 
however  the long term relationships between these directors and officers and mr 
gilo and his affiliated companies could be deemed to limit their independence 
because our management has the ability to control stockholder votes  the premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay may be reduced and any merger or takeover may be delayed 
our management collectively own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  
table of contents these stockholders  acting together  will be able to control the outcome of all matters submitted for stockholder action  including electing members to our board of directors  approving significant change in control transactions  determining the amount and timing of dividends paid to themselves and to our public stockholders  and controlling our management and operations 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business consolidation involving us  or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares 
this concentration of ownership could also negatively affect our stock s market price or decrease any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay 
because the nasdaq national market is likely to continue to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations  the price of our stock may decline 
the market price of our shares has been and likely will continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or those of our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or technological innovations  introduction and adoption of new industry standards  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  changes in the market valuations of our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or partnerships  and sales of our common stock 
many of these factors are beyond our control and may negatively impact the market price of our common stock  regardless of our performance 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology and telecommunications related companies in particular  have been highly volatile 
our common stock may not trade at the same levels of shares as that of other technology companies and shares of technology companies  in general  may not sustain their current market prices 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may be the target of similar litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business and operating results 
if our stock price falls below per share  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
in order for our common stock to continue to be quoted on the nasdaq national market  we must satisfy various listing maintenance standards established by nasdaq  including the requirement that our common stock maintain a minimum bid price of at least per share 
under nasdaq s listing maintenance standards  if the closing bid price of our common stock remains below per share for consecutive trading days  nasdaq will issue a deficiency notice to vyyo 
if the closing bid price subsequently does not reach per share or higher for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days during the calendar days following the issuance of the deficiency notice from nasdaq  nasdaq may de list our common stock from trading on the nasdaq national market 
during the third quarter of  our stock price had a closing bid price below for over consecutive trading days  although the price has since increased to over as a result of the for reverse stock split effected by vyyo on august  vyyo cannot predict whether the market price for our common stock will remain above 
a delisting may negatively impact the value of the stock  since stocks trading on the over the counter market are typically less liquid and trade with larger variations between the bid and ask price 

table of contents provisions of our governing documents and delaware law could discourage acquisition proposals or delay a change in control 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if that change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 
specifically our board of directors has the authority to issue common stock and preferred stock and to determine the price  rights and preferences of any new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval  our board of directors is divided into three classes  each serving three year terms  super majority voting is required to amend key provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  there are limitations on who can call special meetings of stockholders  stockholders are not able to take action by written consent  and advance notice is required for nominations of directors and for stockholder proposals 
in addition  provisions of delaware law and our stock option plans may also discourage  delay or prevent a change of control or unsolicited acquisition proposals 
it may be difficult to enforce a us judgment against us and our nonresident chief financial officer  director and experts 
our chief financial officer  one of our directors  and some of the experts named in this report are nonresidents of the united states  and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the united states 
therefore  it may be difficult to enforce a judgment obtained in the united states based upon the civil or criminal liabilities provisions of the united states federal securities laws against us or any of those persons or to effect service of process upon these persons in the united states 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
substantially all of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars  although a substantial portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels  or nis 
we have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations that may arise from changes in foreign exchange rates 
in the event of an increase in inflation rates in israel  or if appreciation of the nis occurs without a corresponding adjustment in our dollar denominated revenues  our results of operation and business could be materially harmed 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
substantially all of these amounts consisted of corporate and government fixed income securities and money market funds that invest in corporate and government fixed income securities that are subject to interest rate risk 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy limit the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  all investments with maturities of three months or greater are classified as available for sale and considered to be short term investments 
while all our cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale  we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
we may not be able to obtain similar rates after maturity as a result of fluctuating interest rates 
we do not hedge any interest rate exposures 

table of contents quantitative interest rate disclosure as of december  if market interest rates were to increase on december  immediately and uniformly by  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately  or approximately of the total portfolio approximately of total assets 
assuming that the average yield to maturity on our portfolio at december  remains constant throughout and assuming that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances at december  remain constant for the duration of  interest income for would be approximately million 
assuming a decline of in the market interest rates at december   interest income for would be approximately million in  which represents a decrease in interest income of approximately  the decrease in interest income will result in a decrease of the same amount to net income and cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s cash equivalents and available for sale securities at december   over the remaining contractual lives
