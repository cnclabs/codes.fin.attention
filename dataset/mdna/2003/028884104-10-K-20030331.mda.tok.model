overview we are a leading provider of medical professional liability insurance coverage  writing this coverage in states throughout the country 
this insurance coverage protects physicians and other health providers from claims filed against them for alleged acts of medical malpractice 
medical professional liability insurance represented of our direct premiums written in in addition  we write workers compensation insurance in states  insuring a variety of business classes 
during  we also provided a limited amount of general personal and commercial coverage and participated in a health insurance program 
our policy liability limits vary by line and state 
in workers compensation insurance  state statutes dictate the coverage we offer our policyholders 
for medical professional liability insurance  most states allow physicians to choose their own coverage limits 
the limits of liability purchased by our medical professional liability policyholders differ by state 
in michigan and new mexico  the most common limits purchased by our policyholders are  per claim  with a  annual aggregate 
in florida  the most common limits purchased are  in all other states  the most common limit purchased is million per claim  with a million annual aggregate 
higher limits and excess coverage may be written in conjunction with special reinsurance arrangements 
we purchase reinsurance to limit risk on our individual exposures  stabilize underwriting results and increase our capacity to write insurance 
by purchasing reinsurance  we transfer a portion of our loss exposure to a reinsurer 
purchasing reinsurance does not discharge us from our obligation to our insureds 
if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations  we remain liable to pay the insured 
we have various reinsurance agreements in place 
in general  we retain the first  of a medical professional liability claim and  of a workers compensation claim  and reinsurers pay the portion of the claim in excess of those amounts 
important agency relationship the principal agency through which we write medical professional liability insurance is scw agency group  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
scw is owned by william cheeseman  our president and chief executive officer 
bridget cheeseman  mr 
cheeseman s adult daughter  is a vice president of scw and owns approximately of scw 
during the last three years  mr 
cheeseman has received no cash or other compensation  dividends or other distributions from scw and his only benefit from scw from this relationship is the potential appreciation of his ownership interest in that company 
if scw increases the amount of business it writes for us  scw will earn more commission revenue from us 
to the extent the increase in commission revenue we pay scw increases scw s profits  mr 
cheeseman s ownership interest may appreciate 
also  to the extent our financial performance as a whole improves or deteriorates  whether due to the business relationship with scw or otherwise  the compensation committee is likely to consider such improvement or deterioration in company performance when determining mr 
cheeseman s compensation 
scw has been a significant agent for us for many years 
the commission rates we pay to scw are either the same or less than the commission rates we pay to our other agents 
in addition  scw has agreed that  with limited exceptions  the only medical professional liability insurance it will sell will be written by the company 

table of contents the company is not required to sell insurance solely through scw 
we believe these factors create a more favorable agency relationship for us than we have with our other agents 
scw sells insurance written by several companies 
however  the commissions it receives on premiums it writes for the company typically account for to of its revenues 
direct premiums written for us by scw during  and totaled   and  respectively  representing  and of our direct premiums written during such years 
commission expense we incurred and paid to scw approximated   and  in  and  respectively 
based on financial information made available to us  we estimate scw s net profits on the commission revenue earned from us in to be approximately million 
we have not attempted to independently audit or verify the information scw has furnished  although we have no reason to believe it is inaccurate 
for purposes of this disclosure  we have estimated the net profits that scw earned on the revenue received from us by calculating the profit percentage that scw s net profit bears to its total revenue in and applying that percentage to the revenue earned from us 
we have put in place various safeguards to protect the company from actual or potential conflicts of interest arising from this relationship 
the commission rates we currently pay to scw were determined by negotiations between our marketing staff and scw s management and approved by our board of directors without involvement by mr 
cheeseman 
in rendering its approval  the board of directors considered the fairness of the agreed rates and determined they were fair to the company based upon  among other things  an evaluation of market rates and other company agency agreements 
a new agency contract is currently being negotiated by a special committee of our board of directors and scw management without involvement by mr 
cheeseman 
the new contract is expected to have an extended term and to provide for payment of commission rates which are at least as favorable to the company as those paid under the prior contract 
mr 
cheeseman is prohibited from acting as a director  officer or employee of scw and  pursuant to company policy  does not participate in day to day discussions between the company and scw or in decisions about whether to underwrite business proposed to be written by scw 
moreover  we apply the same underwriting rules to business written by scw as we apply to business written by other agencies 
these underwriting rules are generally filed with the regulatory agencies in the various states in which we do business and are established solely by the company in order to control the quality of business submitted by all agents  including scw 
we also monitor our loss experience on the business written by our agents  including scw 
an interruption in our relationship with scw  whether due to mr 
cheeseman s sale of his ownership interest in scw or otherwise  could significantly reduce our premiums written because scw represents such a significant portion of our premiums written 
in addition  because the commission rates we pay to scw are sometimes less than we pay to other agents  an interruption in our relationship could result in an increase in the commission rates we must pay and a decrease in our net income 
significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time 
the following policies are those we believe to be the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are actuarially estimated using the company s claim experience 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency 
when a claim is reported to us  claims personnel establish a 
table of contents case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
this estimate reflects an informed judgment based upon insurance reserving practices appropriate for the relevant line of business  and on the experience and knowledge of the estimator regarding the nature and value of the specific claim  the severity of injury or damage  and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
case reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary by the claims staff as more information becomes available 
reserves for claims incurred but not reported provide for the future reporting of claims already incurred  and development on claims already reported 
the reserve for claims incurred but not reported is determined based on historical loss trends 
we do not discount our reserves to recognize the time value of money 
we currently have a staff of internal actuaries who develop projections of ultimate losses that are used to establish recorded reserves 
management utilizes these actuarial projections  as well as qualitative input from the actuarial staff  and an independent actuarial firm  to establish a best estimate recorded reserve amount 
while management does not explicitly calculate an acceptable range of probable reserves  historical results have shown ultimate losses can vary from our initial estimates in a range of plus or minus 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate 
however  there can be no assurance that losses will not exceed the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  as future trends related to the frequency and severity of claims may develop differently than management has projected 
the assumptions and methodologies used in estimating and establishing the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are continually reviewed and any adjustments are reflected as income or expense in the period in which the adjustment is made 
investments 
investments represent our largest asset and are the primary source of funds to pay insurance claims 
all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale  which are those securities that would be available to be sold in the future in response to our liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates and asset liability management strategies 
available for sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes 
investment income includes amortization of premium and accrual of discount on the yield to maturity method relating to investments acquired at other than par value 
equity securities are carried at quoted market values 
fair values of fixed maturities and equity securities are determined on the basis of dealer or market quotations or comparable securities on which quotations are available 
mortgage loans at december  were carried at the unpaid principal balance  which approximated the fair market value as they bore current market interest rates at that date 
there were no mortgage loans at december  real estate is carried at historical cost  less accumulated depreciation 
realized gains or losses on sales or maturities of investments are determined on a specific identification basis and are credited or charged to income 
we periodically review our investment portfolio for any potential credit quality or collection issues 
we specifically reviewed for any securities that we considered to have any decline in market value to be other than temporary 
investments which are considered impaired are written down to their estimated net realizable value 
we utilize both quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods to evaluate the potential for other than temporary impairment otti 
at december   we established a reserve of million on investment real estate primarily due to depressed real estate prices and lower than expected cash flows 
additionally  we wrote down our investment in frontier bonds  in and million in we noted no other investments that required a write down for otti 
we did analyze million of enhanced equipment trust certificates we owned that were issued by delta airlines 
these certificates traded at of par at december  however  based on the economic performance of delta  its strong balance sheet position  and the fact that the certificates are collateralized by newer  fuel efficient aircraft  no impairment was deemed necessary 
during the year ended december   we generated approximately million of realized losses on the sales of securities 
the sale of one security in particular  united airlines bonds  generated approximately 
table of contents million of this loss 
management analyzed the united airlines bonds at september  and concluded that the decline in fair market value as of that date was temporary 
in the fourth quarter  united airlines filed for bankruptcy 
as a result of that event  management believed that the impairment was now other than temporary  and management made the decision to sell the security at a loss 
reserve for extended reporting period claims 
the reserve for extended reporting period claims coverage is recorded during the term of the original claims made policy  utilizing the pure premium approach  in amounts believed to be adequate to pay for estimated future claims reported subsequent to a current policyholder s death  disability or retirement 
amounts are estimated on a basis similar to the estimates made in respect of the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
changes in this reserve are reflected as an expense in the period in which the adjustment is made 
reinsurance 
in accordance with industry practice  we cede to other insurance companies some of the potential liability under insurance policies we have underwritten 
this practice  called reinsurance  helps us reduce our net liability on individual risks  stabilize our underwriting results and increase our underwriting capacity 
as payment for sharing a portion of our risk  we are also required to share a part of the premium we receive on the related policies 
we determine the amount and scope of reinsurance coverage to purchase each year based upon an evaluation of the risks accepted  consultations with reinsurance brokers and a review of market conditions  including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
our reinsurance arrangements are generally renegotiated annually 
reinsurance premiums and losses related to reinsured business are accounted for on bases consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
premiums ceded to other companies are reported as a reduction of premium income 
reinsured losses incurred are reported as a reduction of gross losses incurred 
under our primary professional liability reinsurance contract  the portion of the policyholder premium ceded to the reinsurers is swing rated  or experience rated on a retrospective basis 
this swing rated contract is subject to a minimum and maximum premium range to be paid to the reinsurers in the future  depending upon the extent of losses actually paid by the reinsurers 
we pay a provisional premium during the initial policy year 
a liability is recorded to represent an estimate of net additional payments to be made to the reinsurers under the program  based on the level of loss and lae reserves recorded 
we annually review the financial stability of all of our reinsurers 
this review includes a ratings analysis of each reinsurer participating in a reinsurance contract 
on the basis of this review  as of december   we concluded that there was no material risk of not being paid by our reinsurers 
we performed additional analysis on gerling global given its recent downgrade to b and actions by its parent company to put its united states subsidiary into run off 
despite gerling global s b am best rating at december   our review indicates that gerling global still has adequate surplus and cash flow  and we have not experienced any difficulties in collecting amounts due from gerling global  or any other reinsurers 
however  we will continue to monitor gerling global situation carefully  and may pursue an economic settlement or commutation if we determine that is the best long term course of action 
we believe that our reinsurance is maintained with financially stable reinsurers and that any reinsurance security we have is adequate to protect our interests 
however  our inability to collect on our reinsurance  or the inability of our reinsurers to make payments under the terms of reinsurance  due to insolvency or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes 
deferred federal income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
we review our deferred federal income tax asset on a quarterly basis for recoverability based on the availability of future taxable income in the years when the deductible temporary differences are expected to reverse 
our deferred tax assets primarily relate to deductible temporary differences dtd s for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums  as well as minimum tax credit carryforwards 
most of our dtd s reverse in the next three years and will more likely than not be realized as management has taken premium rate increases and other underwriting actions that are anticipated to generate taxable income in those years 

table of contents description of ratios analyzed in the analysis of our operating results that follows  we refer to various financial ratios that management uses to analyze and compare the underwriting results of our insurance operations 
these ratios are calculated on a gaap basis and include loss ratio this ratio compares our losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred  net of reinsurance  to our net premiums earned  and indicates how much we expect to pay policyholders for claims and related settlement expenses compared to the amount of premiums we earn 
the calendar year loss ratio uses all losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the current calendar year ie  related to all accident years 
the accident year loss ratio uses only those loss and loss adjustment expenses that relate to the current accident year ie  excludes the effect of development on prior year loss reserves 
the lower the percentage  the more profitable our insurance business is  all other things being equal 
underwriting expense ratio this ratio compares our expenses to obtain new business and renew existing business  plus normal operating expenses  to our net premiums earned 
the ratio is used to measure how efficient we are at obtaining business and operating the insurance segments 
the lower the percentage  the more efficient we are  all else being equal 
sometimes  however  a higher underwriting expense ratio can result in better business and improve our loss ratio  and overall profitability 
combined ratio this ratio equals the sum of our loss ratio and underwriting expense ratio 
the lower the percentage  the more profitable our insurance business is 
this ratio excludes the effects of investment income 
the statutory ratios will differ from gaap ratios as a result of differences in accounting between the statutory basis of accounting and gaap 
additionally  the denominator for the underwriting expense ratio for gaap is net premiums earned  versus net premiums written for the statutory underwriting expense ratio

medical professional liability direct premiums written in the state of florida for the year ended december  were million and the company reported net loss and loss adjustment expenses for that period of million in florida 
the florida department of insurance has approved the company s plan to exit this market and in october  the company began mailing non renewal notices to medical professional liability policyholders in florida whose renewals would have been effective in december florida law requires the company to offer extended reporting coverage  commonly referred to as tail policies  at the time of non renewal 
tail policies typically have written premiums of approximately two times the last annual policy premium 
the company expects that some physicians will opt for this extended reporting coverage  which will result in additional direct premiums written in the amount of these future premiums cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty regarding the number of physicians who will opt for the coverage 
the company is exploring various 
table of contents reinsurance options with respect to the premiums and risks associated with these extended reporting coverages 
in january  the company invested million in a start up insurance company managed by the company s former third party administrator who underwrote its florida medical professional liability business 
this start up insurance company  physicians insurance company  would seek to write as many of the tail policies as its capital and surplus levels would permit  thereby limiting apcapital s direct exposure to future losses associated with underwriting florida medical professional liability extended reporting period coverages

in the second half of  we encountered a large increase in reported losses  primarily in our florida  ohio and kentucky markets 
this increase in reported losses was the result of an over increase in the average severity of claims in these markets 
the prior year development of million was also unusually large because the florida and ohio markets were relatively new to us  making our initial reserve estimates difficult to predict 
these higher than expected reported losses continued into  but at a much lower level than in as a result  we also increased prior year reserves in by approximately million

these actions had the effect of decreasing workers compensation direct premiums written for the three months ended december   to million from million for the same period of management expects the trend of decreasing direct premiums written to continue into the near future as it implements its business plans to replace the kentucky and construction policy premiums as discussed below 
in june  the company filled several executive and management positions in its workers compensation segment to improve the overall performance of this segment  reduce risk exposures and improve profitability 
we expect to see growth in our worker s compensation segment  but not until the second half of  as management is still implementing its business plans for this segment

the reserve adjustments included a total of approximately million increase on prior accident years  primarily the and years 
in addition  the current accident year loss estimates were increased to approximately million to reflect our revised assumptions regarding loss development patterns 
the adjustments were made primarily as a result of losses in our ohio  florida and kentucky medical professional liability markets
