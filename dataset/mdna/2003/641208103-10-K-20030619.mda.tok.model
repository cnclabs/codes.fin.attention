fiscal total revenue decreased from million in fiscal  due mostly to a decrease in service revenue  which was substantially reduced by the sale of our federal services business in that year  as well as slightly reduced product revenue 
product revenue increased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal fiscal product revenue decreased from million in fiscal product revenue is generated primarily from our circuit switched product line  promina  which accounts for the majority of our worldwide product sales 
product revenue increased in fiscal primarily due to the strength of our promina sales to government agencies  both domestically and internationally 
in addition  product sales of our new broadband products scream and shoutip  contributed to the product revenue increase in fiscal but remain less than of total revenues 
product revenue declined in primarily as a result of a general decline in the overall market for circuit switched products 
product revenue was also impacted in by the end of life for our sonet transmission manager stm  product line  which accounted for million in revenue in fiscal and no revenue in fiscal the decrease was partially offset by revenue growth in our federal business  fueled by increased government defense spending and increased security initiatives after the events of september  product revenue for the federal government sales channel  which includes sales to the us government and government contractors  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was an increase of compared to million in fiscal the revenue growth for the federal government sales channel is partially a result of our screamlink program 
in fiscal  we announced our screamlink program that combines the promina platform and scream under a single management architecture and allows our customers who use our narrowband product to migrate to a broadband atm ip network 
the screamlink strategy is partially responsible for the renewed demand in our promina product line and some of the initial interest in our new scream product line from our traditional government customers 
product revenue for the north america other than government sales channel was million in fiscal representing a decrease of compared to million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of from million in fiscal product revenue for the asia pacific latin america sales channel was million in fiscal  representing a decrease of compared to million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of from million in fiscal product revenue for the european sales channel was million in fiscal  representing an increase of compared to million in fiscal  which represented a decrease of compared to the million in fiscal service and other revenue decreased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  as the result of enterprise customers lowering service levels to reduce costs 
fiscal service and other revenue decreased compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to the sale of our federal services business fsb to caci international inc caci in the third quarter of fiscal the fsb revenue in fiscal   and was million  million and million  respectively 
we have developed service creation solutions that expand our service offerings for our newer product lines  scream and shoutip  which may offset part of the decline in service and other revenue experienced in fiscal and in addition  we have recently announced the end of life for service on our idnx product line  and to the extent customers make network upgrades to our current products  we would expect a level of related service revenue 
despite incremental service and other revenue from the new product offerings and the network upgrades  we believe service and other revenue will remain relatively flat or decrease in fiscal  compared to fiscal  as a result of a decline in the installed base of promina equipment 
gross margin total gross margin  comprised of product and service margin  increased as a percentage of total revenue to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in total gross margin in fiscal is primarily the result of the following higher product margins 
product gross margins as a percentage of product revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in product gross margins resulted from the higher product revenue and lower manufacturing variances compared to fiscal manufacturing variances were reduced  primarily by lower charges for excess and obsolete inventory  which was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million charge in fiscal resulted primarily from the obsolescence of a first generation printed circuit assembly used in the shoutip product line 
a mix of total revenue that included a lower percentage of service and other revenue and a higher percentage of product revenue 
service and other revenue gross margins are lower than product revenue gross margins 
the percentage of service revenue to total revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in total gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily the result of the following lower product revenue gross margins 
product gross margin decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal in fiscal  we incurred charges of million related to the write off of excess and obsolete inventory 
in fiscal  a charge of million was taken in connection with the end of life and subsequent obsolescence of the stm and the router accelerator product lines 
additionally  in fiscal and  product margins were impacted by unfavorable manufacturing variances resulting from lower revenues 
lower service and other revenue gross margin 
services and other revenue gross margin decreased to of revenue in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in service and other revenue gross margin in fiscal primarily resulted from lower services contract revenues resulting from the sale of our federal service business fsb to caci in the third quarter of fiscal a significant portion of service costs are fixed  and thus margins will continue to be low while service revenue remains low 
gross margins may be adversely affected in the future by increases in material or labor costs  excess inventory  obsolescence charges  changes in shipment volume  loss of cost savings  increased price competition  geographic mix and changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products and services sold 
if product or related warranty costs associated with our products are greater than we have previously experienced  gross margin would also be adversely affected 
operating expenses total operating expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue is partly due to tightly managed expenses  but in fiscal is also due to higher total revenue over fiscal and the completion of amortization of certain assets in fiscal the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal over fiscal is due to the sharp reduction in revenue in fiscal  as well as restructuring expense in fiscal compared to a credit in fiscal in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we completed two separate restructurings that each included a reduction in our workforce 
these reductions contributed to lower operating expenses in fiscal and in addition  each quarter of fiscal included small restructurings of either reductions in our workforce or downsizing of field offices 
the restructure expense in fiscal was a charge of million compared to million in fiscal and a credit of million in fiscal the credit in fiscal resulted from lower costs than initially estimated related to the closure of field offices 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal decreased  to million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal sales and marketing spending as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal decreased to compared to in fiscal and decreased from in fiscal the decrease in fiscal spending compared to resulted primarily from the following o a reduction of  in depreciation and amortization  o a reduction of  in advertising expense  o a reduction of  in facility and information systems expenses  o a reduction of  in third party service costs for international sales offices  o a decrease in recruiting expense of  and o a decrease in communications costs of  these decreases were offset in part by an increase in salary and related costs of million  primarily related to sales commissions 
the decrease in fiscal spending  compared to  resulted from a decrease in salary and related costs of million  a decrease in travel expenses of  a decrease in depreciation costs of million  and a decrease of million in lower sales and marketing related costs consistent with decreased revenue 
research and development expenses in fiscal decreased million to million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal research and development spending as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in fiscal spending  compared to  resulted from a reduction of million in salary related expenses  a decrease of million in depreciation and amortization costs and a reduction of million in engineering related materials expenses 
in fiscal  and  we focused research and development resources on the development and release of our broadband and ip telephony product offerings 
the decrease in fiscal spending  compared to resulted from a reduction of million in salary related expenses  a decrease of million in depreciation costs and a reduction of million in engineering related materials expenses 
in fiscal  we expect that research and development expenses will remain flat or increase slightly as we balance cost control with the development and introduction of enhancements to our new products 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased million to million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal general and administrative spending as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and increased from in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative spending in fiscal compared to was the result of reduction of  in salary related expenses  a decrease in recruiting and relocation expense of  and a decrease in facility and information systems expenses of  the decrease in general and administrative spending in fiscal compared to  was the result of decreased salary related expenses of million  offset by an increase of  in information technology related expenses 
we expect general and administrative spending to remain relatively flat or decline slightly due to continued focus on cost control 
the restructuring charge of million recorded during fiscal consisted of  for employee separation costs   for lease termination costs   for office closure costs  and  for other charges 
the remaining liability for restructuring charges is  at march  the restructuring charge of million recorded during fiscal consisted of million for employee separation costs and  for other charges 
the remaining liability for restructuring charges was  at march  components of accrued restructuring charges  which are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet  and changes in accrued amounts related to this restructuring program during the fiscal years ended march   march  and as of march  were as follows in thousands employee office other separation lease closure restructuring costs write off costs costs total balance at march provision   payments   balance at march provision  payments  balance at march we believe that all costs associated with our plan of business reorganization will be paid no later than the end of fiscal as a result of the adoption of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  goodwill and other intangible assets were written off 
amortization of goodwill ceased  and therefore there was no amortization of goodwill in fiscal amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal and was million in each year 
the amortization expense in fiscal and fiscal was a result of two acquisitions  convergence equipment company  which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal  and flowwise networks  inc  which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment under certain circumstances 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess  and written down when impaired  rather than being amortized as previous standards required 
we completed our implementation test  which determined that goodwill was impaired  resulting in a charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal this charge is presented as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  relating to goodwill 
non operating items interest income  primarily related to cash and short term investments  decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in interest income is primarily the result of declining yields as well as lower cash balances of our investment portfolio in fiscal and compared to fiscal although cash balances may increase in fiscal  we expect interest income to decline as a result of declining yields from our investment portfolio 
interest expense increased  to million in fiscal  compared to million in both fiscal and fiscal interest expense is primarily attributable to the convertible subordinated debentures 
interest expense for the debentures remained constant in fiscal   and at million in each year 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal resulted from debt obligations assumed by net 
com as part of the building repair for our former fremont  california campus 
other income in fiscal decreased million to million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal other income in fiscal included a gain of million from insurance proceeds received for construction costs associated with our new fremont campus and a gain of million from the caci agreement for the divestiture of our fsb 
other income in fiscal included a gain of million from insurance proceeds associated with our new fremont campus and a gain of million from the sale of our fsb 
other income in fiscal included a gain of million from the sale of our fsb 
we expect further gains in fiscal and fiscal of million each year  related to the caci agreement for the divestiture of our fsb 
we received tax benefits of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal each year  we evaluate the adequacy of our tax liability reserves taking into account the statute of limitations on previously filed tax returns as well as our expected net losses 
the result of this reevaluation was to reduce the amount of reserves and to record a tax benefit in each of the past three fiscal years 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of march  in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt   interest on long term debt      operating leases      total contractual obligations      significant accounting policy judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and judgments  which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring charges  contingencies  such as litigation  and contract terms that have multiple elements and other complexities typical in the telecommunications equipment industry 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  generally upon shipment  when all four of the following criteria are met we have a contract with our customer  when delivery has occurred and risk of loss passes to the customer  when our price is fixed or determinable  and when collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
for transactions where we have not yet obtained customer acceptance  revenue is generally deferred until the terms of acceptance are satisfied 
revenue for installation or other services is recognized upon completion of the service 
maintenance contracts are sold separately from the products and revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the contracts 
a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product returns 
if the actual future returns differ from historical levels  our revenue could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 
inventory provisions inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there is a significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may be required to make adjustments to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or market  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
warranty accruals we generally warrant hardware product sales for twelve months and software for three months 
we accrue warranty expense based on historical expense trends calculated as a percentage of new product sales 
actual expenses are charged against the accrual in the period they are incurred 
on a quarterly basis  the warranty accrual is analyzed for adequacy based on actual trends and subsequent adjustments are made to the liability balance 
components of the warranty accrual  which are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet  during fiscal were as follows in thousands balance at charges to charges to other balance beginning of cost of warranty adjustments end of period goods sold accrual the period year ended march adjustment resulted from a change in warranty cost estimates primarily from lower hourly costs of labor to repair products and frequency of warranty claims 
stock based compensation we account for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations 
accordingly  no charges were taken in fiscal years   and as all stock options were granted at market price 
deferred taxes we have incurred tax losses in the last four fiscal years and  at march   we have an estimated million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state operating loss carryforwards available to reduce tax payments in future periods 
we have provided a full valuation allowance against our tax assets  given the uncertainty as to their realization 
in future years  these benefits are available to reduce or eliminate taxes on future taxable income 
current federal and state tax laws include provisions that could limit the annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards in the event of certain defined changes in stock ownership 
our issuances of common and preferred stock may have resulted in such a change 
accordingly  the annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards may be reduced by these provisions 
management has not yet determined the extent of the limitation  and this limitation may result in the loss of carryforward benefits due to their expiration 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  restricted cash of million and short term investments of million for a total of million as compared to million at the end of fiscal and million at the end of fiscal in fiscal  the days sales outstanding dso decreased days to days from days at the end of fiscal the lower dso resulted in a decrease in accounts receivable of million to million at the end of fiscal compared to million at the end of fiscal the lower accounts receivable combined with the million payment received from caci and the insurance proceeds of million offset our net operating losses  thus keeping cash and investment balances relatively flat year over year 
the fiscal reduction was primarily the result of cash used to fund operations  as well as million used to build our new fremont campus 
net cash used in operations was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  cash used in operations resulted primarily from a net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million 
net cash provided by operations included a reduction in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in inventory of  and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million 
net non cash operating activity included the adjustment for depreciation and amortization of million  a gain recognized from proceeds relating to the sale of our fsb of million  a gain recognized of million from the insurance settlement relating to our new fremont campus  cash proceeds from the insurance settlement of million and the cumulative change in accounting principle for goodwill impairment of million 
in fiscal  cash used in operations resulted primarily from a net loss of million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million 
net cash provided by operations in fiscal  resulted primarily from a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in inventory of million  and a decrease in prepaid assets of million 
net non cash operating activity in fiscal  included the adjustments for depreciation and amortization of million  a gain recognized from proceeds relating to the sale of our fsb of million  a gain recognized of million from the insurance settlement relating to our new fremont campus  and cash proceeds from the insurance settlement of million 
net cash provided by investment activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash provided by investment activities was primarily from maturing temporary investments  net of new purchases  of million  million received from the sale of our fsb and a decrease in restricted cash of million  offset by million of cash used for the purchases of fixed assets  net of retirements 
net cash provided by investment activities in fiscal consisted primarily of the proceeds from maturing temporary cash investments  net of new purchases  of million  and million received from the sale of our fsb  offset by million of cash used for the purchases of fixed assets  most of which were leasehold improvements on our new fremont campus  and an increase in restricted cash of million used primarily to secure a line of credit required by the lease provisions 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was million from the sale of common stock  offset by the use of  in cash for the payment of capital leases 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was million from the sale of common stock  offset by the use of  in cash for the payment of capital leases 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was million from the sale of common stock  which was partially offset by the use of million in cash for the repurchase of common stock and  in cash for the payment of capital lease 
we believe that our existing current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations  purchases of capital equipment and research and development programs currently planned at least through the next months 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
sfas requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
sfas is effective for interim periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect of sfas on our balance sheet  results of operations and cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends sfas for certain decisions made by the fasb derivatives implementation group 
in particular  sfas clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative  clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component  amends the definition of an underlying to conform it to language used in fasb interpretation no 
fin  and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after june  in addition  most provisions of sfas no 
are to be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the effect of this statement on our balance sheet  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas as of march  we have not yet determined the effect that the transition provisions of sfas would have on our operating results or financial position  if any 
in november  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it is issued 
we adopted the disclosure requirement of fin we are currently determining what effect if any  the other provisions of fin will have on our operating results or financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on our historical consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
while sfas supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  it retains many of the fundamental provisions of sfas sfas also supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions of apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
however  it retains the requirement in apb to report separately discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
we adopted sfas on march the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
business environment and risk factors our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described below 
although we have tried to identify the material risks to our business  this is not an all inclusive list 
there may be additional risks that have not yet been identified and risks that are not material now but could become material 
any one of these risks could hurt our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have incurred net losses in the past and may continue to incur losses in the future 
for each of the past five fiscal years  we have incurred net losses 
although the company has reduced operating expenses over the past few years  we will need revenues to continue to grow in order to achieve profitability 
our narrowband product line  promina  currently provides the bulk of our revenue  but we expect revenue from that product line to decline over the next few years 
our newer broadband and ip telephony product lines  scream and shoutip  have not yet achieved market acceptance or broad commercial sales  and we are incurring substantial product development and marketing expenses for those product lines 
accordingly  we will not likely be profitable unless our newer product lines achieve commercial success that outpaces the anticipated decline of our promina product line 
in addition  we must contain our operating expenses  many of which are fixed in the short term making it difficult to reduce expenses rapidly in response to shortfalls in revenue 
our operating results may continue to fluctuate 
our operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations may result from a number of factors  including o the volume and timing of orders from and shipments to our customers  o the length and variability of the sales cycle of our products  o the timing of and our ability to obtain new customer contracts  o the timing of new products and services  o the mix of sales among products and services  o the timing and level of prototype expenses  o the availability of products and services  o the overall capital expenditures of our customers  o the market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and services or variations in the mix of products and services we sell  o the availability and cost of key components  o the timing of revenue recognition deferrals  o the adoption of new accounting standards  such as the potential requirement to record expenses for employee stock option grants  o changes to revenue recognition rules or changing interpretations of such rules as they apply to our sales  o the obsolescence of inventories  o the timing and size of federal government budget approvals  and o general economic conditions as well as those specific to the telecommunications  internet and related industries 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
any shortfall in revenue may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
investors should not rely on our results or growth for one quarter as any indication of our future performance 
our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past  will likely continue to fluctuate in the future and may decline 
fluctuations or a decline in our stock price may occur regardless of our performance 
among the factors that could affect our stock price  in addition to our performance  are o variations between our operating results and the published expectations of securities analysts  changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business  o announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  new products or services  acquisitions  or other significant transactions  o our sale of common stock or other securities in the future  o the inclusion or exclusion of our stock in various indices or investment categories  especially as compared to the investment profiles of our stockholders at a given time  o changes in economic and capital market conditions  o changes in business regulatory conditions  and o the trading volume of our common stock 
we are dependent on revenue from the promina product line 
currently  we derive the majority of our product revenue from our promina product line  a circuit based narrowband technology 
the market for our promina product is expected to decline as networks are expected to increasingly employ packet based broadband technology 
this technology migration has already resulted in a significant drop in sales of our promina products in the commercial markets over the last three years 
if this decline extends into our government markets in a similar fashion before we gain traction on our newer packet based broadband product lines  our revenue will decrease  and our business and results of operations will suffer 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from sales to governmental agencies 
a significant portion of our total revenue from product sales comes from contracts with governmental agencies  most of which do not include long term purchase commitments 
historically  the government has been slower to adopt new technology  such as packet based technology  which has had the effect of extending the product life of our promina product 
however  the government has purchased and is evaluating some of our new products for broader deployment 
if the government accelerated adoption of new technology  and replaced the promina product line in their networks with products other than ours  our product revenue would decline sharply 
we anticipate that our past experience will result in future contracts with the federal government  however  we face significant competition in this endeavor 
if we fail in renewing a significant number of federal government contracts or if sales to the federal government decline sharply  our revenue may not increase to profitable levels 
continued declines in purchases by our commercial customers and the overall decline of product sales in the service provider market could negatively affect our operations and financial results 
over the last three years  the financial health of many of our commercial customers  particularly telecommunications service providers  has deteriorated  resulting in a decreased demand for our products 
in addition  the timing and volume of purchases by service providers can be unpredictable due to their need to generate new revenue with sharply reduced capital budgets while reducing operating expenses 
further  our ability to recognize revenue on sales to these customers will depend on our meeting various acceptance criteria imposed on the company in connection with these products by our early adopter customers  and on the relative financial condition of these customers and whether receivables balances from them are deemed to be collectible 
also  the selling cycle of our scream and shoutip product lines could be extended if our service provider customers continue to reduce their capital budgets 
declines in revenue as a result of any of these factors could cause a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to develop new products and product enhancements that will achieve market acceptance 
our operating results will depend on the successful design  development  testing  introduction  marketing  and broad commercial distribution of our newer packet based products  the scream and shoutip product lines 
the success of these and other new products is dependent on several factors  including proper product definition  competitive pricing  timely completion and introduction to the market  differentiation from competitors products  and broad market acceptance 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks 
our scream product line is targeted at long established incumbent carriers  such as bellsouth  sbc communications  sprint  verizon  british telecom and france telecom  who typically have stringent product requirements and who are reluctant to purchase products from vendors lacking a large market capitalization 
our shoutip product line is largely targeted at start up telecommunications companies who demand highly competitive pricing 
we may not successfully identify new product opportunities  develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner  or achieve market acceptance of our products 
products and technologies developed by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or non competitive  which in turn could adversely affect our ability to achieve profitability 
the success of our scream product line depends largely on it being chosen by service providers as a platform for the delivery of new services 
since the second quarter of our fiscal year  we have spent the majority of our research and development and marketing resources to position ourselves  and our scream family of products  as the next generation of telecommunications equipment that will enable carriers to optimize the delivery of differentiated services 
the future success of the scream product line will depend in large measure on service providers choosing to invest in products  such as scream  that can be used to deliver new services such as quality of service guarantees  class of service subscriptions  or bandwidth on demand  to increase their revenue and lower their operating expenses 
if service providers do not meaningfully invest in such new technologies  or do not choose the scream product line for such investment  our revenues from scream will be negatively affected  which will in turn have a negative effect on our business and operating results 
we need partnerships to accelerate the acceptance of our new products by service providers 
building relationships with partners  such as software application partners  system integrators  oems or resellers can accelerate the sales of new products 
the importance of the software application partners is that they provide functions  such as billing  mediation  provisioning and configuration that are needed to create a total solution for our customers 
we need product oem or resale partners to supplement and enhance our sales force both in the united states and overseas 
service providers rely on systems integrators to support new equipment or services into their network 
these integrators are important in the large incumbent carrier networks and could facilitate our entry into those networks 
while we have begun the process of identifying and signing software application  system integrator and oem or resale partners  more partners may be necessary in all these areas for us to be successful 
we may need to pursue strategic partnerships with vendors who have broader technology or product offerings in order to compete with the end to end solution providers  as well as to bolster our co marketing efforts 
failure to sign up these new strategic partners could affect our ability to grow overall revenue 
gross margins could decline over future periods 
due to increases in competition  material and labor costs  subcontractor costs  change in absorption rate and changes in the mix of products we sell  our gross margins could decline in future quarters 
our newer product lines  scream and shoutip  currently have lower gross margins than our promina product line 
these lower gross margins are a result of higher discounts awarded to early adopter customers and higher component costs due to low purchase volumes of these components 
a decline in our gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
factors beyond our control could affect our ability to sell into international markets 
we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states and depend on non us operations of our subsidiaries and distribution partners 
in addition  we also maintain a satellite research and development facility in ottawa  province of ontario  canada and  on a case by case basis  we outsource research and development activities to third parties here in the us and abroad 
as a general rule  international sales tend to have risks that are difficult to foresee and plan for  including political and economic stability  regulatory changes  currency exchange rates  changes in tax rates and structures  and collection of accounts receivable 
further  our international markets are served primarily by non exclusive resellers who themselves may be severely affected by economic or market changes within a particular country or region 
our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors that could affect these activities  including  among others  the outbreak of infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 
unforeseen or unpredictable changes in international markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the divestiture of our federal services business has reduced our ability to control the quality of service provided to our federal government customers 
on december   we closed the sale of our federal service business to caci  who subsequently provides maintenance and other services to our federal government customers 
we continue to sell net 
com products directly to the federal government and we rely on caci to perform staging and integration services for them 
additionally  we have a strategic alliance with caci to jointly market each other s products and services 
as a result of these arrangements  we are dependent on caci to provide the level of service to which our customers have become accustomed 
if caci experiences difficulties in providing those services  or for any other reason leaves our mutual customers unsatisfied  it could adversely affect purchasing decisions for our products and cause our federal government customers to seek products from other vendors 
the market for our products is highly competitive and many of our competitors have greater resources than us 
the market for telecommunication equipment is highly competitive  dynamic and characterized by rapid changes to and the convergence of technologies  and a worldwide migration from existing circuit technology to the new packet based technologies 
we compete directly internationally and domestically with many different companies  some of which are large  established suppliers of end to end solutions  such as alcatel  cisco  lucent  nortel  juniper and siemens 
in addition  there are a number of other smaller companies that are targeting the same market  including cosine  nuera  copper mountain  advanced fiber communications  redback  and others 
some of our larger competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we have and offer a wider range of networking products than we offer 
they are often able to devote greater resources to the development  marketing and sale of their products and to use their equity or significant cash reserves to acquire other companies with technology and or products that compete directly with ours 
they often can compete favorably on price because their large product selection allows them to bundle multiple solutions together without significantly impacting their overall product margins 
the smaller companies have more ability than net 
com to focus their resources on a particular product development unencumbered by the requirements to support an existing product line 
as a result of the flexibility of their market strategies  our competitors may be able to obtain strategic advantages that may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the networking equipment market has seen the constant introduction of new technologies that has reduced the value of older technology solutions 
this has created pricing pressure on older products while increasing the performance expectations of newer networking equipment 
moreover  broadband technology standards are constantly evolving and alternative technologies or technologies with greater capability are constantly introduced and sought by our customers 
it is possible that the introduction of other technologies will either supplant our current technologies and technologies we have in development or will require us to significantly lower our prices in order to remain competitive 
to remain competitive  we must continue to evolve our scream and shoutip product lines to meet the ever changing technology needs of the networking market while ensuring that they can be sold at a competitive price 
we also must enhance our promina product line to provide needed features that increase their overall value for the customer while keeping the price competitive 
due to the competitive nature of the market and the relative age of our promina product offerings as well as the competitive pressure being exerted on our scream and shoutip technologies  we may not be able to maintain prices for them at levels that will sustain profitability 
if we are unable to sign competitive resale partners  our future product and service revenue will be adversely affected 
our international sales are made almost entirely through indirect channels that include distributors and resellers worldwide  and our business strategy includes leveraging resale partners in the united states as well 
our reseller agreements do not have minimum purchase requirements that they must meet 
while we require them to use their best efforts to resell our products  because our product line is small  our distributors and resellers often also resell product lines from other companies  including our competitors 
because of the size of some of these competitors and their strong market position relative to net 
com  it is often difficult for us to find a distributor or reseller who is willing and contractually able to resell our products 
if we cannot develop relationships with distributors and resellers that can effectively market and sell our products and services  we may not be able to meet our forecasted revenue in future quarters 
our products have long sales cycles  making it difficult to predict when a customer will place an order and when to forecast revenue from the related sale 
our products are very complex and represent a significant capital expenditure to our customers 
the purchase of our products can have a significant impact on how a customer designs its network and provides services either within its own organization or to an external customer 
consequently  our customers often engage in extensive testing and evaluation of products before purchase 
there are also numerous financial and budget considerations and approvals that the customer often must obtain before it will issue a purchase order 
as a result  the length of our sales cycle can be quite long  extending beyond twelve months in some cases 
in addition  our customers  including resellers  often have the contractual right to delay scheduled order delivery dates with minimal penalties and to cancel orders within specified time frames without penalty  which makes it difficult to predict whether or not an order may actually ship 
we often must incur substantial sales and marketing expense to ensure a purchase order is placed 
if the order is not placed in the quarter forecasted  our sales may not meet forecast and revenue may be insufficient to meet expenses 
because it is difficult for us to accurately forecast sales  particularly within a given time frame  we face a risk of carrying too much or too little inventory 
typically  the majority of our revenue in each quarter has resulted from orders received and shipped in that quarter 
while we do not believe that backlog is necessarily indicative of future revenue levels  our customers ordering patterns and the possible absence of backlogged orders create a significant risk that we could carry too much or too little inventory if orders do not match forecasts 
rather than base forecasts on orders received  we have been forced to schedule production and commit to certain expenses based more upon forecasts of future sales  which are difficult to predict in the telecommunications industry 
furthermore  if large orders do not close when forecasted or if near term demand weakens for the products we have available to ship  our operating results for that quarter or subsequent quarters would be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to retain existing employees and attract  recruit and retain key personnel  then we may not be able to successfully manage our business 
our success continues to be dependent on our being able to attract and retain highly skilled engineers  managers and other key employees 
despite the economic slowdown  we must continue to compete for the most qualified personnel for new positions and to replace departing employees 
any restrictions on our ability to use stock options as a key component of employee compensation  such as changes in accounting treatment  stockholder actions  or changes in corporate regulations  could severely impair our ability to recruit and retain personnel 
if we are not able to continue to attract  recruit and retain key personnel  particularly in engineering  sales and marketing positions  we may be unable to meet important company objectives such as product delivery deadlines and sales targets 
we rely on a number of sole source suppliers for our component parts and third party products which could affect our ability to ship our products in a timely manner 
we purchase key components from single source suppliers  in particular  our back planes  integrated circuits  and power supplies 
if we or our sole source suppliers fail to obtain components in sufficient quantities when required  delivery of our products could be delayed resulting in decreased revenues 
in addition  if one of these suppliers were no longer able to supply a required component  we may have to significantly reengineer the affected product 
further  variability in demand and cyclical shortages of capacity in the semiconductor industry have caused lead times for ordering parts to increase from time to time 
if we encounter shortages or delays in receiving ordered components or if we are not able to accurately forecast our ordering requirements  we may be unable to ship ordered products in a timely manner 
we single source our manufacturing process  a failure or delay by that vendor could affect our ability to ship our products timely 
we currently subcontract some testing and all product manufacturing to solectron 
final test and assembly is generally performed at our fremont  california facility 
while subcontracting creates substantial cost efficiencies in the manufacturing process  it also exposes us to delays in product shipments should solectron be unable to perform under our contract 
pursuant to our contract with solectron  we have agreed to compensate solectron in the event of a termination or a cancellation of orders  discontinuance of product or excess material created by an engineering change 
also  should solectron in some future period decide not to renew our contract with them  it would be difficult for us to quickly transfer our manufacturing requirements from solectron to another vendor  likely causing substantial delays in customer product shipments and impacting revenue and our results of operations 
we plan in the near term to transition some of our product manufacturing to another vendor  with contract terms that will likely involve some of the same provisions for compensation of the vendor as we have with solectron 
although this transition will diversify some of the outsourcing risk  the transition itself  and the lack of experience with the new vendor  could cause delays in customer product shipments or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations 
our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business 
our future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology 
although we attempt to establish and maintain rights in proprietary technology and products through patents  copyrights  and trade secrets laws  we cannot predict whether such protection will be adequate  or whether our competitors can develop similar technology independently without violating our proprietary rights 
as competition in the communications equipment industry increases and the functionality of the products in this industry further overlap  we believe that companies in the communications equipment industry may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
we have received and may continue to receive notice from third parties  including some of our competitors  claiming that we are infringing their patents or their other proprietary rights 
we cannot predict whether we will prevail in any litigation over third party claims  or that we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents on commercially reasonable terms 
any of these claims  whether with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  divert our management s time  attention and resources  delay our product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in addition  a third party may not be willing to enter into a royalty or licensing agreement on acceptable terms  if at all 
if a claim of product infringement against us is successful and we fail to obtain a license or develop or license non infringing technology  we may be unable to market the affected product 
we need to continue to license products from third parties 
for our promina  scream and shoutip products  we license some of our technology from third parties 
these licenses are generally limited in duration or by the volume of shipments of the licensed technology 
in addition  some of these licenses contain limitations on distribution of the licensed technology or provide for expiration upon certain events  such as a change in control of the company 
if the relevant licensing agreement expires or is terminated without our being able to renew that license on commercially reasonable terms  or if we cannot obtain a license for our products or enhancements on our existing products we may be unable to market the affected product 
we face risks associated with changes in telecommunications regulations and tariffs  including regulation of the internet 
changes in domestic and international telecommunications requirements could affect the sales of our products 
in the united states  our products must comply with various federal communication commission fcc requirements and regulations 
in countries outside of the united states  our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities 
changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could impact our ability to market the affected product 
the demand for our broadband products could also be affected by rulings of the fcc regarding services offered by service providers to their customers  such as differentiated broadband services 
if rulings or regulations of the fcc diminish the attractiveness of offering such services  then service providers would likely have less need for our products 
in addition  there are currently few laws or regulations that govern access or commerce on the internet 
if individual countries  or groups of countries  acting in concert  began to impose regulations or standards on internet access or commerce including ip telephony  our ability to sell our new scream and shoutip products or other new products would be adversely impacted if the regulations or standards resulted in decreased demand or increased costs for our products 
in north america  the former regional bell operating companies rbocs recommend that telcordia technologies  inc certify telecommunications equipment under their operations systems modifications for the integration of network elements osmine program in order to ensure interoperability with other network elements and operational support systems 
we have initiated the process for our product lines to become osmine certified  but this is a very expensive and lengthy process 
any delays or problems with attaining this certification could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
in fiscal  we commenced using foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant accounts receivable and intercompany account balances denominated in foreign currencies 
although we have established foreign exchange contracts for non dollar denominated sales and operating expenses in the united kingdom  france  germany and japan  exposures remain for non dollar denominated operating expenses in latin america  canada  and asia 
we will continue to monitor our exposure and may hedge against these or any other emerging market currencies as necessary 
market value gains and losses on hedge contracts are substantially offset by fluctuations in the underlying balances being hedged 
the location of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquake and floods 
our corporate headquarters  including most of our research and development operations and our manufacturing facilities  are located in the silicon valley area of northern california  a region known for seismic activity 
these facilities are located near the san francisco bay where the water table is quite close to the surface and where tenants have experienced water intrusion problems in the facilities nearby 
in particular  unknown defects in the construction of our new facilities combined with the proximity to water may result in future water infiltration problems for net 
com 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake or flood  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosure involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we began using foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant accounts receivable and intercompany account balances denominated in foreign currencies 
market value gains and losses on these hedged contracts are substantially offset by fluctuations in the underlying balances being hedged 
the net financial impact of foreign exchange gains and losses has not been material 
as a result  a increase or decrease in the foreign currency rates would not have a significant effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our policy is to not use hedges or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
a portion of our investment portfolio is composed of income securities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease of from levels at march  and march  indicated the fair value of the portfolio would change by an immaterial amount 
at march   the fair value of the short term investments was million compared to million at march  the fair market value of our convertible subordinated debentures is sensitive to changes in interest rates and to the prices of our common stock into which it can be converted as well as our financial stability 
the yield to maturity on the debentures is fixed  therefore the interest expense on the debt does not fluctuate with interest rates 
at march   the fair value of the trading debt securities was approximately million
