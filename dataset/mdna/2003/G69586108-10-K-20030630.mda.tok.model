the remaining accrual was reversed during the year ended march  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we are a leading supplier of precision engineered packaging products for the storage  transportation and automated handling of semiconductor devices and other electronic components 
our products are designed to interface with automated handling equipment used in the production and testing of semiconductor and electronic products 
we produce principally matrix and disk drive trays  carrier tapes  reels  and shipping tubes 
we also produce leadframe boxes and interleaves used in the storage and transportation of leadframes 
in addition  we collect and sell recycled matrix trays using the name semicycle 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make a variety of estimates that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
the following accounting policies are currently considered most critical to the preparation of our financial statements 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is recognized when product has been shipped and title to the product has transferred to the customer 
title of the product may transfer to the end customer or distributor when shipped or when received by the customer based on a specific agreement 
we evaluate the provision for estimated returns monthly  based on historical sales and returns 
to date we have not experienced significant returns 
any increase in the level of returns could have a material and adverse effect on our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts is made against accounts receivable to the extent they are considered to be doubtful 
accounts receivable in the balance sheet are stated net of such provision 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due 
a provision is also made based on the aging of the receivables 
if circumstances change  such as the incurrence of higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change occurs regarding a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory valuation we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
at each balance sheet date  inventory on hand in excess of one year s demand or usage or those that were produced more than twelve months ago  are written down to zero 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we test such assets for a potential impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the estimated future cash flows  undiscounted  are less than the asset s carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
asset to be disposed of by sale asset to be disposed of by sale represents the factory under construction in shenzhen  the prc  together with the land use right on which the building is built and is stated at fair value less cost to sell as of the balance sheet date in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
fair value was calculated on the basis of a professional valuation report on the property provided by an independent appraiser 
deferred taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax bases of assets and liabilities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is more unlikely than likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
any change in the future recoverability of the deferred tax assets could significantly affect the results of our operations or cash flows 
overview the following information is based on  and should be read with  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
our consolidated net sales decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but increased to million in fiscal  reflecting primarily the significant slow down of the semiconductor industry in fiscal and the gradual recovery in fiscal our consolidated net income decreased from million in fiscal to a net loss of million in fiscal  reflecting significant price and margin erosion mainly on ic shipping trays and carrier tapes under a tough economic climate  and the effect of fixed costs when business volume decreased by over in all sections of the business in fiscal our consolidated net loss increased to million in fiscal primarily due to the asset impairment charge of million 
in anticipation of increased revenues and production volumes  we had expanded significantly our production capacity and had substantially completed construction of a second  larger production facility in shenzhen  the prc

savings in salary and rental expense were achieved as a result of our downsizing efforts in reducing headcount and subleasing of surplus office space

income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased by  or million  to  in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to the operating loss incurred in fiscal net loss income 
net income of million in fiscal was turned into a net loss of million in fiscal  reflecting all the above factors 
liquidity and capital resources we historically met a significant portion of our cash requirements from cash flow from operations  therefore a decrease in demand for the company s products would reduce the availability of funds 
our primary uses of cash have been to fund capital expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities and operations and working capital requirements 
we intend to continue to retain our earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business operations and do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
as of march   cash and cash equivalents were million  a decrease of million as compared to cash and cash equivalents of million as of march  our net cash used in operating activities was  in fiscal  compared to a net cash provision of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily caused by the purchase of tax reserve certificates totaling million during fiscal as a condition stipulated by the hong kong tax authorities while we pursue our offshore claim 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily caused by the operating loss incurred during fiscal our net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of capital expenditures of million  million and million for the acquisition of new equipment in our current facility and  nil  nil and  for the construction of an additional facility in shenzhen  the prc during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the reduction in capital expenditure in the past two years reflected capacity freeze due to the slow down of the semiconductor industry 
as of march   we had commitments for capital expenditures of  the actual amounts of capital expenditures may vary substantially from those budgeted or estimated for a variety of reasons  including changes in market conditions  unavailability or changes in scheduled delivery of specific equipment  changes in interest rates and other factors 
in addition  we plan to continue to expand capacity in future periods from cash on hand  including cash flow from operations and new bank borrowings as required 
we lease office and warehouse facilities under various leases that expire through total future minimum commitments under these leases amount to approximately million 
as of march   we had no outstanding indebtedness 
for more information  see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
according to customs rules in the prc  it is possible that we may be subject to classification by the chinese customs authorities in a manner that would require us to supply a substantial bond against customs duties that we would have to pay if we were importing material for ultimate sale in the prc 
if the customs authorities of the prc require us to post a bond in connection with our exemption status from prc duties on imported raw materials for export sales  and exported products  we will experience a substantial drain of our liquid resources 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal  compared to a cash usage of million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was primarily used to repurchase shares of our common stock and trends in fiscal in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase  at management s discretion  of up to million worth of our common stock at prices not to exceed of our net asset value per share 
common stock repurchased was cancelled immediately 
during the years ended march  and  we repurchased  and  shares of common stock  respectively  at an average cost of and respectively per share 
in addition  pursuant to an offer by us to purchase up to  trends  on may    trends were tendered by their holders to us and were purchased by us at each 
we purchased  shares of our stock from mr 
t 
l 
li for million on may   with the understanding that mr 
t 
l 
li would use the proceeds from the sale of these shares to fund his obligations under the settlement of the trends litigation and to pay outstanding legal fees 
the shares repurchased from mr 
t 
l 
li were immediately retired 
the peak shares were purchased from mr 
t 
l 
li at a per share price of per share  which represented a discount from the closing price of the shares on the nasdaq national market on that date 
as of march   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months 
if our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional public or private equity securities or obtain debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all  or if available  will be obtained on terms favorable to us 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
the company does not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor does it use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements such as research and development arrangements 
accordingly  the company s liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
from time to time  we may evaluate possible investments or acquisitions and may  if a suitable opportunity arises  make such an investment or acquisition 
we currently have no commitments to make any material investments or acquisitions 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of march   our future fixed commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase orders total hong kong profits tax we  through our subsidiary in hong kong  operate a manufacturing plant in the prc pursuant to a contract processing agreement entered into with a prc party 
according to the tax guidelines issued by the tax authority in situations where a hong kong company manufactures goods partly in hong kong and partly outside hong kong  the inland revenue department of hong kong ird may accept profits that relate to the manufacture of the goods outside hong kong to be offshore in nature and therefore not subject to hong kong profits tax 
the offshore claim would only be allowed by the ird by way of concession and provided that certain criteria are met to their satisfaction 
however  we believe that most of our manufacturing activities were conducted outside hong kong and therefore since fiscal  we have apportioned a substantial amount of our profits to to activities outside hong kong for tax filing purposes 
since fiscal  there has been a dispute with the ird in relation to the apportionment basis of the profit derived from manufacturing activities outside hong kong 
we have raised a number of objections to the tax assessments and are examining factors that the ird uses to ascertain the geographic nature of our activities and sources of the profits 
our tax position has therefore not been finalized since fiscal year although the dispute is on going  we have made provisions for taxation according to the apportionment basis based on practices normally acceptable by the ird in general cases 
interest associated with the tax payable for fiscal years to has also been accrued 
in the event we do not prevail on these issues  we believe that the aggregate maximum amount of our potential exposure is approximately million plus interest in the amount of million 
the total of the above two amounts has been fully accrued as of march  in connection with the above  the ird has requested that we place tax reserve certificates of million and letters of credit of  with the tax authority as of march   which could be recovered if we prevail 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this standard is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or business practices 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas sfas no 
amended sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
finally  sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
interim financial reporting to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after and for interim periods beginning december  we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not significantly impact our current disclosures 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees and indemnifications that it has issued and clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee or indemnification  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee or indemnification 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees and indemnifications issued or modified after december  and the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements ending after december  we believe that the adoption of fin has not significantly impacted our current disclosures and are currently assessing the impact of fin s initial recognition and measurement provisions on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency exchange rate fluctuations our sales are denominated primarily in us dollars while our cost of goods sold are generally incurred in us dollars  hong kong dollars and renminbi  and our operating expenses are generally denominated in renminbi  hong kong dollars  singapore dollars  new taiwanese dollars and us dollars 
in addition  a substantial portion of our capital expenditures  primarily for the purchase of equipment  has been and is expected to continue to be denominated in us dollars  renminbi and japanese yen 
consequently  a portion of our costs and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the us dollar and other currencies 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of new or additional currency controls in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
primarily in response to recent developments in the southeast asian currency markets  we from time to time engage in derivative trading activities  such as entering into forward contracts  to hedge our currency exchange exposure 
we do not utilize market risk sensitive instruments for speculative purposes 
at march   we have no outstanding foreign exchange contracts  while at march  we had foreign exchange contract of million to sell singapore dollars 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counterparties to such contracts 
however  we do not anticipate non performance because the counterparties are major financial institutions 
many of our competitors are located in countries whose currencies devalued significantly against the us dollar beginning in the second half of as a result of such devaluation  these competitors products have become less expensive in us dollar terms 
this reduction could result in our customers purchasing products from these competitors rather than from us  which would have a material and adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations 
as the hong kong dollar is officially pegged to the us dollar and the renminbi is controlled by the prc government such that it only trades within a limited range against the us dollar  unless there are significant changes in the policies of the hong kong and the prc government  fluctuations in the exchange rates of the hong kong dollar and the renminbi are not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations 
pvc compound price pvc compound  the principal material used in the manufacture of tubes  accounted for  and of our total raw material costs in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
while we believe  primarily as a result of increased production capacity by suppliers  that a severe shortage in the supply of pvc compound is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that such shortage will not occur 
any price increases would result in higher costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently maintain approximately two to three months stock of pvc compound and other raw materials used in our production processes  and increase such stock when we believe prices are favorable 
we do not  and do not intend to  enter into future contracts or use any financial instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the price of pvc compound or other raw materials used in our production processes
