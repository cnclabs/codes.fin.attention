management s discussion table of contents page business overview wgl holdings  inc primary factors affecting wgl holdings results of operations liquidity and capital resources market risk washington gas light company primary factors affecting washington gas results of operations liquidity and capital resources regulatory matters wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued business overview wgl holdings  through its subsidiaries  sells and delivers natural gas and provides a variety of energy related products and services to customers primarily in the metropolitan areas of washington  dc  maryland and virginia 
the company s core subsidiary  washington gas  is involved in the delivery and sale of natural gas that primarily is regulated by state regulatory commissions 
in response to changes in federal and state regulation  the company has taken the initiative to offer competitively priced natural gas and electricity to customers through its unregulated retail energy marketing subsidiary 
through the wholly owned unregulated subsidiaries of washington gas resources corporation washington gas resources  the company also offers energy related products and services that are closely related to its core business 
wgl holdings has three operating segments that are described below regulated utility  retail energy marketing  and heating  ventilating and air conditioning hvac products and services 
transactions not specifically identifiable in one of the above three segments are accumulated and reported in the category other activities 
regulated utility with over percent of the company s assets  washington gas delivers natural gas to retail customers in accordance with tariffs set by state or district of columbia regulatory commissions that have jurisdiction over washington gas rates 
these rates are intended to provide the regulated utility with an opportunity to earn a just and reasonable rate of return on the investment devoted to the delivery of natural gas to customers 
washington gas also sells natural gas to customers who have not elected to purchase natural gas from unregulated third party marketers 
the regulated utility does not earn a profit or incur a loss when it sells the natural gas commodity as utility customers are charged for the natural gas commodity at the same cost the regulated utility incurs 
at september   the regulated utility was selling and delivering the natural gas commodity to percent of its customers 
the remaining percent of washington gas customers utilized the delivery services of washington gas for delivery of the natural gas commodity purchased from third party marketers  one of which is a subsidiary of washington gas resources 
factors critical to the success of the regulated utility include operating a safe  reliable natural gas distribution system  and recovering the costs and expenses of this business  which include a just and reasonable rate of return on invested capital that is allowed by the regulatory commissions that have jurisdiction over the regulated utility s rates 
hampshire gas company hampshire  a wholly owned subsidiary of wgl holdings  is a regulated natural gas storage business that operates an underground storage field on behalf of washington gas in accordance with a tariff administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
retail energy marketing washington gas energy services  inc wgeservices  a wholly owned subsidiary of washington gas resources  competes with other third party marketers by selling natural gas and electricity directly to residential  commercial and industrial customers  both inside and outside of the regulated utility s traditional service territory 
wgeservices began selling electricity in fiscal year wgeservices has the opportunity to earn a profit or the potential to incur a loss from these sales 
while wgeservices markets the natural gas and electricity commodities  regulated utilities such as washington gas or unaffiliated electric utilities deliver the natural gas and electric commodities to their customers 
no subsidiary or affiliate of the company owns or operates any electric generation  electric transmission or electric distribution assets 
factors critical to the success of the retail energy marketing business are managing the market risk of the difference between the sales price and the cost of natural gas and electricity  managing credit risks associated with customers and suppliers to this segment  and controlling the level of selling  general and administrative costs  most notably customer acquisition costs 
hvac two wholly owned subsidiaries  washington gas energy systems  inc wgesystems and american combustion industries  inc aci  provide turn key  design build  renovation projects to the commercial and government markets 
as a result of a restructuring agreement on september  and a final closing on october wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued  between the company and a percent investor  the company no longer has any investment in primary investors or any financial commitment to the residential hvac investment 
the commercial hvac operations focus on retrofitting a large number of aging commercial and government structures  primarily in the district of columbia and parts of maryland and virginia 
factors critical to the success of the commercial hvac business include the ability to maintain and grow the backlog of existing work  and estimating and managing fixed price contracts 
refer to the business section under item of this report for further discussion of the company s regulated utility and unregulated businesses 
for further discussion of the company s financial performance by operating segment  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
wgl holdings  inc 
primary factors affecting wgl holdings the following is a summary discussion of the primary factors that affect the operations and or financial performance of the regulated and unregulated businesses of wgl holdings 
refer to the business section under item of this report on form k for a more detailed discussion of these and other related factors that affect wgl holdings operations and or financial performance 
weather conditions the company s regulated utility operations are weather sensitive  with a significant portion of its revenues derived from the delivery of natural gas to residential and commercial heating customers during the winter season 
weather conditions directly influence the volume of natural gas delivered by the regulated utility 
the regulated utility s rates are determined on the basis of expected normal weather conditions 
as such  deviations in weather from normal levels can affect the company s financial performance 
washington gas does not have a ratemaking provision that allows for revenues to be adjusted for the difference between actual weather conditions in a particular year and the expected normal weather conditions that are used to establish rates 
however  the regulated utility does have a weather insurance policy designed to protect against a portion of warmer than normal weather refer to market risk included herein for a further discussion of this weather insurance policy 
the financial results of the company s energy marketing subsidiary  wgeservices  also are affected by deviations in weather from normal levels 
since wgeservices sells both natural gas and electricity  wgeservices financial results may fluctuate due to deviations from normal weather during the winter heating and summer cooling seasons 
regulatory environment washington gas is regulated by the public service commission of the district of columbia psc of dc  the public service commission of maryland psc of md and the state corporation commission of virginia scc of va 
hampshire is regulated by the ferc 
these regulatory commissions set the rates in their respective jurisdictions that washington gas can charge customers for its rate regulated services 
changes in these rates as ordered by regulatory commissions affect the company s financial performance 
washington gas expects that regulatory commissions will continue to set the prices and terms for delivery service that give it an opportunity to earn a just and reasonable rate of return on the capital invested in its distribution system and to recover reasonable operating expenses 
gas supply and storage capacity washington gas is responsible for acquiring both sufficient natural gas supplies and resource capacity to meet customer requirements 
as such  washington gas must contract for reliable and adequate delivery capacity to its distribution system  while considering the dynamics of the interstate pipeline capacity market  on system peaking facilities  as well as the characteristics of its customer base 
local distribution companies  such as washington gas  along with other participants in the energy industry have raised concerns regarding the gradual depletion in the availability of interstate pipeline capacity 
depleting pipeline capacity is a business issue that must be managed by washington gas  whose customer base has grown at an annual wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued rate of two to three percent 
this rate of growth is expected to continue 
to date  washington gas has entered into an agreement with an interstate pipeline company that will construct additional capacity for firm transportation and storage services to washington gas 
this pipeline construction project is expected to be completed and in service by the winter season 
washington gas will continue to monitor other opportunities to acquire or participate in obtaining additional pipeline capacity that will improve or maintain the high level of service expected by its customer base 
washington gas believes the combination of the natural gas supply it can purchase under short term contracts  its peaking supplies and the capacity held under contract on the interstate pipelines is sufficient to satisfy the needs of existing customers and allow for growth in future years 
competitive environment competition with other energy products 
the regulated utility faces competition based on customers preferences for natural gas compared to other energy products and the comparative prices of those products 
the most significant product competition occurs between natural gas and electricity in the residential market 
the residential market generates a significant portion of the regulated utility s net income 
in its service territory  washington gas continues to attract the majority of the new residential construction market 
the company believes that consumers continuing preference for natural gas allows washington gas to maintain a strong market presence 
in the interruptible market  the regulated utility s customers must be capable of using a fuel other than natural gas when demand peaks for the regulated utility s firm customers 
in the interruptible market  fuel oil is the most prevalent energy alternative to natural gas 
the regulated utility s success in this market depends largely on the relationship between gas and oil prices 
since the supply of natural gas primarily is derived from domestic sources  the relationship between supply and demand generally has the greatest impact on natural gas prices 
since a large portion of oil comes from foreign sources  political events can have significant influences on oil supplies and  accordingly  oil prices 
the anticipated introduction of non domestic supplies of liquefied natural gas into the united states natural gas market may impact the supply levels and have an impact on natural gas prices 
deregulation and unbundling 
in each of the jurisdictions served by the company s regulated utility  regulators and utilities have implemented customer choice programs 
these programs provide customers with an opportunity to choose to purchase their natural gas and or electric commodity from third party marketers  rather than purchasing these commodities as part of a bundled service from the local utility 
when customers choose to purchase their natural gas commodity from third party marketers on an unbundled basis  there is no impact on the regulated utility s net revenues or net income since washington gas passes the cost of gas to customers without any mark up 
however  these customer choice programs provide unregulated third party marketers  such as the company s unregulated subsidiary  wgeservices  with opportunities to profit from the sale of the natural gas commodity or electricity in competitive markets 
it also enables customers to have competitive choices from which to buy natural gas and electricity 
successfully participating in this evolving marketplace also poses new risks and challenges that must continue to be addressed in the company s current and future strategies 
currently  the regulated utility includes the cost of the natural gas commodity and interstate pipeline services in the purchased gas costs that it includes in firm customers rates  subject to regulatory review 
the regulated utility s jurisdictional tariffs contain gas cost mechanisms that allow it to recover the invoice cost of gas  including both the commodity cost of gas and the interstate pipeline services  applicable to firm customers 
if washington gas were to determine that competition or changing regulation stemming from future unbundling or other initiatives would preclude it from recovering these costs in rates  these costs would be charged to expense without any corresponding revenue recovery 
if this situation were to occur  and depending upon the timing of the occurrence  the effect on washington gas financial position and results of operations would likely be significant 
in the event that a regulatory body disallows the recovery of such costs  these costs would be borne by shareholders 
to minimize this risk  washington gas has mechanisms in its customer choice programs that enable it to assign to participating third party marketers percent of the storage and peak winter capacity resources that were dedicated to serving bundled service customers when those customers elected a third party marketer 
additionally  washington gas currently has mechanisms filed or approved with each of its local commissions to assign up to percent of transportation capacity resources contracted for use during the heating season 
washington gas generally is renewing pipeline transportation and storage capacity contracts to meet its forecasts of increased customer gas requirements and to comply with regulatory mechanisms to provide for or make available such resources to marketers serving customers in the customer choice programs 
wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued unregulated retail energy marketing the company s unregulated subsidiary  wgeservices  competes with other third party marketers to sell the unregulated natural gas commodity to customers 
marketers of the natural gas commodity compete largely on price  and gross margins are relatively small 
wgeservices also competes with other third party marketers to sell electric supply services to customers 
as with natural gas  marketers of electric supply service compete largely on price  and gross margins are relatively small 
wgeservices is exposed to market risks associated with its gas supply  as well as credit risks associated with both its gas and electric suppliers 
see market risk included herein for a further discussion of this risk exposure and wgeservices management of them 
environmental matters the company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations related to environmental matters 
these evolving laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long timeframe to control environmental impacts 
washington gas believes  at this time  that appropriate remediation is being undertaken at all the relevant sites 
based on existing knowledge  washington gas does not expect that the ultimate effect of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its capital expenditures  its earnings or its competitive position 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these matters 
industry consolidation in recent years  the energy industry has seen a number of consolidations  combinations  disaggregations and other strategic alliances 
consolidation will present combining entities with the challenges of remaining focused on the customer and integrating different organizations 
others in the energy industry are discontinuing operations in certain portions of the energy industry or divesting portions of their business and facilities 
from time to time  the company performs studies and  in some cases  holds discussions regarding utility and energy related investments and transactions with other companies 
the ultimate effect on the company of any such investments and transactions that may occur cannot be determined at this time 
economic conditions and interest rates the company and its subsidiaries operate in one of the fastest growing regions in the nation 
the continued prosperity of this region  supported by a relatively low interest rate environment for new housing  has allowed the company s regulated utility to expand its regulated delivery service customer base at a rate of growth well over twice the national industry average during the past five years 
in addition  this economy has provided a robust market for the company s subsidiaries to market natural gas  electricity and other energy related products and services 
a downturn in the economy of the region in which the company operates  or a significant increase in interest rates  which cannot be predicted with accuracy  might adversely affect the company s ability to grow its regulated utility customer base and other businesses at the same rate they have grown in the past 
the company has been operating in a relatively low interest rate environment in the recent past as it relates to short and long term debt financings 
a rise in interest rates without the recognition of the higher cost of debt in the rates charged by the regulated utility to its customers would adversely affect future earnings 
inflation deflation from time to time  the company s regulated utility seeks approval for rate increases from regulatory commissions to help it manage the effects of inflation on its capital investment and returns 
the most significant impact of inflation is on the regulated utility s replacement cost of plant and equipment 
while the regulatory commissions  having jurisdiction over the regulated utility s retail rates  allow depreciation only on the basis of historical cost to be recovered in rates  the company anticipates that its regulated utility should be allowed to recover the increased costs of its investment and earn a return thereon  after replacement of the facilities occurs 
to the extent the company s regulated utility experiences a sustained deflationary economic environment  actual returns on invested capital could rise and exceed returns allowed by regulators in previous regulatory proceedings 
if this were to occur  it could prompt the initiation of a regulatory review to reduce the revenue of the regulated utility 
wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued labor contracts the company has five labor contracts with three labor unions 
the contract with the international brotherhood of teamsters local is a four year contract that was ratified in june and applies to approximately members 
this contract expires on may  the contract with the office and professional employees international union opeiu  local  is a three year contract that began on april   and it applies to approximately members 
during fiscal year  washington gas ratified new labor contracts with opeiu  local  and another smaller union  international brotherhood of teamsters  local shenandoah gas that covers approximately employees 
potential changes in accounting practices the company cannot predict the effect of potential future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general on its operating results and financial condition 
new accounting standards could be issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or the securities and exchange commission sec that could change the way the company records and recognizes revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
these changes in accounting standards could adversely affect the company s reported earnings or increase its liabilities 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires the selection and the application of appropriate technical accounting rules to the relevant facts and circumstances of the company s operations  as well as the use of estimates by management to compile the consolidated financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies involves judgment regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events  including the likelihood of success of particular regulatory initiatives  the likelihood of actualizing environmental estimates  and the probability of recovering costs and investments in both the regulated utility and non utility operations 
the company has identified four critical accounting policies discussed below that require management s judgment and estimation  where such estimates have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for utility revenue and cost of gas recognition 
for regulated deliveries of natural gas  washington gas reads meters and bills customers on a cycle basis 
it accrues revenues for gas that has been delivered but not yet billed at the end of an accounting period 
such revenues are recognized as unbilled revenues that are adjusted in subsequent periods when actual meter readings are taken 
the regulated utility s jurisdictional tariffs contain mechanisms that provide for the recovery of the invoice cost of gas applicable to firm customers 
under these mechanisms  the regulated utility periodically adjusts its firm customers rates to reflect increases and decreases in the invoice cost of gas 
annually  the regulated utility reconciles the difference between the total gas costs collected from firm customers and the invoice cost of gas 
the regulated utility defers any excess or deficiency and either recovers it from  or refunds it to  customers over a subsequent twelve month period 
accounting for regulated operations regulatory assets and liabilities 
a significant portion of the company s business is subject to regulation 
as the regulated utility industry continues to address competitive market issues  the cost of service regulation used to compensate the company s regulated utility for the cost of its regulated operations will continue to evolve 
non traditional ratemaking initiatives and market based pricing of products and services could have additional long term financial implications for the company 
management has relied on its projection of continued regulatory oversight of its operations in order to validate the carrying cost of the regulated utility investment in fixed assets 
washington gas accounts for its regulated activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which results in differences in the application of gaap between regulated and non regulated businesses 
sfas no 
requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue and expense in unregulated businesses 
in certain circumstances  sfas no 
allows entities whose rates are determined by third party regulators to defer costs as regulatory assets on the balance sheet to the extent that the entity expects to recover these costs in future rates 
future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the company and washington gas discontinuing the application of sfas no 
for some of its businesses and wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued require the write off of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that was no longer probable of recovery or refund 
in effect  the company s regulated utility could be required to write off certain regulatory assets that had been deferred on the consolidated balance sheets in prior periods  and charge these costs to expense at the time it determines that the provisions of sfas no 
no longer apply 
if wgl holdings or washington gas were required to discontinue the application of sfas no 
for any of its operations  it would record an extraordinary non cash charge to income for the net book value of its regulatory assets and liabilities 
other adjustments might also be required 
management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas no 
for the company s regulatory activities  and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory environment 
accounting for income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 the company recognizes deferred income taxes for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates 
sfas no 
also requires recognition of the additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes of the regulated utility 
regulatory assets or liabilities corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities may be recorded to the extent the company believes they will be recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process 
amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service 
any significant differences between management s estimates and actual tax amounts could have a material impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
accounting for contingencies 
the company recognizes contingent liabilities utilizing sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
by their nature  the amount of the contingency and the timing of a contingent event are subject to management s judgment of such events and management s estimates of the amounts 
the company currently is involved in a regulatory contingency with respect to a pending rate case 
under the regulations of the scc of va  washington gas placed a proposed general revenue increase into effect on november   subject to refund pending the scc of va s final decision on a rate case proceeding 
revenues recorded in fiscal year related to the virginia rate increase are subject to refund pending a final rate order by the scc of va 
washington gas financial results for fiscal year reflect the proposed revenue increase  along with a provision for a rate refund to customers based on the difference between the amount washington gas has collected in rates subject to refund and the estimated amount washington gas expects to recover based on a final rate order of the scc of va 
to the extent a final order by the scc of va differs from washington gas estimate  washington gas will adjust its provision for rate refund to customers to reflect the impact of the final order 
actual results related to this regulatory contingency are difficult to predict and could differ significantly from the estimates included in reported earnings 
results of operations summary results wgl holdings reported net income of million  or per share  for the fiscal year ended september   as compared to net income of million  or per share  and million  or per share  for fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
the company earned a return of percent  percent and percent  respectively  on average common equity during these three fiscal years 
net income for fiscal year more than doubled the company s net income for the prior year 
the company s core regulated utility operations drove most of the company s significant earnings improvement for fiscal year  reflecting percent colder weather as compared to fiscal year  as well as customer growth and the favorable impact of new retail rates and a new rate design in the district of columbia 
the company s non utility operations also contributed to the favorable earnings comparison for fiscal year  primarily due to after tax charges included in the prior fiscal year totaling million  or per share  associated with the company s former co investment in a residential hvac business and a consumer finance business that is no longer making new loans 
additionally  fiscal year included after tax gains of million  or per share  from the sale of the company s washington dc headquarters property  and million  or per share  from the sale of its interest in a land development venture 
fiscal year also included an adjustment to income taxes that added million to income  or per share  coupled with a reduction to income taxes of million  or per share  due to the realization of tax benefits of capital loss carryforwards 
wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net income for fiscal year fell million  or per share  from fiscal year the decrease in net income primarily reflects percent warmer weather in fiscal year compared to  as well as after tax charges related to the company s former investment in a residential hvac business and a consumer finance business that is no longer making new loans 
fiscal year also included a loss of million  or per share  associated with a transaction with a bankrupt energy trader 
the following table summarizes the company s net income loss by operating segment for fiscal years ended september   and net income loss by operating segment year ended september  in thousands regulated utility a non utility operations retail energy marketing hvac commercial operations residential operating loss residential impairment total major non utility other  principally non utility activities  total non utility net income a regulated utility results include million of expenses shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption eliminations other for fiscal year in order to conform to the current year presentation 
regulated utility operating results the company s utility operations are weather sensitive with a significant portion of its revenue coming from deliveries of natural gas to residential and small commercial heating customers 
for the fiscal year ended september   the regulated utility segment reported net income of million  or per share  representing an increase of million  or per share over fiscal year this significant increase primarily reflects a percent increase in total gas deliveries to firm customers that grew to nearly billion therms during fiscal year due to colder weather  as well as an increase of over  active customer meters during the current fiscal year 
weather  when measured by an industry standard called heating degree days  was percent colder than fiscal year weather was percent colder than normal for the current fiscal year  as compared to percent warmer than normal for the prior fiscal year 
the colder than normal weather for fiscal year contributed an estimated per share to current year earnings 
the improvement in current year earnings was also attributable to new retail rates put into effect in maryland on september   and in virginia on november   as well as the impact of a new rate design in the district of columbia that enables a greater recovery of fixed charges in the summer months of the year 
as discussed earlier  revenues recorded in fiscal year related to the virginia rate increase are subject to refund pending a final rate order by the scc of va 
increased earnings for the utility segment also reflect an adjustment to income taxes during fiscal year that improved net income by million  or per share  coupled with the sale in the second quarter of fiscal year of the headquarters property that resulted in an after tax gain of million  or per share 
this gain reflects management s estimate for potential refunds to customers based on the outcome of regulatory decisions related to this gain 
tempering these earnings improvements were higher labor and benefit costs  higher depreciation expense levels and increased expenses associated with uncollectible accounts 
additionally  the fiscal year included an after tax loss of million  or per share  associated with a transaction with a bankrupt energy trader 
wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in fiscal year  weather was percent warmer than fiscal year  and percent warmer than normal as compared to percent colder than normal for fiscal year the warmer than normal weather reduced earnings by an estimated million  or per share  before considering an million  or per share  improvement derived from a weather insurance policy 
accordingly  the net impact of weather on earnings per share was a reduction of per share 
there were no weather insurance proceeds recorded in fiscal year since  the company has been managing its weather related business risk through an insurance policy that reimburses the company for a portion of the effect of deviations of weather from normal levels when the effect of weather is warmer than normal 
refer to the market risk section of management s discussion for a further description of this insurance policy  and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the related accounting treatment 
further discussion of the operating results of the regulated utility is included herein in the management s discussion for washington gas 
non utility operating results the company s non utility operations are comprised of two business segments retail energy marketing and commercial hvac 
certain of the company s transactions are not significant enough to report as stand alone business segments  and therefore are aggregated as other non utility activities which are included as part of non utility operations for purposes of segment reporting refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
total net income for the company s non utility operations for fiscal year was million  or per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal year this significant improvement of million  or per share  is primarily attributable to after tax charges totaling million  or per share  that were recorded in fiscal year for which there were not similar charges recorded in fiscal year these charges included a million  or per share  after tax operating loss and a million  or per share  after tax impairment provision associated with the company s former percent equity investment in primary investors  a residential hvac business 
there was no effect on fiscal year net income from this venture 
additional charges included in fiscal year included a million  or per share  after tax loan loss provision associated with a consumer finance business 
this business has stopped issuing new loans  and is expected to fully amortize its loan portfolio in also contributing to the improved non utility operating results were reduced income taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year of million  or per share  resulting from the realization of tax benefits of capital loss carryforwards  as well as an after tax gain of  or per share  resulting from the company s sale in the first quarter of fiscal year of its interest in a land development venture 
partially offsetting the favorable year over year comparisons were lower operating results of the company s retail energy marketing and commercial hvac businesses that together declined million  or per share  from fiscal year non utility operations reported a net loss of million for fiscal year ended september   as compared to a loss of million for fiscal year the increased net loss was attributable to after tax charges recorded in fiscal year totaling million for losses associated with the residential hvac and consumer finance businesses  as compared to similar losses recorded in fiscal year totaling million related to the residential hvac business 
partially offsetting the increased loss in fiscal year compared to fiscal year were improved operating results of the company s retail energy marketing and commercial hvac businesses that together improved million over fiscal year the following table depicts the composition of the changes in revenues for the non utility business segments 
composition of non utility revenue changes increase decrease over prior year in millions retail energy marketing commercial hvac wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued retail energy marketing 
the company s retail energy marketing subsidiary  wgeservices  was established in  and sells natural gas on an unregulated  competitive basis directly to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
in fiscal year  it began selling electricity on an unregulated basis 
revenues for this segment have grown over the past three years 
retail energy marketing revenues were million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the retail energy marketing segment had   and  natural gas customers at september   and  respectively 
electricity was provided to  customers at september   compared to  and  customers at september  and  respectively 
wgeservices has also experienced a steady increase in the volume of gas sold  with billion cubic feet bcf sold in fiscal year  compared to bcf and bcf sold in fiscal years and  respectively 
in addition to gas sales  wgeservices sold billion kilowatt hours kwh of electricity in fiscal year  compared to billion kwh and billion kwh in fiscal years and  respectively 
net income for the retail energy marketing segment was million  or per share  for fiscal year  down million from fiscal year the decline in fiscal year was largely caused by a rapid rise in natural gas prices that occurred in late february and early march of the current fiscal year that were more extreme than the planning parameters prescribed in the company s risk management policy 
consequently  the colder than normal weather experienced in resulted in the need to make additional purchases of natural gas in the spot market at a cost above its retail selling price to meet its commitments to customers  thereby reducing gross margins 
gross margins from electricity sales increased due to a percent increase in volumes sold and a percent higher gross margin per kilowatt hour 
electricity is purchased under a full requirements contract from a wholesale energy marketer  mirant americas energy marketing lp maem  which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of mirant corporation mirant 
on july   mirant and substantially all of its subsidiaries filed for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
maem  the sole provider of electricity under the full requirements contract mentioned above  was included in these bankruptcy filings 
since the bankruptcy filing  maem has continued to honor its supply obligations to wgeservices 
future performance by maem may be subject to further developments in the bankruptcy proceedings 
refer to the market risk section of management s discussion for further discussion of maem 
fiscal year earnings for wgeservices were negatively affected by  after income tax benefits  of higher administrative fees that were assessed by the psc of md and the psc of dc 
the assessment by the psc of dc constituted a new annual charge for energy marketing businesses 
net income for the retail energy marketing segment was million for fiscal year  as compared to a net loss of million for fiscal year fiscal year net income reflects increased gross margins from natural gas sales stemming from a percent increase in therms sold to a larger natural gas customer base  as well as an increase in natural gas gross margins per therm as gas costs decreased from levels 
gross margins from the sale of electricity also increased in fiscal year due to larger volumes sold and a slight improvement in gross margins per kwh 
the net loss experienced in by wgeservices was due mainly to acquisition costs associated with entering the electricity market and obtaining new electricity customers 
hvac commercial operations 
two subsidiaries  aci and wgesystems  offer large scale hvac installations and related services to commercial and government customers 
these subsidiaries comprise the company s commercial hvac segment 
until october   wgl holdings held a percent equity investment in primary investors that focused on residential hvac activities 
on that date  pursuant to a restructuring agreement between the company and the other percent investor  the company no longer held an equity investment in primary investors 
revenues for the commercial hvac segment were million for fiscal year  a decline of million from fiscal year this decline reflects the reduction in work performed on behalf of one major customer  as well as an overall decrease in business activity 
in fiscal year and  the company generated revenues of percent and percent  respectively  from one customer  the federal government 
for fiscal year  this segment incurred a net loss of million  or per share  as compared to net income of million  or per share  in fiscal year this decrease is due primarily to reduced business activity and lower gross margins 
commercial hvac revenues were million for fiscal year  a decline of million from fiscal year as a result of a decrease in the number of commercial design and build projects derived from one major customer  wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued a local government 
additionally  fiscal year net income decreased million from reflecting the completion of work for one major customer  and an increase in bad debt expense 
other non utility activities 
as previously discussed  some of the company s transactions are not significant enough on a stand alone basis to warrant treatment as a business segment 
for purposes of segment reporting  these transactions are aggregated as other non utility activities and included as part of non utility operations see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results for other non utility activities of the company for fiscal year improved million  or per share  over the prior fiscal year 
the year over year improvement is the result of a million  or per share  loan loss provision recorded in fiscal year associated with a consumer finance business that has stopped accepting new loans 
favorably affecting fiscal year was also a million  or per share  realization of tax benefits of capital loss carryforwards  as well as an after tax gain of  or per share  from the company s sale of its interest in a land development venture in fiscal year operating results from other non utility activities for fiscal year declined million from fiscal year due to the million consumer finance loan loss provision recorded in fiscal year  as well as a million charge for consolidated tax savings that was allocated to other segments but which had no effect on the company s consolidated statements of income 
lower operating results for fiscal year were also attributable to increased corporate insurance and other miscellaneous expenses of wgl holdings 
other income expenses net other income expenses net improved by million for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
this improvement was the result of after tax gains of million and million related to sales during fiscal year of the headquarters property and interest in a land development venture  respectively 
the favorable comparison over the prior year was also attributable to the inclusion in fiscal year of million of after tax expenses related to uncollectible accounts  as well as an after tax loss of million associated with a transaction with a bankrupt energy trader 
substantially all of these improvements were offset by million of after tax benefits recorded in fiscal year for the proceeds from a weather insurance policy 
there were no weather insurance proceeds recorded in fiscal year other income expense net improved by million for the fiscal year ended september  over the year ended september  this improvement was due primarily to million of after tax benefits recorded in fiscal year for the proceeds from a weather insurance policy  offset by a million after tax charge related to a bankrupt energy trader 
interest expense wgl holdings and subsidiaries interest expense of million for the year ended september  increased  over fiscal year  and decreased million in fiscal year from the following table shows the components of the changes in interest expense between years 
composition of interest expense changes increase decrease from prior year in millions long term debt short term debt other includes afudc total represents allowance for funds used during construction 
the increase in interest expense on long term debt for both fiscal years and reflects an increase in the average balance of long term debt outstanding  partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average cost of these borrowings 
the weighted average cost of long term debt was percent  percent and percent at september   and  respectively 
reduced interest costs wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued related to short term borrowings for both fiscal years and reflects a decrease in the average balance outstanding  combined with a decrease in the weighted average cost of short term debt 
liquidity and capital resources general factors affecting liquidity it is important for the company to have access to short term debt markets to maintain satisfactory liquidity to operate its businesses on a near term basis 
acquisition of natural gas  electricity  pipeline capacity and the need to finance accounts receivable are the most significant short term financing requirements of the company 
the need for long term capital is primarily driven by capital expenditures and maturities of long term debt 
significant swings can take place in the level of short term debt needed by the company due primarily to changes in the price of natural gas and the effect of weather on the volumes of natural gas and electricity that need to be purchased to satisfy customer demand 
satisfactory backup financing to the company s commercial paper program in the form of revolving credit agreements enables the company to maintain access to short term debt markets 
the ability of the company to obtain such financing depends on its credit ratings  which are greatly affected by financial performance and the liquidity of financial markets 
also potentially affecting access to short term debt capital is the nature of any restrictions that might be placed upon the company such as ratings triggers or a requirement to provide creditors with additional credit support in the event of a determination of insufficient creditworthiness 
the ability to procure sufficient levels of long term capital at reasonable costs is determined by the level of the company s capital expenditure requirements  its financial performance  and the effect of these factors on its credit ratings and investment alternatives available to investors 
contract provisions related to a change in the company s creditworthiness might restrict the company s access to short and long term capital 
the company has a goal to maintain its common equity ratio in the mid percent range of total consolidated capital 
in addition  the company typically reduces short term debt balances in the spring because a significant portion of the company s current assets is converted into cash at the end of the winter heating season 
accomplishing these objectives and maintaining sufficient cash flow are necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings for the company and washington gas  and to allow access to capital at relatively low costs 
as of september   total consolidated capitalization  including current maturities of long term debt  comprised percent common equity  percent preferred stock and percent long term debt 
the cash flow requirements of the company and the ability to provide satisfactory resources to satisfy those requirements are primarily influenced by the activities of washington gas and to a lesser extent the non utility operations 
the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its financial obligations 
at september   the company did not have any restrictions on its cash balances that would impact the payment of common or preferred stock dividends by wgl holdings or its subsidiaries 
short term cash requirements and related financing the regulated utility s business is weather sensitive and seasonal  causing short term cash requirements to vary significantly during the year 
over percent of the total therms delivered in the regulated utility s service area excluding deliveries to two electric generation facilities occur during the first and second fiscal quarters 
cash requirements peak in the fall and winter months when accounts receivable  accrued utility revenues and storage gas inventories are at their highest levels 
after the winter heating season  many of these assets are converted into cash  which the company generally uses to reduce and sometimes eliminate short term debt and acquire storage gas for the next heating season 
the company s retail energy marketing subsidiary  wgeservices  has seasonal short term cash requirements resulting from purchasing gas in periods that are not matched with the sale of this commodity 
in addition  wgeservices must finance its accounts receivable for the gas and electricity that it sells  and the accounts receivable balances are seasonal 
both the regulated utility and the retail energy marketing segment maintain storage gas inventory 
storage gas inventories represent gas purchased from producers and are stored in facilities primarily owned by interstate pipelines 
the regulated utility and retail energy marketing subsidiary generally pay for storage gas between heating seasons and withdraw it during the heating season 
significant variations in storage gas balances are usually caused by the wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued price paid to producers and marketers  which is a function of short term market fluctuations in gas costs 
for the regulated utility  such costs become a component of the cost of gas recovered from customers when volumes are withdrawn from storage 
in addition  the regulated utility is able to specifically recover its pre tax cost of capital related to the varying level of the storage gas inventory balance in each of the three jurisdictions in which it operates 
this carrying cost is recovered from customers as a component of gas costs 
variations in the timing of collections of gas costs under the regulated utility s gas cost recovery mechanisms and the level of refunds from pipeline companies that will be returned to customers can significantly affect short term cash requirements 
at september   the regulated utility had a million net under collection of gas costs  compared to a  net under collection at september  washington gas reflects the amounts under collected and over collected in the captions gas costs due from customers and gas costs due to customers  respectively  in the balance sheets 
the increase over the prior year was primarily due to the significant increase in the cost of gas that the regulated utility was unable to pass on to its customers on a timely basis in fiscal year most of the current balance will be collected from  or returned to customers  in fiscal year at september  and  refunds received from pipelines and to be returned to the regulated utility s customers were not material 
the company and washington gas utilize short term debt in the form of commercial paper or unsecured short term bank loans to fund seasonal requirements 
the company s policy is to maintain bank credit facilities in an amount equal to or greater than its expected maximum short term debt position 
as of september   washington gas and wgl holdings each had revolving credit agreements with a group of banks of million and million  respectively  in support of their short term debt requirements 
washington gas and wgl holdings pay facility fees of basis points and basis points  respectively  for the revolving credit agreements that will expire on april  at september   the company had outstanding notes payable of million  compared to million outstanding at september  the increase in notes payable from the prior year is primarily due to an increase in the company s working capital requirements 
at september   current maturities of long term debt were million compared to million at september  long term cash requirements and related financing the company s long term cash requirements primarily depend upon the level of capital expenditures  long term debt maturity requirements and decisions to refinance long term debt 
the company devotes the majority of its capital expenditures to adding new regulated utility customers in its existing service area 
at september   washington gas was authorized to issue up to million of long term debt under a shelf registration that was declared effective by the sec on april  on may   washington gas executed a distribution agreement with certain financial institutions for the issuance and sale of debt securities included in the shelf registration statement 
the company utilizes derivative instruments from time to time in order to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt financing costs 
on june   washington gas entered into two forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional principal of million to mitigate a substantial portion of interest rate risk associated with debt transactions planned during fiscal year  as discussed below 
these swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  are carried at fair value 
at september   the estimated fair value gain related to these swaps totaled million 
these swaps are scheduled to terminate concurrently with the execution of the debt transactions planned for fiscal year refer to notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the accounting for these transactions 
in november  washington gas paid million plus accrued interest to redeem million of percent medium term notes mtns that were due in  and replaced this debt with million of newly issued  percent mtns due in concurrent with the new debt issuance  washington gas terminated million of the total million aggregate notional principal of the forward starting swaps that it had entered into in june  as discussed above 
washington gas received million associated with the settlement of this hedge agreement  which was recorded as a reduction to unamortized debt issuance costs and is being amortized over the life of the newly issued mtns 
the effective cost of the new debt  after considering the gain from the forward starting swap  was percent 
wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued security ratings the table below reflects credit ratings for outstanding debt instruments of wgl holdings and washington gas at september  if the company and or the regulated utility were to experience a change in its debt ratings  the cost of its future short term and long term debt issues would likely change 
furthermore  a ratings change could result in a change in facility fees paid to banks

ratings triggers and certain debt covenants in the event the long term debt of washington gas is downgraded below certain levels  wgl holdings and washington gas would be required to pay higher facility fees on their revolving credit agreements 
also under the revolving credit agreements  the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization can not exceed to percent  and the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense can not fall below to times 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreements  wgl holdings and washington gas are required to inform lenders of changes in corporate existence  financial conditions  litigation and environmental warranties that might have a material adverse effect 
the failure to inform the lenders agent of changes in these areas deemed material in nature might constitute default under the agreement 
a default  if not remedied  may lead to a suspension of further loans and or acceleration in which obligations become immediately due and payable 
in connection with certain gas purchase and pipeline capacity agreements  in the event the long term debt of washington gas is downgraded below bbb by standard poor s or below baa by moody s investors service  or washington gas is deemed by a counterparty not to be creditworthy  the counterparty may withhold service or deliveries  or may require additional credit support 
contractual commitments and commercial commitments wgl holdings has certain contractual obligations that extend beyond fiscal year these commitments include long term debt  lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations for pipeline capacity  transportation and storage services and certain natural gas and electricity commodity commitments 
the estimated obligations as of september  for various fiscal years are shown below 
estimated contractual obligations and commercial commitments assumes normal weather years ended september  in millions total thereafter pipeline and storage contracts medium term notes electric purchase commitments gas purchase commitments wges other long term debt operating leases total wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the table above reflects fixed and variable obligations estimated on the basis of normal weather and average customer usage 
these estimates reflect the likely purchases under various contracts  and differ from minimum future contractual commitments disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements that reflect the company s option to reduce or turn back its available purchase capacity 
based on current estimates  the company does not believe it will exercise this turn back option for fiscal year the estimated contractual obligations and commercial commitments table includes million for pipeline and storage contracts that consist of million for washington gas and million for wgeservices 
mtns and other long term debt of million and million  respectively  represent the principal liability with long term debt maturity payments reflected in fiscal years and beyond 
electric purchase commitments of million are wgeservices expected expenditures based on forecasted usage of its existing customer base 
this commitment is pursuant to an electric purchase contract with a wholesale energy marketer that is contractually tied to a full requirements service with no minimum commitments see the section entitled market risk for a further discussion of this contract 
purchases will fluctuate based on customers actual usage 
wgeservices purchase commitments are million based on a combination of market prices at september  and fixed price contract commitments for gas delivered to washington gas city gate stations  including the cost of transportation to that point  which is bundled in the purchase price 
washington gas had long term contractual commitments for the purchase of natural gas  all of which expired in fiscal year when a customer selects a third party marketer to provide supply  washington gas generally assigns pipeline and storage capacity to third party marketers to deliver gas to washington gas city gate 
in order to provide gas commodity to customers who do not select a third party marketer  washington gas has a commodity acquisition plan to acquire the natural gas supply to serve the customer 
in connection with this plan  washington gas utilizes an asset manager to acquire the necessary supply to serve these customers 
washington gas commitment to the asset manager is to purchase gas supply through march  at a market price that is tied to various public indices for natural gas 
the contract commitment is related to customer demand  there are no minimum bill commitments  and no amount is included in the table above for these contracts 
cash flow from operating activities in fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million as compared to million in fiscal year although net income and non cash charges and credits included in net income increased by million in fiscal year when compared to the same period of fiscal year  primarily as a result of the increase in net income previously described  this improvement in cash flow was more than offset by other factors 
gas costs due from to customers  which represents the difference between gas costs paid to suppliers and the amount of such costs collected from customers  provided million less cash in the current year 
at the end of fiscal year  a significant under collection of gas costs existed that was recovered during fiscal year a similar under collection did not exist at the end of fiscal year  and gas costs paid to suppliers and collected from customers have remained relatively similar during fiscal year although volumes also fell in fiscal year  the price of storage gas rose dramatically and  accordingly  the source of cash derived from storage gas declined million in fiscal year compared to the corresponding change in fiscal year partially offsetting these uses of cash was a million source of cash derived from the change in accounts receivable and accrued utility revenues compared to the prior fiscal year period 
in fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  compared to million in fiscal year the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of the difference between utilizing million of cash in fiscal year for gas costs that were paid to suppliers but unrecovered from customers at september   and subsequently collecting million of these unrecovered gas costs in fiscal year this effect alone contributed million of the increase in operating cash flow in fiscal year a reduction in net cash required to support storage gas balances provided million of the change  and increases in accounts payable of million also contributed to increased operating cash flow 
major offsets to these amounts were a million decline in net income and a million reduction in deferred income taxes primarily associated with the change in the balance of unrecovered gas costs due from to customers 
cash flow from financing activities financing activities for the current year reflect an increased use of cash of million compared to the same period last year  primarily due to a million decline in new long term debt issued  largely offset by a million net increase in notes payable financing primarily to fund the company s increased working capital requirements 
wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal year  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal year this variance was principally attributable to million of cash proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock in fiscal year  and a million greater reduction in notes payable in fiscal year the decline in notes payable is due to a decrease in the company s working capital requirements 
the company derived million more from the net effect of long term debt issuances and retirements in fiscal year than in fiscal year additionally  dividends paid on common stock during fiscal year increased by million over fiscal year the following table reflects the issuances and retirements of long term debt that occurred during fiscal years  and also refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
long term debt activity in millions interest rate amount interest rate amount interest rate amount medium term notes issued retired project financing issued retired a other activity total a includes the non cash extinguishment of project debt financing of million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled million during fiscal year  a decrease of million from fiscal year wgl holdings consolidated capital expenditures were million for fiscal year  down million from the million expended in fiscal year furthermore  the reduction in cash usage includes the effects of cash proceeds from the sales of the former headquarters property and an interest in a land development venture during the second quarter of fiscal year which generated cash proceeds to the company of million and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities increased million during fiscal year capital expenditures for fiscal year increased million from fiscal year levels primarily due to investments in new business construction  which included amounts invested to convert customers from other energy sources 
additionally  other investing activities included the financing of certain construction projects on behalf of the company s commercial hvac subsidiary 
capital expenditures the following table depicts the company s actual capital expenditures for fiscal years  and  and projected capital expenditures for fiscal years through this table excludes the company s investment in primary investors of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the company s capital expenditure program includes investments to extend service to new areas and to ensure safe  reliable and improved service 
the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal year from was primarily attributable to the fact that included a greater number of expenditures related to major system improvements necessary for future customer growth than were incurred in the to projected period includes million for continued growth to serve new customers and million primarily for replacement and betterment projects 
the projected period also reflects million of other expenditures  primarily general plant 
the company believes that the combination of available internal and external sources of funds will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures 
wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued capital expenditures actual projected in millions total new business replacements other total sales and repurchases of accounts receivable in fiscal year  the company stopped issuing new loans associated with its consumer financing operations 
this operation was limited to servicing existing loans 
accordingly  the cash generated from the consumer financing operation was limited to collection of principal and interest for existing loans that reduced the balances in loan pools that previously were created for sale to commercial banks 
through  the company augmented its cash flow by selling loan pools totaling million 
pursuant to the terms under which these loan pools were sold  the company repurchased certain of these loans from the commercial banks totaling million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements financial guarantees wgl holdings and washington gas resources have guaranteed certain purchases of natural gas and electricity on behalf of the retail energy marketing segment 
at september   these guarantees totaled million  of which million were guaranteed by wgl holdings and million were guaranteed by washington gas resources 
as of october   the amount of these guarantees increased by million to million  of which million were guaranteed by wgl holdings 
termination of these guarantees is coincident with the satisfaction of all obligations of wgeservices covered by the guarantees 
wgl holdings may also cancel any or all future obligations imposed by the guarantees upon written notice to the counterparty  but wgl holdings would continue to be responsible for the obligations which had been created under the guarantees prior to the date of the notice of cancellation 
market risk the company is exposed to various forms of market risk including commodity price risk  weather risk and interest rate risk 
the following discussion describes these risks and the company s management of them 
price risk related to regulated utility operations washington gas actively manages its gas supply portfolio to balance its sales  delivery and supply obligations 
the regulated utility includes the cost of the natural gas commodity and pipeline services in the purchased gas costs that it includes in firm customers rates  subject to regulatory review 
the regulated utility s jurisdictional tariffs contain gas cost mechanisms that allow it to recover the invoice cost of gas applicable to firm customers 
in order to mitigate commodity price risk  washington gas obtained regulatory approval in the district of columbia  maryland and virginia to hedge transactions for a limited portion of its sales volumes 
three types of hedge instruments were approved for the company s use i forward gas purchases at a fixed price  ii purchases of call options that effectively cap the cost of gas and iii a combination of call options purchased and put options sold that limits gas price exposure within a narrow band 
as of september   the company had derivative contracts under each approved hedging instrument having a total fair value loss of million refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting for these derivative instruments 
price risk related to retail energy marketing operations the company s retail energy marketing subsidiary  wgeservices  sells natural gas and electricity to retail customers at both fixed prices and indexed prices 
the company must manage daily and seasonal demand fluctuations for these products 
the volume and price risks are evaluated and measured separately for natural gas and electricity 
wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued natural gas 
wgeservices has market exposure to the extent it does not closely match the amount of natural gas it purchases with the related fixed price sales commitments 
if there is a significant deviation of weather from normal that causes purchase commitments to differ significantly from sales levels  the company may be required to buy or sell natural gas at prices that negatively impact gross margins 
wgeservices manages much of this risk by attempting to closely match the timing of its purchases with its sales commitments to customers 
approximately percent of wgeservices annual natural gas sales volumes are subject to variations in demand caused by fluctuations in weather 
purchases of natural gas to fulfill sales commitments are made under fixed volume contracts that assume normal weather 
wgeservices uses storage gas inventory and peaking services offered to marketers by the regulated utility to balance its volumetric requirements 
wgeservices also manages this risk through the purchase of call and put options 
at september   wgeservices had open call and put options valued at  and  respectively  and recorded net gains of  during fiscal year related to these options 
at september   wgeservices had open call and put options valued at  and  respectively  and recorded net losses of  during fiscal year certain suppliers that sell gas to wgeservices have relatively low credit ratings as determined by major credit rating agencies 
depending on the future ability of these suppliers to deliver natural gas under existing contracts  wgeservices could be financially exposed for the difference between the price at which wgeservices has contracted to buy natural gas  and the cost of any replacement natural gas that may need to be purchased 
wgeservices has a wholesale supplier credit policy that is designed to mitigate wholesale credit risks through a requirement for credit enhancements 
per the terms of this policy  wgeservices has obtained credit enhancements from certain of its gas suppliers 
electricity 
for its electric business  wgeservices has significantly limited its volumetric and price risks through a full requirements supply contract with a major generator  maem  which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of mirant 
under the terms of this contract  maem assumes the risk for any volume and price risks associated with sales made by wgeservices 
on july   mirant and substantially all of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
maem was included in these bankruptcy filings 
future performance by maem under its full requirements contract with wgeservices may be subject to further developments in the bankruptcy proceedings 
the performance risk of the maem contract is mitigated through a security and escrow agreement entered into between wgeservices and maem prior to the bankruptcy filing 
under the security and escrow agreement  wgeservices has access to collateral that is intended to cover the difference between the current market price of electricity and the price at which wgeservices has contracted to sell electricity 
in the opinion of counsel to the company  wgeservices has the contractual right to draw on the escrow funds in the account if the contracts between wgeservices and maem are terminated 
the amount of wgeservices exposure in the event of termination of the contracts between wgeservices and maem is estimated to be less than the amount of collateral included in the escrow account 
this estimate of wgeservices exposure to contract termination is based upon acquiring supply  priced at forward electricity prices through the expiration of the existing sales contracts or until wgeservices exercises certain damage limitation provisions of its customers sales contracts 
the actual exposure for wgeservices may differ from the estimate due to changes in timing of any contract termination  deviations from normal weather  changes in future market conditions  or other factors 
since the bankruptcy filing  maem has continued to honor its supply obligations to wgeservices 
in october  wgeservices and maem signed a post bankruptcy petition contract that enables wgeservices to renew expiring contracts with its current electric customers 
value at risk 
wgeservices also measures the market risk of its energy commodity portfolio and employs risk control mechanisms to measure and determine mitigating steps related to market risk including the determination and review of value at risk 
value at risk is an estimate of the maximum loss that can be expected at some level of probablity if a portfolio is held for a given time period 
for the natural gas portfolio  based on a confidence interval  wgeservices maximum value at risk at september  was approximately  for a one day holding period  while the value of the open position was a loss of approximately  this open position measures wgeservices exposure should it need to close all the differential between its purchase and sales commitments 
wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued weather risk the company is exposed to various forms of weather risk in both of its regulated utility and non regulated businesses 
for the regulated utility  a large portion of the company s revenues is volume driven and based upon normal weather 
variations from normal weather will cause the company s earnings to increase or decrease  depending on the weather pattern 
the financial results of the company s non regulated energy marketing business  wgeservices  are also affected by variations from normal weather in the winter relating to its gas sales  and in the summer relating to its electricity sales 
the company manages weather risk with a weather insurance policy and a weather hedge  as discussed below 
weather insurance 
in october  washington gas purchased a weather insurance policy in order to reduce the impact of warmer than normal weather on financial results 
the policy has a five year term that ends september  the policy covers a portion of washington gas estimated net revenue exposure to variations in heating degree days hdds 
the insurance policy defines a heating degree day as the greater of i degrees fahrenheit less the average of the daily high and daily low temperatures in degrees fahrenheit as measured at washington reagan national airport  or ii zero 
for insurance policy purposes  neither average temperatures nor hdds are rounded 
income is provided in the amount of  for each such hdd below  per fiscal year up to a maximum of hdds  subject to certain limitations 
other than the cost of the insurance  washington gas pays nothing if weather is colder than normal 
during fiscal year  weather was percent warmer than normal  resulting in hdds that were covered by the policy 
as a result  washington gas recorded pre tax income in fiscal year due to its receipt of a pre tax payment of million in october  which offset about percent of the estimated financial effect of the year s warmer than normal weather 
no payments were received in connection with fiscal year due to the colder than normal weather 
the policy s pre tax annual premium cost was million for fiscal years  and no portion of the cost or benefit of this policy is considered in the regulatory process 
a further description of the accounting for weather insurance may be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
over the five year term of the policy  washington gas cannot be paid for more than  hdds 
as a result of the hhds used in fiscal year  there are now hdds remaining at september  of these remaining hdds  are available to cover lower impact  higher frequency warm weather conditions between  hdds and  hdds in a given year  and are available to cover severely warm weather between  hdds and  hdds in a given year 
additionally  if over the five year term of the policy the hdds average less than  per year  washington gas will receive an additional payment of approximately million at the end of the five year policy term  reduced for certain interim payments if warm weather occurs before the policy expires 
washington gas has performed extensive simulation analyses indicating that the annual net cash outlay for the policy premiums paid less all benefits received should average  after tax per year over the remaining two year period 
actual year by year cash flows may vary due to policy design and actual weather conditions 
when washington gas reports hdds  it computes hdds using a method different from that used for insurance policy purposes 
washington gas method rounds the average of the high and low temperatures to the nearest whole degree prior to subtracting that average from degrees 
as a result  for each fiscal year in the five year policy period  the number of hdds computed for insurance purposes will almost certainly be greater than the number of hdds reported by washington gas 
therefore  the insurance policy computation will indicate colder weather than washington gas computation  and the annual benefit received will be lower than might be expected if washington gas measure of hdds were used 
for example  last fiscal year s hdd total for insurance purposes was  but was  under washington gas method 
hdd hedge 
wgeservices entered into an hdd hedge to manage its risk for natural gas customers who participate in a program that allows them to pay a fixed amount for their gas requirements regardless of the amount of gas consumed 
the hedge covers a portion of wgeservices estimated net revenue exposure to variations in hdds 
for fiscal year  the company recorded a pre tax gain related to this hedge of  no such gains or losses were recorded for fiscal years or wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest rate risk exposure related to other financial instruments the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its debt financing costs 
management of this risk is discussed below 
long term debt 
at september   the regulated utility had fixed rate mtns and other long term debt aggregating million in principal amount  excluding current maturities  and having a fair value of million 
fair value is defined as the present value of the debt securities future cash flows discounted at interest rates that reflect market conditions as of september  while these are fixed rate instruments and  therefore  do not expose the company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates  they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change 
a total of million  or approximately percent  of the regulated utility s outstanding mtns  excluding current maturities  have put or call options  or a combination of both  allowing either washington gas or the holder of the debt to mitigate this market risk through the early redemption of those debt instruments 
using sensitivity analyses to measure this market risk exposure  the regulated utility estimates that the fair value of its long term debt would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by ten percent 
the company also estimates that the fair value of its long term debt would decrease by approximately million if interest rates were to increase by ten percent 
in general  such an increase or decrease in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
derivative instruments 
as discussed earlier  the company utilizes derivative instruments from time to time in order to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt financing costs 
refer to the liquidity and capital resources long term cash requirements and related financing section of management s discussion  and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these financial instruments 
washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued washington gas light company this section of management s discussion focuses on the financial position and results of operations of washington gas for the reported periods 
in many cases  explanations for the changes in financial position and results of operations for both wgl holdings and washington gas are substantially the same 
primary factors affecting washington gas the principal business and other factors that affect the operations and or financial performance of washington gas include weather conditions changes in regulatory conditions and developments changes in the competitive environment due to energy products deregulation natural gas unbundling gas supply and storage capacity environmental matters industry consolidation economic conditions inflation deflation labor contracts critical accounting policies these factors are generally identical to those factors discussed in the management s discussion of wgl holdings except for certain items and transactions that pertain to wgl holdings and its unregulated subsidiaries which  therefore  are incorporated herein by reference into this discussion 
results of operations summary results washington gas net income applicable to its common stock was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the following table provides the factors contributing to the changes in utility net revenues between years 
composition of utility net revenue changes increase decrease from prior year in millions gas delivered to firm customers volumetric effect impact of rate cases change in variable delivery charges change in fixed system charges total gas delivered to firm customers gas delivered to interruptible customers other total washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued utility net revenues net revenues for washington gas were million for fiscal year  representing an increase of million  or percent  over fiscal year of the million increase in utility net revenues for fiscal year  approximately million of the increase was due primarily to additional volumes sold as a result of percent colder weather compared to the prior fiscal year  and additional customers being served 
an additional million of the current year increase in utility net revenues was attributable to the effect of higher retail rates that went into effect in maryland on september   in virginia on november   and new rates and a new rate design in the district of columbia that enabled a greater recovery of fixed system charges in the summer months of the year 
the decline in volumetric rates in the district of columbia became effective april   substantially outside of the traditional heating season and therefore had minimal effect on fiscal year results 
the virginia rate case is subject to refund pending a final rate order 
utility net revenues were million for fiscal year  a decline of million  or percent from fiscal year  reflecting percent warmer weather than in fiscal year  partially offset by a growth in active customers 
revenue taxes  comprised principally of gross receipts taxes  increased by million in fiscal year and decreased by million in fiscal year changes in revenue taxes primarily are impacted by changes in volumes that increased in fiscal year and decreased in fiscal year the regulated utility is allowed recovery of these amounts from its customers and therefore these fees do not affect total net revenues 
gas deliveries  weather and meter statistics years ended september  gas sales and deliveries thousands of therms firm gas sold and delivered gas delivered for others total firm interruptible gas sold and delivered gas delivered for others total interruptible electric generation delivered for others total deliveries degree days actual normal percent colder warmer than normal active customer meters end of period new customer meters added gas service to firm customers 
the level of gas delivered is highly sensitive to weather variability as a large portion of the natural gas delivered by washington gas is used for space heating 
the regulated utility s rates are based on normal weather and none of the tariffs for the jurisdictions in which it operates currently has a weather normalization provision 
nonetheless  declining block rates in the regulated utility s maryland and virginia jurisdictions  and the existence of a fixed demand charge in all jurisdictions to collect a portion of revenues  reduce the effect that variations from normal weather have on net revenues 
during the fiscal year ended september   firm therm deliveries increased percent over fiscal year to billion therms 
this increase primarily reflects the percent colder weather during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year  and additional customers being served 
weather for fiscal year was percent colder than normal  as compared to percent warmer than normal for the year ended september  in fiscal year  firm therm deliveries decreased percent from fiscal year due to percent warmer weather in fiscal year than fiscal year weather in fiscal year was percent colder than normal 
washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued an increasing number of customers are choosing to buy the natural gas commodity from third party marketers  rather than purchasing the natural gas commodity and delivery service from washington gas on a bundled basis 
gas delivered to firm customers but purchased from third party marketers increased to percent of total firm therms delivered during fiscal year  compared to percent during fiscal year on a per unit basis  washington gas earns the same net revenues from delivering gas for others as it earns from bundled gas sales in which customers purchase both the natural gas commodity and the associated delivery service from washington gas 
therefore  the regulated utility does not experience any loss in net revenues when customers choose to purchase the natural gas commodity from a third party marketer 
gas service to interruptible customers 
therm deliveries to interruptible customers were percent lower in fiscal year than in fiscal year primarily due to customers use of alternative fuels or conversion to firm deliveries as a result of higher natural gas prices 
washington gas must curtail or interrupt service to this class of customers when demand by firm customers exceeds specified levels 
deliveries to interruptible customers during fiscal year increased by million therms  or percent  over fiscal year due to a reduction in interruptible curtailment and higher demand as a result of lower gas costs 
the effect on net income of any changes in delivered volumes and prices to the interruptible class is minimized by margin sharing arrangements embedded in the washington gas rate designs 
under these arrangements  washington gas credits a majority of the gross margins earned on interruptible gas sales and deliveries to firm customers bills 
this margin sharing occurs in exchange for shifting many of the fixed costs of providing service to the interruptible class to the firm class of customers 
gas service for electric generation 
washington gas sells and or delivers natural gas for use at two electric generation facilities in maryland that are each owned by companies that are independent of wgl holdings 
during fiscal year  deliveries to these customers decreased percent to million therms  reflecting the use of alternative fuels primarily due to higher natural gas prices 
these deliveries increased million therms in fiscal year compared to fiscal year washington gas shares a significant majority of the margins earned from gas deliveries to these customers with firm customers 
therefore  changes in the volume of interruptible gas deliveries to these customers do not materially affect either net revenues or net income 
cost of gas the regulated utility s cost of natural gas includes both fixed and variable components 
the regulated utility pays fixed costs or demand charges to pipeline companies for system capacity needed to transport and store natural gas 
the regulated utility pays variable costs  or the cost of the natural gas commodity itself  to natural gas producers 
variations in the utility s cost of gas expense result from changes in gas sales volumes  the price of the gas purchased and the level of gas costs collected through the operation of firm gas cost recovery mechanisms 
under these regulated recovery mechanisms  the regulated utility records cost of gas expense equal to the cost of gas recovered from customers and included in revenues 
the difference between the firm gas costs paid and the gas costs recovered from customers is deferred on the balance sheet as an amount to be collected from or refunded to customers in future periods 
therefore  increases or decreases in the cost of gas associated with sales made to firm customers have no direct effect on net revenues and net income 
revenues can vary widely on an annual basis because of changes in the cost of gas  but such variations will not have any impact on net revenues or net income 
changes in the cost of gas can cause significant variations in the utility s cash provided by or used in operating activities 
the commodity costs of gas invoiced to the utility excluding the cost and related volumes applicable to sales made outside of the utility s service territory  referred to as off system sales were  and per therm for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the higher gas costs in fiscal year reflect higher commodity gas prices associated with greater demand due to colder than normal weather in fiscal year fiscal year gas costs were lower versus fiscal year due to lower demand in the natural gas commodity market caused by warmer weather in fiscal year in relation to normal weather expected for fiscal year and actual weather in fiscal year utility operating expenses operation and maintenance expenses 
operation and maintenance expenses increased million  or percent  for fiscal year over  and increased million or percent for fiscal year over washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in operation and maintenance expenses 
composition of operation and maintenance expense changes increase decrease over prior year in millions labor and labor related expenses pension and post retirement medical and life insurance benefit expenses uncollectible accounts non labor operating expenses total labor and labor related expenses increased by million for fiscal year primarily due to base pay increases and increased incentive pay accruals related to performance based incentive awards  partially offset by fewer employees 
the decrease of million in fiscal year was primarily due to fewer employees and lower incentive pay accruals for performance based incentive awards  net of base pay increases 
the increase in pension and post retirement medical and life insurance benefit expenses for fiscal year was largely due to weaker financial performance related to the company s pension plan  and decreasing interest rates which caused an increase in the discounted liabilities associated with plan benefits 
the increase in these costs for fiscal year was attributable to less favorable financial market conditions and increased expenses as a result of increased estimates of future medical inflation 
the million increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts for fiscal year was driven by the higher natural gas costs and significantly colder weather in than the prior year 
these trends led to a higher level of expenses related uncollectible accounts 
the million decrease in fiscal year reflects lower natural gas costs and warmer weather in fiscal year compared to fiscal year non labor operating expenses for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year  primarily due to a decrease in professional services and billing related costs that resulted from the implementation of various operational enhancements during the year 
these cost reductions were slightly offset by higher costs of public liability insurance 
the million increase in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily attributable to increased professional fees incurred related to improving operational efficiency  as well as for audits  financial services and information technology outsourcing 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization rose by million  or percent  for fiscal year  and by million  or percent  for fiscal year the increased expense for both fiscal years is due to additional investments in property  plant and equipment that were made to meet continuing customer growth and to upgrade or replace existing facilities and systems 
the increase for fiscal year was also attributable to higher depreciation rates in effect for the virginia jurisdiction 
the utility s composite depreciation and amortization rate was percent  percent and percent for fiscal years  and  respectively 
general taxes 
general taxes increased by million over fiscal year primarily due to higher rights of way fees assessed and collected  principally in the district of columbia  as a result of increased throughput volumes during the current fiscal year 
also contributing to the increase were higher property taxes as a result of increased investment in plant equipment 
general taxes decreased by million from fiscal year largely due to a reduction in throughput volumes during fiscal year income taxes 
the statements of income taxes detail the composition of the change in income tax expense for washington gas 
income taxes for the regulated utility increased million in fiscal year over primarily due to higher pre tax income  partially offset by an adjustment of million that reduced income tax expense 
the million decrease in fiscal year from was primarily due to lower pre tax income and deferred tax adjustments 
washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other income expenses net other income expenses net reflects net expense of million for the year ended september   as compared to income of million for the year ended september  the million reduction in income is primarily attributable to several factors 
initially  million of after tax benefits were realized in fiscal year from the proceeds of the weather insurance policy 
there were no proceeds realized from this weather insurance policy during fiscal year due to the colder than normal weather 
substantially offsetting the absence of weather insurance in fiscal year were i a million after tax gain realized in fiscal year related to the sale of the headquarters property  ii a million reduction in fiscal year of after tax expenses related to uncollectible accounts and iii a million after tax charge included in fiscal year related to a transaction with a bankrupt energy trader 
other income expense net improved by million for the fiscal year ended september  as compared to this improvement was due primarily to million of after tax benefits recorded in for the proceeds from the weather insurance policy  offset by a million after tax charge related to a bankrupt energy trader 
interest expense the explanations for changes in washington gas interest expense are generally identical to the explanations included in the management s discussion of wgl holdings which  therefore  are incorporated herein by reference into this discussion 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources for washington gas are generally identical to the liquidity and capital resources discussion included in the management s discussion of wgl holdings except for certain items and transactions that pertain to wgl holdings and its unregulated subsidiaries which  therefore  are incorporated herein by reference into this discussion 
regulatory matters the regulated utility bases its requests for modifying existing rates on increased net investment in plant and equipment  higher operating expenses and the need to earn a just and reasonable return on invested capital 
from through september   the regulated utility had not modified base rates in its major jurisdictions 
commencing in fiscal year  washington gas has increased the frequency for seeking rate relief to ensure its rates remain compensatory 
the following table summarizes major rate applications and results 
washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations concluded summary of major rate applications and results test year allowed return effective months increase in annual on common jurisdiction date ended revenues millions equity requested granted district of columbia a district of columbia district of columbia b maryland maryland b maryland c virginia virginia a the revenue increase includes a reduction for the effect of million lower level of pension and other post retirement benefit costs that had been previously deferred on the balance sheet of washington gas as a regulatory liability 
this deferral mechanism ensures that the variation in these annual costs  when compared to the levels collected from customers  does not affect net income 
therefore  this reduction of annual revenues for pension and other post retirement benefit costs will be reflected as a change to the regulatory liability on the balance sheet since the liability had already been recorded 
additionally  the million annual revenue increase includes an  per year increase in certain expenses that are also subject to the regulatory deferral mechanism treatment 
accordingly  the total annual effect of the order on the company s pre tax income will result in an annual increase of million 
b application was settled without stipulating the return on common equity 
c rates were implemented as a result of a settlement agreement 
the return on equity indicated in the order of percent was not utilized to establish rates
