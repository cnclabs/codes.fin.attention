item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights the significant factors affecting amcore financial  inc s and its subsidiaries amcore or the company financial condition as of december  compared to december  and the results of operations for the three years ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report 
factors influencing forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains  and our periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission and written or oral statements made by the company s officers and directors to press  potential investors  securities analysts and others will contain  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  and the company intends that such forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby with respect to  among other things  the financial condition  results of operations  plans  objectives  future performance and business of amcore 
statements that are not historical facts  including statements about beliefs and expectations  are forward looking statements 
these statements are based upon beliefs and assumptions of amcore s management and on information currently available to such management 
the use of the words believe  expect  anticipate  plan  estimate  should  may  will or similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and amcore undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements in light of new information or future events 
contemplated  projected  forecasted or estimated results in such forward looking statements involve certain inherent risks and uncertainties 
a number of factors many of which are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict could cause actual results to differ materially from those in its forward looking statements 
these factors include  among others  the following possibilities i heightened competition  including specifically the intensification of price competition  the entry of new competitors and the formation of new products by new or existing competitors  ii adverse state  local and federal legislation and regulation  iii failure to obtain new customers and retain existing customers  iv inability to carry out marketing and or expansion plans  v ability to attract and retain key executives or personnel  vi changes in interest rates including the effect of prepayment  vii general economic and business conditions which are less favorable than expected  viii equity and fixed income market fluctuations  ix unanticipated changes in industry trends  x unanticipated changes in credit quality and risk factors  xi success in gaining regulatory approvals when required  xii changes in federal reserve board monetary policies  xiii unexpected outcomes on existing or new litigation in which amcore  its subsidiaries  officers  directors or employees are named defendants  xiv technological changes  xv changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  xvi changes in assumptions or conditions affecting the application of critical accounting policies  and xvii inability of third party vendors to perform critical services for the company or its customers 
critical accounting policies the financial condition and results of operations for amcore presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report  and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon the company s accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below are discussions of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important critical accounting policies to the portrayal and understanding of the company s financial condition and 
table of contents results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood

loans  leases and allowance for estimated losses loans and leases are the company s largest income earning asset category 
loans are recorded at the amount advanced to the borrower plus certain costs incurred by amcore to originate the loan  less certain origination fees that are collected from the borrower 
the carrying amount of loans is reduced as principal payments are made 
payments made by the borrower are allocated between interest income and principal payment based upon the outstanding principal amount  the contractual rate of interest and other contractual terms 
the carrying amount is further adjusted to reflect amortization of the origination costs net of origination fees 
these items are amortized over the expected life of the loan 
the accrual of interest income is generally discontinued non accrual status when management believes that collection of principal and or interest is doubtful or when payment becomes to days past due  except for loans that are well secured and are in a short term  well defined process of collection 
payments received from the borrower after a loan is placed on non accrual status are applied to reduce the principal balance of the loan until such time that collectibility of remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful 
management periodically reviews the loan and lease portfolio in order to establish an estimated allowance for loan and lease losses allowance that are probable as of the respective reporting date 
additions to the allowance are charged against earnings for the period as a provision for loan and lease losses provision 
actual loan and lease losses are charged against reduce the allowance when management believes that the collection of principal will not occur 
unpaid interest attributable to prior years for loans that are placed on non accrual status is also charged against the allowance 
unpaid interest for the current year for loans that are placed on non accrual status is reversed against the interest income previously recognized 
subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged to the allowance  if any  are credited to increase the allowance 
the allowance is regularly reviewed by management to determine whether or not the amount is considered adequate to absorb probable losses 
if not  an additional provision is made to increase the allowance 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans  statistical loss estimates for loan groups or pools that are based on historical loss experience and general loss estimates that are based upon the size  quality  and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  and current economic and industry conditions  among other things 
the allowance is also subject to periodic examination by regulators whose review includes a determination as to its adequacy to absorb potential losses 
those judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are the initial and on going credit worthiness of the borrower  the amount and timing of future cash flows of the borrower that are available for repayment of the loan  the sufficiency of underlying collateral  the enforceability of third party guarantees  the frequency and subjectivity of loan reviews and risk gradings  emerging or changing trends that might not be fully captured in the historical loss experience  and charges against the allowance for actual losses that are greater than previously estimated 
these judgments and assumptions are dependent upon or can be influenced by a variety of factors including the breadth and depth of experience of lending officers  credit administration and the corporate loan review staff that periodically review the status of the loan  changing economic and industry conditions  changes in the financial condition of the borrower and changes in the value and availability of the underlying collateral and guarantees 
while the company strives to reflect all known risk factors in its evaluations  judgment errors may occur 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the amount and timing of interest income and loan and lease 
table of contents losses could be materially different 
these factors are most pronounced during economic downturns 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the amount and timing of losses on loans and leases it is difficult to predict  with any degree of certainty  the affect on income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to adversely affect the adequacy of the allowance by ten percent  an additional provision of approximately million would be necessary

mortgage servicing rights the company recognizes as separate assets the rights to service mortgage loans for others 
mortgage servicing rights that are retained when mortgage loans are sold are recorded by allocating the previous carrying amount of the sold loan between the servicing rights retained and the loans that are sold 
this allocation is based upon the relative fair values of the mortgage servicing rights and the loans sold 
because it is retained as an asset  the amount allocated to mortgage servicing rights will have a favorable impact on the amount of gain or loss that is recognized on the sale of the loans 
the mortgage servicing rights asset is amortized over the projected period of and in proportion to the estimated amount of net servicing income 
amortization of the servicing rights asset will reduce the amount of income that is recorded in the respective period from the servicing of the mortgage loans 
each reporting period  the company re evaluates the fair value of its remaining mortgage servicing rights assets 
the amount that the carrying amount of mortgage servicing rights exceeds the new estimate of fair value is charged against earnings for the period 
rather than directly reducing the carrying amount of the servicing rights asset  a valuation allowance is established for the same amount as the charge against earnings 
in subsequent reporting periods  depending upon current estimates of fair value  the valuation allowance may be reversed 
the reversal is limited to the remaining amount of the valuation allowance and will result in an increase in recorded earnings 
the periodic re evaluation of fair value is based upon current estimates of the present value of remaining net servicing cash flows that incorporate numerous assumptions including the cost of servicing the loans  discount rates  prepayment rates and default rates 
this re evaluation is done by stratifying servicing rights assets into pools based upon one or more predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans that are being serviced 
risk characteristics include loan type and interest rate 
valuation allowances required for one pool cannot be offset by the amount that the fair value of another pool exceeds its carrying amount 
judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are the appropriate risk weighted discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated net future cash flows  prepayment speeds that will determine the amount and period of servicing revenue that is expected to be earned  estimated costs to service the loans and estimated interest earned on amounts collected for real estate tax and property insurance premiums that are held in escrow until payment is due 
these assumptions are based upon actual performance of the underlying loans and the general market consensus regarding changes in mortgage and other interest rates 
for example  declining mortgage interest rates typically result in accelerated mortgage prepayments  which tend to shorten the life and reduce the value of the servicing rights asset 
in addition to the judgments and assumptions affecting the application of this accounting policy  the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 permitted mortgage servicers to restratify their mortgage servicing rights pools 
upon consideration  the company determined that its existing stratification was preferable to other alternatives and chose not to restratify its pools 
this represented the selection of an accounting policy that could have produced different results for had the company chose to restratify its pools 
in general  the greater the number of pools  the greater the likelihood of earnings volatility associated with valuation allowances 
conversely  the fewer the number of pools the less likely there will be earnings volatility 

table of contents if different assumptions and conditions were to prevail  materially different amortization and valuation allowances than those that were recorded may be required 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the value of mortgage servicing rights it is difficult to predict  with any degree of certainty  the affect on income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to adversely affect their value by an additional ten percent  an additional impairment charge of approximately million would be necessary

loan securitization and sale of receivables when the company sells receivables in securitizations of indirect automobile loans  the net carrying amount of the loans is removed from the balance sheet  and certain retained residual interests are recorded 
the retained interests included rights to service the loans that were sold the servicing rights  the excess of interest collected on the loans over the amount required to be paid to the investors and the securitization agent the interest only strip and an interest in sales proceeds that were not remitted by the securitization trust at the time of the initial sale of the loans to the extent it exceeds projected credit losses the credit enhancement or overcollateralization asset 
the carrying value of the loans removed from the balance sheet included the unpaid principal balance of the loans  net of an allocable portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses  minus the portion of the carrying value of the loans that were allocated to the retained residual interests 
these allocations were based upon the relative fair values of the retained residual interests and the loans sold 
because they are retained assets  the amount allocated and recorded for the residual interests had a favorable impact on the amount of gain or loss that was recognized on the sale of the loans 
since the benefits to be received from the servicing rights represent adequate compensation for the company s servicing responsibilities  no asset was recorded for servicing rights 
income from servicing is recognized as earned pursuant to the terms of the servicing agreement and to the extent cash collections from the borrowers exceed payments to the investors and agent 
cash collections in excess of the servicing rights income that is earned is next applied to the interest only strip 
the value allocated to the interest only strip is reduced and interest income is recorded assuming a constant yield based upon the discount rate used to estimate its fair value 
at the end of the estimated life of the securitization  the carrying value of the interest only strip will be fully amortized 
the value allocated to the overcollateralization asset is accreted assuming a constant yield based upon the discount rate used to estimate its fair value 
accretion is recorded as other income for the period 
at the end of the estimated life of the securitization  the carrying value of the overcollateralization asset will have accreted to the amount of the sales proceeds that were not remitted by the securitization trust at the time of the initial sale of the loans  net of projected credit losses 
at that time the cash is expected to be released from the securitization in an amount that equals the accreted value of the overcollateralization asset 
because the company s retained residual interests are subordinated to the interests of securitization investors and the trust agent  there is risk that the carrying value of the interest only strip will not be fully recovered  resulting in a loss charged to earnings 
in addition  since actual credit losses may exceed projected credit losses over the life of the securitization  there is risk that the accreted value of the over collateralization asset will not be fully realized  resulting in a loss charged to earnings 
recourse against the company for credit losses is limited to the amount of the sales proceeds that were not remitted by the securitization trust at the time of the initial sale of the loans 
thus  a loss in excess of the accreted value of the overcollateralization asset is not possible 
each reporting period  the fair values of the interest only strip and the overcollateralization asset are re evaluated based upon current estimates and assumptions of the net present value of residual future cash flows net of remaining expected credit losses 
if this re evaluation results in fair values that are less than the amortized carrying value of the interest only strip and the accreted value of the overcollateralization asset  respectively  and if remaining projected cash flows are less than previously estimated  the carrying values are written down to fair value 
the amount of the write downs is charged against earnings for the current period 
finally  each reporting period  new interest only strip amortization schedules and new overcollateralization asset accretion schedules are developed based upon current estimates  assumptions  adjusted carrying values and revised constant yields 

table of contents judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are estimated defaults  delinquencies and credit losses  projected prepayment speeds and discount rates 
these assumptions are based upon demonstrated credit and prepayment performance of the underlying loans 
these are  in turn  most highly influenced by general economic conditions  with the greatest adverse affect during economic downturns and periods of rapidly falling interest rates 
if different assumptions and conditions were to prevail  noticeably different results could occur because the recorded asset may need to be written off or written down faster than planned and cash flows from the retained residual interests may be less than expected 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the value of the retained residual interests it is difficult to predict  with any degree of certainty  the affect on income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to adversely affect their value by an additional ten percent and the decline was determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge of approximately  would be necessary

branch strategy during  the company launched a strategic initiative to reallocate capital to higher growth midwestern markets  particularly along the i growth corridor between chicago s northwest suburbs and madison  wisconsin the branch expansion 
the company s strategy is to move into a new market where there are strong demographic growth rates and high concentrations of mid size businesses  with a seasoned commercial service staff in a leased facility 
once a book of business is developed and the branch becomes profitable  a more permanent site for a full service retail facility is sought 
at the same time  amcore is exiting certain markets that no longer fit its growth objectives the branch sales 
during the second and third quarters of  the bank sold seven illinois branches and during the first quarter of closed one additional branch 
for the seven illinois branch sales  million in loans  million in deposits and million in premises and equipment were transferred to the respective buyers resulting in net 
table of contents after tax gains of million and million in the second and third quarters of  respectively the branch gains 
loans and deposits for the closed branch were transferred to nearby bank branches 
in the fourth quarter of  the company announced it had reached definitive agreements to sell six wisconsin branches 
the sales closed in first quarter first national bank and trust company of beloit  wisconsin  acquired the clinton and darien branches with combined loans and deposits of approximately million and million  respectively 
the national exchange bank and trust of fond du lac  wisconsin  acquired the montello  kingston  dalton and westfield branches  which have combined loans and deposits of approximately million and million  respectively 
for the wisconsin branch sales  the company will report a combined net after tax branch gain of approximately million in the first quarter of branch expansion activities in included two new offices one on rockford s fast growing east side and one in geneva  illinois  an affluent chicago suburb 
during  the bank opened four commercial loan offices and three full service branches 
the commercial loan offices included three in the chicago suburbs of schaumburg  lincolnshire and des plaines  illinois and one on the east side of madison  wisconsin 
the full service branches included one each in st 
charles and mchenry  illinois and one along the beltway in madison 
as a result of the new office openings  a limited branch office in geneva  illinois and a smaller full service branch in downtown mchenry  illinois were closed 
combined  the nine new locations have generated million in loans and million in deposits as of december  the impact of the branch expansion was a decrease of and per diluted share in and  respectively 
in and early  the company plans to open an additional nine branches in the illinois fox river valley  the chicago suburbs and madison  wisconsin 
the nine branches planned for and early  will require approximately million in incremental capital expenditures and  when considered with all the new offices opened since april   are expected to have a dilutive impact on earnings of to cents per share as start up costs initially outpace net revenues 
the impact of any gains or loss of earnings on the wisconsin branch sales was not factored into the decrease in earnings per share expected in from the branch expansion strategy 
despite this dilutive impact  amcore expects year over year growth in earnings per share from improvements in existing business performance during for and thereafter  the company expects earnings accretion from its branch expansion efforts 
as a complement to its branch expansion  the bank added additional automated teller machines atms in communities in northern illinois and southern wisconsin 
the atms primarily will be located in kelley williamson mobil stations as part of a co branding relationship  and will be owned and operated by an unaffiliated third party 
the bank currently owns and operates atms throughout wisconsin and illinois

the company s retained interests are subordinate to investors interests 
the value of the company s interest only strips subject to prepayment risk and the value of the overcollateralization asset are subject to credit risk on the transferred auto loans 
the investors and the securitization trust have no other recourse to the company s other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due

earnings review of consolidated income statement the following highlights a comparative discussion of the major components of net income and their impact for the last three years 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest income on certain loans and investment securities is not subject to federal income tax 
for analytical purposes  the interest income and rates on these types of assets are adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent or fte basis 
the fte adjustment was calculated using amcore s statutory federal income tax rate of 
adjusted interest income is as follows in thousands years ended december  interest income book basis 



fte adjustment 












interest income fte basis 




interest expense net interest income fte basis 

net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased million or in compared to a decline of million or in the increase in net interest income in was primarily the result of decreased funding costs and an increase in average earning assets 
in  the decline in net interest income was attributable to lower average earning assets  partially offset by improved net interest spread 
the net interest spread is the difference between the average rates on interest earning assets and the average rates on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate margin represents net interest income divided by average earning assets 

table of contents these ratios can also be used to analyze net interest income 
since a significant portion of the company s funding is derived from interest free sources  primarily demand deposits  other liabilities and stockholders equity  the effective rate paid for all funding sources is lower than the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities alone 
as table indicates  the interest rate spread improved basis points to in from in  which was an improvement of basis points from the level of 
the interest rate margin was in  an increase of basis points from in the level was an increase of basis points from in the level of net interest income is the result of the relationship between the total volume and mix of interest earning assets and the rates earned and the total volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and the rates paid 
the rate and volume components associated with interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can be segregated to analyze the year to year changes in net interest income 
changes due to rate volume variances have been allocated between changes due to average volume and changes due to average rate based on the absolute value of each to the total change of both categories 
because of changes in the mix of the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the computations for each of the components do not equal the calculation for interest earning assets as a total and interest bearing liabilities as a total 
table analyzes the changes attributable to the volume and rate components of net interest income 
changes due to volume in  net interest income on an fte basis increased due to average volume by million 
this was comprised of an million increase in interest income that was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense 
in  net interest income on an fte basis decreased due to average volume by million 
this was comprised of a million decline in interest income that was partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
the increase in interest income of million was largely the result of a million or increase in average loans 
average installment and consumer loans  primarily indirect automobile lending  increased million  while average commercial real estate and average commercial  financial and agricultural loans increased million and million  respectively 
the combined increase in commercial lending was primarily driven by amcore s branch expansion in the chicago suburban and madison area markets  notwithstanding the stricter pricing policies  tightened credit standards implemented in previous years and the continuing sluggish business environment 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in average residential real estate loans of million due to the impact of refinancings  as mortgage interest rates dropped to forty year lows 
the increase in average earning assets was funded by a million increase in average interest bearing deposits  plus a million increase in non interest bearing deposits 
the combined increase was comprised of a million increase in brokered deposits and a million or increase in core deposits 
the growth in core deposits reflects company wide initiatives to attract additional core deposits as well as deposit growth attributable to the branch expansion 
over of the core deposit growth was attributable to primary transaction account business  which is the company s lowest cost funding source 
growth in core deposits was insufficient to fund loan growth  leading to the increase in brokered deposits 
amcore recognizes the importance of continued core deposit growth  not only as a means of funding the branch expansion  but also to continue the strategy expressed in of reducing its reliance on wholesale funding sources 
strong well established markets  the transition to full service retail branches in new markets as the branch expansion develops  continued emphasis on attracting and retaining primary transaction accounts  and asset securitization are all means by which the company expects to implement these strategies 
the decline in interest income of million was driven by a million or decline in average loans and a million or decline in average investment securities 
the decrease in average loans was 
table of contents led by a million average decrease in family real estate loans due to refinancings and the mortgage securitization 
refinancings were prompted by falling mortgage interest rates which reached a forty year low during installment and consumer loan volume decreased million  on average  as a result of the auto loan sales 
commercial loan volume declined an average million due to stricter pricing policies  tighter credit standards and the recession 
these declines also reflect the impact of million in loans transferred as part of the branch sales 
the decline in average investment securities was the result of amcore s security portfolio restructuring  de leveraging and prepayments driven by falling interest rates 
planned reductions primarily focused on mortgage related securities with a higher degree of interest rate risk associated with changing prepayment speeds 
the strategy also focused on reducing certain other securities with low yields and or longer durations 
the decline in average earning assets led to a million or decrease in average interest bearing liabilities and the resulting million volume related reduction in interest expense 
this was largely attributable to a million average reduction in wholesale funding  including brokered deposits 
this was a deliberate strategy aimed at reducing the company s reliance on these higher cost funding sources  which included the debt extinguishment  and to reduce interest rate risk 
also included in the decrease is the impact of million in deposits that were assumed by the buyers as part of the branch sales 
changes due to rate during  net interest income on an fte basis increased due to average rates by million when compared with this was comprised of a million decline in interest expense that was partly offset by a million decrease in interest income 
during  net interest income on an fte basis increased due to average rates by million  when compared with this was comprised of a million decline in interest income that was more than offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
the yield on average earning assets declined basis points in  compared to the yield on average loans fell by basis points  while the yield on average securities fell by basis points 
the decline in loan yields was primarily attributable to commercial real estate and commercial loans 
loans that refinanced during the year  variable priced loans and new loan production were all adversely impacted by the decline in interest rates that occurred throughout and  driving overall yields down year over year 
the decline in security yields was affected by the sale of higher risk securities in the security portfolio restructuring and the prepayment of higher yielding mortgage related securities that occurred as mortgage interest rates fell 
these securities were replaced with lower yielding securities due to the current interest rate environment 
the rate on interest bearing liabilities declined basis points during compared to  due to lower deposit and short term borrowing rates 
while rates fell on all deposit products  the decrease was most pronounced on certificates of deposit cd s and the company s indexed money market deposit accounts amdex 
average rates on cd s have declined as older cd s bearing higher rates have matured and re priced since the decline in interest rates that have occurred over the past two years 
the amdex accounts re price monthly off the three month treasury bill discount rate  and have also benefited from the decline in short term interest rates 
the decrease in short term borrowing rates was largely the result of lower rates paid on reverse repurchase agreements as short term interest rates have declined 
the yield on average earning assets declined basis points in  compared to the yield on average loans fell by basis points and was primarily attributable to commercial and commercial real estate loans 
falling interest rates during the year impacted pricing on new loan volume  variable priced loans and loans that refinanced during the year 
the yield on average securities decreased by basis points  also the result of declining interest rates 
yields on securities were also affected by the sale of higher risk securities in the security portfolio restructuring and de leveraging as well as the pre payment of higher yielding securities that occurred as interest rates fell 

table of contents the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities declined basis points in  compared to this was primarily due to decreased rates paid on deposits and short term borrowings 
the decrease in deposit costs was largely driven by amdex deposit accounts that benefited from the decline in short term interest rates 
the decrease in short term borrowing costs was mainly due to reverse repurchase agreements that renewed at lower rates  also due to the decline in short term interest rates 
the current and projected interest rate environments are expected to result in improved interest rate spreads and margins in  compared to specifically  the company expects continuing benefits from deposit re pricing during the coming year 
it will also realize a full year s benefit from an expired interest rate swap that negatively impacted funding costs in by million or basis points 
among those factors that could cause margins and spreads not to improve as anticipated by the company in include  unexpected changes in interest rates  changes in the slope of the yield curve  the effect of prepayments or renegotiated rates  changes in the mix of earning assets and the mix of liabilities  including greater than anticipated reliance on expensive wholesale sources to fund the branch expansion and wisconsin branch sales and greater than expected delinquencies resulting in non accrual status

commercial charge offs increased during  partially the result of settlements reached with several borrowers to terminate or avoid costly litigation or protracted negotiation 
retail and installment loans also experienced increased charge offs in  the result of increasing unemployment and the weakening economy that affected the borrower s ability to repay their loans 
future growth in the loan portfolio  further weakening or continued uncertainties in economic conditions  changes in underlying collateral values  specific credit deterioration  or a change in management s workout strategies on high risk or non performing loans  among other things  could result in provisions in that are materially higher than those for non interest income total non interest income is comprised primarily of fee based revenues from trust and asset management activities  bank related service charges on deposits and mortgage revenues

table of contents earnings review by business segment amcore s internal reporting and planning process focuses on four primary lines of business or segments commercial banking  retail banking  trust and asset management  and mortgage banking 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presents a condensed income statement and selected balance sheet information for each segment 
the financial information presented was derived from the company s internal profitability reporting system that is used by management to monitor and manage the financial performance of the company 
this information is based on internal management accounting policies which have been developed to reflect the underlying economics of the segments and  to the extent practicable  portray each segment as if it operated on a stand alone basis 
thus  each segment  in addition to its direct revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  includes an appropriate allocation of shared support function expenses 
the commercial and retail banking segments also include funds transfer adjustments to appropriately reflect the cost of funds on loans made and funding credits on deposits generated 
apart from these adjustments  the accounting policies used are similar to those described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
since there are no comprehensive authorities for management accounting equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the information presented is not necessarily comparable with similar information from other financial institutions 
in addition  methodologies used to measure  assign and allocate certain items may change from time to time to reflect  among other things  accounting refinements  changes in risk profiles  changes in customers or product lines  and changes in management structure 
the presentation of segments was changed in the first quarter of to reflect the company s shift to a line of business structure 
the primary impact of this change was to segregate the previous banking segment into its retail and commercial components 
however  due to allocation methodologies for shared support costs  fund transfer pricing adjustments for loans cost of funds allocations and deposits funds credit allocations and the exclusion of investment and treasury activities from either the retail or commercial banking segments  the sum of these two new segments will not equal the total of the old banking segment presentation 
prior period segment results have been restated to reflect the new line of business structure 
the trust and asset management segment and the mortgage banking segment were not affected by the shift to a line of business structure and have not been restated 
total segment results differ from consolidated results primarily due to intersegment eliminations  certain corporate administration costs  items not otherwise allocated in the management accounting process and treasury and investment activities 
the impact of these items is aggregated to reconcile the amounts presented for the segments to the consolidated results and are included in the other column of note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for ease of comparison  the discussion of each segment  including the segment profit percentage  focuses on earnings before the extraordinary item and the accounting change the operating profit or operating loss 
in addition  due to its unusual and non recurring nature  the branch gain has not been allocated to either the commercial or retail segments 
it is included in the other column 
commercial banking the commercial banking segment commercial provides commercial banking services to large and small business customers through the bank s banking locations in northern illinois and south central wisconsin 
the services provided by this segment include lending  business checking and deposits  cash management  merchant card services and other traditional as well as e commerce commercial banking services 
commercial operating profit for was million  an increase of million or from this followed a decline in of million or from an operating profit of million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased net interest income  increases in non interest income and decreased provision 
these were partially offset by increased operating expenses and income taxes 

table of contents net interest income increased million in the increase was due to increased loan volumes  particularly commercial real estate loans  lower priced deposits and decreased net cost of funds allocations  which more than compensated for lower yields on loans 
the lower yields on loans  reduced rates on deposits and decreased net cost of funds allocations were all attributable to declining short term interest rates over the previous year 
strong loan demand  aided by the branch expansion  was more than sufficient to replace average loan balances transferred in the branch sales leading to the increased volumes 
non interest income increased million in the increase was attributable to increased service charge income associated with commercial deposit account analysis and letter of credit fees 
lower short term interest rates reduced the value of account balances maintained to compensate the bank for deposit services  resulting in higher fees collected for account maintenance 
the provision decrease from was million 
the decrease in the provision was primarily related to decreased charge offs in  as compared to  and additions to the allowance in prompted by concerns about delinquencies  concentrations and the economy s impact on the commercial portfolio 
comparable additions were not necessary during operating expenses increased million in the increase was largely due to higher personnel expenses  which included the impact of the branch strategy  and a higher allocation of shared support function costs 
these increases were partially offset by the discontinuation of goodwill amortization pursuant to sfas no 
income taxes increased million in  primarily the result of higher income before taxes 
the commercial segment represented  and of total segment operating profit in  and  respectively 
retail banking the retail banking segment retail provides retail banking services to individual customers through the bank s banking locations in northern illinois and south central wisconsin

retail operating profit for was million  an increase of million or from this followed a decline in of million or from an operating profit of million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased net interest income 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline in non interest income  increased provision and higher income taxes 
net interest income increased million in the increase was due to increased loan volumes  particularly indirect automobile loans net of reduced residential real estate loans  and lower priced deposits  which more than offset lower yields on loans and reduced net funds credit allocations 
the lower yields on loans  reduced rates on deposits and decreased net funds credit allocations were all attributable to declining short term interest rates over the previous year 
auto loan sales in and strong demand in led to the increase in indirect automobile loan volume year over year 
declining volumes on residential real estate loans were driven by accelerated prepayments due to falling mortgage interest rates and the branch sales 
in all other retail loan categories  the impact of the branch expansion was essentially offset  on average for the year  by the impact of the illinois branch sales 
non interest income declined  in increased deposit service charge income  other customer service fees and a gain on the sale of excess land were more than offset by decreased commissions from mortgage originations and gain on auto loan sales in the decrease in mortgage origination commissions was due to the transfer of mortgage originator staff to the mortgage banking segment 

table of contents the provision increase from was  the increase in the provision was primarily related to increased charge offs and growth in loan balances in increased allocations made in for specific non conforming real estate loans were decreased in due to the sale of a portion of that portfolio 
operating expenses  in total  were relatively unchanged year to year 
increased allocations of shared support function and home office costs  as well as increased personnel costs were essentially offset by the discontinuation of goodwill amortization pursuant to sfas no 
and lower foreclosed real estate costs 
income taxes increased  in  primarily the result of higher income before taxes 
the retail segment represented  and of total segment operating profit in  and  respectively 
trust and asset management the trust and asset management segment tam provides trust  investment management  employee benefit recordkeeping and administration and brokerage services

the tam segment s operating profit for was million  an increase of  or from this followed a million or decline from an operating profit of million in the increase was primarily due to lower operating expenses and income tax expense  which were nearly offset by a decline in non interest income 
declines in fee based revenue  partly offset by increased brokerage commission income  were responsible for a million decrease in non interest income 
the declines in the equity market have impacted the value of amcore administered assets  which in turn have caused a reduction in fee based revenue 
net brokerage commissions on the other hand have been particularly strong and are primarily the result of increased fixed annuity sales 
in addition  processing costs associated with annuity sales  which are netted against commissions  have declined as the tam segment is now processing its own sales 
operating expenses decreased million in and is primarily related to the discontinuation of goodwill amortization pursuant to sfas no 
lower personnel costs and decreased allocations of shared support function and home office costs  net of an increase in data processing costs and other losses  associated with reimbursements to customers and funds  also contributed to the decrease in operating expenses 
income taxes declined  for the decrease in taxes is related to declines in pre tax operating profit  exclusive of the change related to the discontinuation of goodwill amortization  which was not tax deductible 
the tam segment manages or administers billion of investments  inclusive of traditional assets as well as the management of the bank s diverse fixed income portfolio of approximately billion 
assets in the amcore vintage mutual funds totaled million 
the tam segment represented  and of total segment operating profit in  and  respectively 
mortgage banking the mortgage banking segment mortgage provides a variety of mortgage lending products to meet its customer needs 
it sells these loans to the bank and the secondary market and continues to service most of the loans sold 

table of contents the mortgage segment s operating profit was million in  compared to in  a decline of  or 
this follows an increase of million or from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to higher operating costs and lower non interest income 
net interest income increased  during this was primarily due to higher average mortgage loans held for sale in compared to  net of associated funding costs 
non interest income for  which for the mortgage segment is net of servicing right amortization and impairment  declined  from closing volumes were million in  a second consecutive year of record closings  compared to million in increased amortization and impairment of servicing rights  due to the accelerated run off of the portfolio and increasing prepayment speeds  and a lower of cost or market write down on mortgages held for sale more than offset otherwise strong revenue gains from the increased volumes 
operating expenses increased  in compared to the increase was primarily due to higher commissions that were paid due to the increase in mortgage volumes 
other increases in personnel costs  due to the transfer of the mortgage originators from the retail segment  were essentially offset by the elimination of affiliate commissions due to the transfer 
the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced at december   including loans held for sale and loans serviced for the bank  was unchanged from a year ago at billion 
the mortgage segment represented  and of total segment operating profit in  and  respectively 
balance sheet review and liquidity risk management liquidity management is the process by which the company  through its asset and liability committee alco and treasury function  ensures that adequate liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 
these commitments include funding credit obligations to borrowers  funding of mortgage originations pending delivery to the secondary market  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due or called  maintaining adequate collateral for secured deposits and borrowings  paying dividends to shareholders  payment of operating expenses  funding capital expenditures and maintaining deposit reserve requirements

the change was attributable to a million increase in proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale  net of increased originations of such loans  primarily attributable to the mortgage segment s origination and sale of loans into the secondary market 
the million of cash used for investing activities during contrasts with million provided in  for an increase of million in cash used between the two years 
this was primarily the result of a million net increase in loans and leases and a million decrease in the amount of proceeds from investment sales 
the net increase in loans and leases was due in large part to branch expansion in compared to branch sales in  while the decrease in proceeds from investment sales was mainly due to the security portfolio restructuring 
the million of cash provided by financing activities during contrasts with million used during  or an increase of million in cash provided 
this was primarily the result of a million net increase in cash provided by demand  savings and time deposit accounts  million in cash required in to fund the branch sales and a million decrease in cash used for net treasury stock repurchases 
the net increase in deposit accounts reflects company wide initiatives to attract additional core deposits as well as the branch expansion in compared to the branch sales in the decrease in cash used to fund treasury stock repurchases is due to the completion of the company s stock repurchase programs

in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
on january   million of held to maturity securities were reclassified to available for sale 
thus  as of december   all securities are classified as available for sale 
the company believes the reclassification will improve amcore s ability to manage interest rate and liquidity risk 
fluctuations in the unrealized gain or loss component of total stockholders equity may result  however  federal banking regulations generally exclude this component from regulatory risk based capital calculations 
the securities portfolio serves an important role in the overall context of balance sheet management in terms of balancing capital utilization and liquidity 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment  liquidity and credit considerations 
the portfolio s scheduled maturities and the prepayment of mortgage and asset backed securities represent a significant source of liquidity 
approximately million  or  of the securities portfolio will contractually mature in this does not include mortgage and asset backed securities 
mortgage and asset backed security maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without penalties 
for example  scheduled maturities for  excluding mortgage and asset backed securities  were million  whereas proceeds from actual maturities  which included prepayments of mortgage and asset backed securities  were million 
this compares to proceeds of million and million in and  respectively

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of its normal operations  amcore is subject to interest rate risk on the interest earning assets it invests in primarily loans and securities and the interest bearing liabilities it funds with primarily customer deposits  brokered deposits and borrowed funds  as well as its ability to manage such risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market values of amcore s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
like most financial institutions  amcore has an exposure to changes in both short term and long term interest rates 
in the near term  amcore expects that its interest rate risk will be greater should interest rates continue to decline 
while amcore manages other risks in its normal course of operations  such as credit and liquidity risk  it considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of amcore s business activities and operations 
in addition  since amcore does not hold a trading portfolio  it is not exposed to significant market risk from trading activities 
during  there were no material changes in amcore s primary market risk exposures 
based upon current expectations  no material changes are anticipated in the future in the types of market risks facing amcore 
table and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements summarize amcore s market risk and interest sensitivity position as of december  the amounts and assumptions should not be relied upon as indicative of expected actual results since  like most financial institutions  amcore s net interest income can be significantly impacted by external factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to overall economic conditions  policies and actions of regulatory authorities  the amounts of and rates at which assets and liabilities re price  variances in prepayment of loans and securities other than those that are assumed  early withdrawal of deposits  exercise of call options on borrowings or securities  competition  a general rise or decline in interest rates  changes in the slope of the yield curve  changes in historical relationships between indices and balance sheet growth 
amcore s asset and liability management process is utilized to manage market and interest rate risk through structuring the balance sheet and off balance sheet portfolios to maximize net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of risk to changes in market interest rates 
while achievement of this goal requires a balance between profitability  liquidity and interest rate risk  there are opportunities to enhance revenues through controlled risk 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is performed monthly using various simulations with an asset liability modeling system 
these analyses are reviewed by the asset and liability committee alco  whose actions attempt to minimize any sudden or sustained negative impact that interest rate movements may have on net interest income 
alco reviews the impact of liquidity  loan and deposit pricing compared to its competition  capital adequacy and rate sensitivity  among other things  and determines appropriate policy direction to maintain or meet established alco guidelines 
the company may  from time to time  use derivative contracts to help manage its exposure to changes in interest rates and in conjunction with its mortgage banking operations 
the derivatives used most often are interest rate swaps  caps  collars and floors collectively interest rate derivatives  mortgage loan commitments and forward contracts 
interest rate derivatives are contracts with a third party the counter party to exchange interest payment streams based upon an assumed principal amount the notional principal amount 
the notional principal amount is not advanced from the counter party 
it is used only as a reference point to calculate the exchange of interest payment streams 
management will  from time to time  use derivative contracts to help manage its exposure to interest rate risk by modifying the existing interest rate risk characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 
the derivatives most commonly utilized in the asset liability management program are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
amcore does not have any derivatives that are held or issued for trading purposes 
the only credit risk exposure amcore has is in relation to the counter parties  which all have investment grade credit ratings 
all counter parties are expected to meet any outstanding interest payment obligations 

table of contents the total notional amount of swap contracts outstanding was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   swap contracts had an aggregate positive carrying and fair value of million 
the total notional amount of collars outstanding was zero at december   versus million outstanding as of the end of the total notional amount of caps outstanding was million at december   with million of outstanding caps as of the end of as of the end of  the caps had an aggregate carrying and fair value of  see table for further discussion of derivative contracts  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
based upon an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points and no change in the slope of the yield curve  the potential increase in net interest income for would be approximately million or of base forecasted net interest income 
this analysis assumes no growth in assets or liabilities and replacement of maturing instruments with like kind instruments 
at the end of  comparable assumptions would have resulted in a potential decrease in net income of  or 
amcore has moved to an asset sensitive position with net interest income projected to increase if rates were to rise 
this shift reflects the company s repositioning of its balance sheet in anticipation of economic recovery and increased interest rates 
a material factor in this repositioning is the significant increase in the amount of floating rate commercial loans on the balance sheet 
at december   variable rate loans comprised of the commercial loan portfolio 
at december   this percentage had increased to 
conversely  an immediate decrease in interest rates of basis points and no change in the slope of the yield curve would result in a potential decrease in net interest income for of million or of base forecasted net interest income 
at the end of  a similar decrease in rates would have resulted in a potential decrease in net interest income of million or 
amcore s sensitivity to declining interest rates has more than doubled since the end of with further declines in interest rates the decrease in asset yields would outpace liability rate reductions due to compression on non maturity and indexed liability products  the increased volume of floating rate commercial loans  and the negative convexity of the mortgage backed products 
the amounts and assumptions used in the rising and falling rate scenarios should not be viewed as indicative of expected actual results 
in addition to rising or falling interest rates  amcore s net interest income can be significantly impacted by a variety of external factors  such as those previously noted 
in addition  as interest rates move  the alco is likely to adjust interest rate risk management strategies to limit  to the extent possible  the adverse impact that such changes in interest rates might otherwise have on amcore s net interest income  as well as maximize potential positive impacts such movements might have
