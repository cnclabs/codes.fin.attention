item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with accompanying financial statements 
dollar amounts are in thousands except per share amounts and where noted 
productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
year ending total assets were almost the same in all categories as because total assets were slightly lower and sales activity increased relative to  utmd continued to increase its total asset turns from to  which helped return on average shareholders equity roe 
ending current assets declined as a result of substantially reduced receivables which more than offset higher inventories 
net fixed assets increased despite depreciation of  that exceeded new purchases of because the us dollar usd value of the company s existing assets in ireland increased due to currency conversion from euro to usd 
net intangible assets declined from amortization of patents and other intellectual property 
after adoption of fasb rule no 
 utmd suspended amortizing goodwill from acquisitions which in resulted in a decrease in intangible assets 
year ending and net intangible assets were of total assets 
in  asset turns are expected to benefit from projected sales growth while working capital remains about the same  excluding cash 
depreciation of fixed assets should continue to exceed purchases 
net intangible assets will not materially change  absent a new acquisition or a determination that current goodwill is impaired 
cash accumulation which results from operations and or receipt of damages from tyco may reduce asset turns in the absence of a new acquisition or share repurchases 
management targets total asset turns excluding cash accumulation at or higher than in order to not negatively affect roe 
net property  plant and equipment pp e in the us  due to depreciation in excess of acquisitions  decreased  while in ireland increased  despite no significant new ireland purchases and depreciation expense of with higher consolidated sales and constant pp e in usd terms  pp e turns increased to from the current book value of consolidated pp e is of acquisition cost 
management believes pp e to be in good working order and capable of supporting increased sales activity 
as a result  going forward  financial performance should be enhanced by lower rates of depreciation and continuing higher pp e turns 
under fasb statement no 
 which utmd adopted in  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
utmd s future income statement performance would only be affected in the case of impairment 
the goodwill on utmd s balance sheet is the result of two acquisitions in and which were made in cash at conservative valuations 
as of december   the goodwill on the balance sheet had been reduced by from the acquisition price  as a result of utmd using previous gaap for the purchase method of acquisition accounting 
the acquired gesco neonatal products and cmi continue to be viable parts of utmd s overall business activities  representing of total sales in net goodwill on the december  balance sheet is of sales 
utmd does not expect its goodwill intangible assets to become impaired in the foreseeable future 
average inventory turns decreased in to from because of utmd s decision to build intran plus inventory to be properly prepared for anticipated increased demand as a result of the injunction against tyco kendall for its infringing product  and the possibility of better access to physicians in hospitals as a result of new gpo codes of conduct prohibiting bundling of physician preference products with unrelated products 
management continues to target average inventory turns as its objective  and believes inventory turns will improve in year ending accounts receivable a r balances declined 
calculated average days in a r at on december   based on q shipment activity  were well within management s objective of days 
a r over days from invoice date were about of total a r at year end  compared to at year end the company believes these older a r are collectible or within its reserve balances for uncollectible accounts 
working capital at year end was the same as year end at million because current assests and current liabilities both decreased by million 
utmd s current ratio improved to from excluding use of cash for acquisitions or share repurchases  utmd expects that working capital will increase as a result of cash generated from operations after bank debt is repaid 
b liabilities 
in the three years  utmd s total liabilities and total debt ratio have been driven by the timing of debt incurred for financing share repurchases  not in providing cash to operate its business 
except for the oregon facility involved as part of the cmi acquisition and a portion of utmd s midvale parking lot  the company generally owns its pp e assets 
pp e assets are dominated by utah and ireland manufacturing facilities  molds  production tooling and equipment  test equipment  computer communications equipment and software 
at the end of  utmd s total debt ratio increased to from at the end of because the year end line of credit balance increased by million 
the timing of borrowing about million in november to complete a tender offer under which utmd repurchased million shares at a cost of million was responsible for the change 
utmd had previously borrowed million in july to complete a tender offer repurchase of million shares and another million in september to complete a tender offer repurchase of another million shares 
the debt incurred to finance those previous repurchases had been fully repaid in early without additional significant share repurchases or a new acquisition  utmd will be able to eliminate its current bank debt in  yielding a total debt ratio less than by the end of the year 
results of operations 
a revenues 
global consolidated sales increased in compared to foreign international sales increased ten percent  and us domestic sales declined less than one percent 
utmd divides its domestic sales into two primary distribution channels direct sales which are sales to end user customers by utmd s direct sales force  independent commissioned sales reps  specialty distributors and national hospital distribution companies  and oem sales which are sales to other companies where products are packaged and resold as part another company s product offerings 
as a percentage of total domestic sales  direct sales represented compared to in both and the remaining of domestic sales in were domestic oem sales 
in each of the years  domestic direct sales represented of global consolidated sales 
international sales in were of global consolidated sales compared to and in years and respectively 
of the foreign sales  were made in europe compared to and in and ireland operations shipped of foreign sales in us dollar terms in compared to in and in shipments from utmd ltd 
ireland were up in euro terms and up in us dollar terms compared to the prior year 
utmd groups its sales into four product line categories obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician safety  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical uterine disease  including letz  endometrial sampling  diagnostic laparoscopy  and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal care  comprised of devices that provide developmentally friendly care to the most critically ill babies  including gaining vascular access  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  providing protection and assisting in specialized applications  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized components for invasively monitoring blood pressure on a continuous basis with pressure transducer systems  and subcontract molded parts along with other components and products sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four categories  utmd s primary revenue contributors often enjoy a dominant market share and typically have differentiated product features protected by patents 
revenues by product category worldwide obstetrics product sales decreased and represented of total sales in obstetrics sales dollars were  in compared to  in and  in of the decline in total obstetrics sales  was from lower sales of vacuum assisted delivery systems vads 
the lower sales resulted from increased competition  gpo restrictions and lower utilization by us hospital customers 
despite hospital concern  utmd agrees with acog the american college of obstetricians gynecologists that using vads remains the trained physician s best choice in many operative deliveries  and will continue its educational programs regarding appropriate indications and proper use of the procedure 
us sales of intran r plus  the market leading iup catheter  increased 
cheaper priced  less clinically effective products represent significant competition where hospital administrators are constrained by gpo contracts or may not take the total cost of care into consideration  including increased risk of complications and utilization rates 
international obstetrics sales decreased from in to in primarily because of the loss of one european distributor to bankrupcy 
consolidated global gynecology electrosurgery urology product sales increased overall in  and represented of total revenues 
gyn es uro sales dollars were  in compared to  in and  in electrosurgery product sales increased  direct urology product sales increased  oem urology product sales decreased and sales of gynecology tools and instruments  including the endocurette  decreased 
international sales in this category increased 
a number of utmd products in this fragmented category are patented  so sales should continue to grow as physicians learn more about their advantages 
consolidated global neonatal product sales increased  and represented of total sales 
neonatal product sales were  in compared to  in and  in international neonatal product sales increased 
worldwide blood pressure monitoring and accessories bpm sales increased  and represented of total revenues 
sales of bpm and accessories products were  in compared to  in and  in the increase was led by a increase in international sales of bpm products  helped by a weaker us dollar 
domestic oem sales in this category  which includes plastic molded components used in other industries affected by the weak us economy  declined 
looking forward to  utmd expects better sales growth primarily as a result of mandated changes in us hospital group purchasing practices that in recent years increasingly excluded smaller innovative companies from access to clinicians through high compliance contracts that bundled physician preference products with unrelated commodity products 
hospital complied in order to avoid substantial financial penalties from the larger  more diversified medical device companies 
in addition  after the injunction against tyco for its infringing intrauterine pressure catheter  utmd expects hospitals to return to intran plus  the leader in iupc safety and effectiveness 
the combination of these factors leads utmd to project that intran plus demand will lead its sales growth  projected overall to be 
utmd s patent which tyco infringed will expire in the primary negative sales factor is the discontinuance of manufacturing the pulsion international oem picco catheters  which in contributed about in sales 
the adoption of the picco technology in the us has been slower than pulsion had projected 
b gross profit 
utmd s average gross profit margin gpm  the surplus after costs of manufacturing  inspecting  packaging  sterilizing  and shipping products cogs are subtracted from net revenues  was a company record compared to in and in royalties paid to others are also included in cogs 
utmd experienced a decline in sales of lower margin domestic oem products  an increase in sales of higher margin domestic direct ob gyn products  higher production yields  lower depreciation expense on fixed assets  and higher sales without a proportionate increase in overhead costs 
with respect to gross profits in utmd s sales channels  oem sales are sales of utmd products that are marketed by other companies in conjunction with their product offerings  and are not sold under utmd s label 
utmd utilizes oem sales as a means to help maximize utilization of its capabilities established to satisfy its direct sales business 
as a general rule  prices for oem product sales expressed as a multiple of direct variable manufacturing expenses are lower than for direct sales because in the oem and international channels  utmd s business partners incur significant expenses of sales and marketing 
because of utmd s small size and period to period fluctuations in oem business activity  allocations of fixed manufacturing overheads cannot be meaningfully allocated between direct and oem sales 
therefore  utmd does not report gpm by sales channels 
utmd targets an average gpm greater than or equal to  which it believes is necessary to successfully support the significant operating expenses required in a highly complex and competitive marketplace 
management expects to achieve its gpm target again in expected favorable influences include growth in sales volume without a similar increase in manufacturing overhead expenses  a larger percentage of total sales from higher margin products and a continued emphasis on reengineering products and processes to reduce costs 
expected unfavorable influences are continued competitive pressure on pricing and higher wage rates 
c operating profit 
operating profit  or income from operations  is the surplus after operating expenses are subtracted from gross profits 
operating expenses include sales and marketing s m expenses  research and development r d expenses and general and administrative g a expenses 
operating profit increased compared to the prior year 
in  operating profit was  compared to  in and  in utmd s operating profit margin operating profits divided by total sales was also a company record in the operating profit margin was  compared to in and in operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in  from in and in a major portion of the decrease in operating expenses was due to utmd s required gaap adoption of sfas statement no 
 under which the company recognized no goodwill amortization expense gwa in gwa was in both and for comparison  represents of sales 
looking forward to  utmd expects to continue to improve its operating margin  primarily as a result of an increase in sales coupled with an increase in gpm without a corresponding increase in operating expenses 
in  utmd plans to hold operating expenses as a percent of sales consistent with i s m expenses s m expenses are the costs of communicating utmd s differences and product advantages  providing training and other customer service in support of the use of utmd s solutions and processing orders 
because utmd sells internationally through third party distributors  its s m expenses are predominantly needed for us business activity where it sells directly to clinical users 
the largest component of s m expenses is the cost of directly employing representatives that provide coverage across the country 
us gpo contract administration fees are also included in s m expenses 
year s m expenses decreased to  from  in and  in  as utmd continued to improve the productivity of its direct sales force 
as a percent of total sales  s m expenses were in  in and in looking forward  utmd plans higher s m expenses during due to group purchasing organization fees  increased advertising expenses and new marketing initiatives  but intends to manage s m expenses to remain less than of total sales 
ii r d expenses r d expenses include the costs of investigating clinical needs  developing innovative concepts  testing concepts for viability  validating methods of manufacture  completing regulatory documentation and other activities required for design control  responding to customer requests for product enhancements  and assisting manufacturing engineering on an ongoing basis in developing new processes or improving existing processes 
internal r d expenses were in  in and in as a percent of sales  r d expenses were compared to in and in in  the efforts of r d aided utmd s continued gpm improvements 
in addition to new products still being developed  a number of existing products were enhanced or updated  including optimicro tm dissection needles  hemo nate r  endocurette r  deltran r  lumin r  gesco r stopcocks and catheter hubs  and intran r plus 
in  utmd will opportunistically employ r d resources and invest r d expenditures where management anticipates it can get a significant return on its investments with future new product sales 
those expenses are again likely to be in the range of of sales 
iii g a expenses g a expenses include the front office functional costs of executive management  finance and accounting  corporate information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  legal  risk management and protection of intellectual property 
in addition to employing the personnel required to coordinate or manage the preceding functions  g a expenses include outside director costs  outside legal counsel  independent accounting audit fees  k administration  nasdaq exchange fees  write offs of uncollectible receivables  business insurance costs  and corporate contributions to charitable organizations 
as previously noted  prior to  g a expenses also included gwa 
g a expenses were  in   in and  in as a percent of sales  g a expenses were in  in and in all three years included considerable litigation expenses relating to the patent infringement lawsuit with tyco kendallo ltp 
additional litigation expense will be required to respond to the tyco kendallo ltp appeal 
utmd expects g a expenses in will be about of total sales 
d non operating income  non operating expense and ebt 
non operating income includes royalties from licensing utmd s technology to other companies  rent from leasing unutilized property to others  interest earned from investing the company s cash  and gains or losses from the sale of assets offset by non operating expenses like interest expenses and bank fees on the revolving line of credit 
non operating income was in  in and in royalties received were in both and  and in future royalties may vary depending on the success of other companies in selling products licensed by utmd  and the remaining life of the applicable patents 
interest expense associated with the line of credit which reduce non operating income was in  in and in interest costs in were lower compared to and because the only significant borrowing occureed during the last month and a half of the year  and because interest rates were lower 
assuming interest rates remain about the same as current for the year of  and no new borrowing for acquisitions or share repurchases  utmd expects total non operating income to be about lower in than the difference is due to a projected higher average line of credit balance and less rental income 
earnings before income taxes ebt result from adding utmd s non operating income to its operating profits 
ebt were  in   in and  in ebt in increased by million  higher than in  because of higher sales  record gross profit and operating profit margins combined with higher non operating income 
given the projections noted above  including higher sales  improved gross and operating profit margins  offset by lower non operating income  management is targeting about a increase in ebt 
e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes 
net income increased to  in  from  in and  in the growth in net income was greater than ebt growth because utmd s effective tax rate was lower than in the effective income tax rate in was compared to in and in year to year fluctuations in the tax rate have resulted from the use of a foreign sales corporation  amount of exercised employee options which result in a tax benefit to the company  differences in distribution of state income taxes  differences in profits of the ireland subsidiary which is taxed at a rate on exported manufactured products  and other factors such as r d tax credits and the timing of actual versus accrued litigation expense 
the most important factor in the tax rate decrease in was a tax credit from exercise of employee stock options 
the company eliminated its foreign sales corporation in looking forward  marginal tax rates increase by for ebt above million 
utmd expects its income tax rate to be higher than in  particularly if it receives a large damages award in the tyco kendallo ltp patent infringement lawsuit 
utmd s net income expressed as a percentage of sales ranks in the top performance tier of all us publicly traded companies at  and for years  and  respectively 
this profitability performance factor is the primary driver for utmd s return on shareholders equity roe 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take effect for stock options awarded which have exercise prices below the period s weighted average market value 
diluted eps were  up from in in  eps were 
with sales about the same as the combination of higher profitability and fewer outstanding shares have accounted for the substantial increase in eps since utmd management believes shareholder value is improved primarily by consistently increasing eps 
in the last five year period since  utmd has increased eps at an annually compounded rate of per year 
the end of weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps were  in thousands compared to  shares in and  shares in dilution for options for the year was in thousands shares compared to in  and in the number of unexercised options outstanding was about the same in all three years 
the small increase in dilution was due to a higher share price in the stock market 
actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  in thousands 
return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd to internally finance its growth  divided by the average accumulated shareholders equity during the period 
roe in was compared to in  and in this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without adding external financing that would dilute shareholder interests 
for example  a roe will financially support growth in revenues without issuing more stock 
record profitability  higher utilization of assets  and increased financial leverage all contributed to an outstanding roe result 
in utmd s opinion  achieving growth in revenues and eps without diluting shareholder interests maximizes shareholders value 
management s goal is to consistently achieve roe in excess of 
utmd s roe has averaged per year over the last years 
although the accumulation of cash in the absence of share repurchases or acquisitions could reduce total asset turns  and the elimination of long term debt would reduce financial leverage that enhances roe  management expects to be able to achieve its roe objective again in primarily by accomplishing another record year in profitability 
liquidity and capital resources 
a cash flows 
cash and equivalent balances were at the end of utmd effectively maintains zero balance sweep cash account balances that minimize the line of credit balance  except for operating balances needed to meet requirements in ireland and separate physical reserves set aside for contractual commitments 
net cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital  totaled  in compared to  in and  in the reason that cash provided by operating activities did not increase by as much as net income was that a substantial part of the increase in income was due to lower non cash depreciation and amortization expense  as previously noted 
net cash in was also aided by the tax benefit attributable to exercise of employee options 
for net cash used in investing activities  the company expended and during and  respectively  for puchases of property and equipment  comprised of normal replacement molds and other equipment to sustain manufacturing capabilities 
management believes that investing activities of in will continue to sustain effective manufacturing capabilities and facilities in good condition 
in  the expended for investing activities included for the purchase of certain technology rights 
in  utmd received  from issuing  shares of stock upon the exercise of employee stock options and repurchased  shares of stock in the open market at a cost of  in addition  the company received and retired  shares as the result of employees trading utmd shares in payment for the exercise of stock options  at a cost of option exercises in were at an average price of per share 
share repurchases in the open market were at an average cost of per share  including commissions and costs of the tender offer 
in  the company received from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee stock options about less than in and paid to repurchase  shares about  less than in 
in  the company received from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee stock options and paid  to repurchase  shares of stock in the open market 
in  the company completed a tender offer for its stock similar in dollar magnitude to during  utmd made repayments of  on its note payable  which was the remaining balance at the end of  while receiving  in proceeds from the note line of credit to finance the new tender offer in november the company repurchased  shares in the tender offer at a total cost of  in  utmd made loan repayments of  and received in proceeds from the note 
in  utmd made loan repayments of  and received  in proceeds from the note to help finance a tender offer in september management believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance growth plans and repay debt 
planned capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of to keep facilities  equipment and tooling in good working order 
in addition to the capital expenditures  utmd plans to use cash in for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights to broaden the company s product offerings  for continued share repurchases if the price of the stock remains undervalued  and if available for a reasonable price  acquisitions that strategically fit utmd s business and are accretive to performance 
utmd plans to use any cash not needed for the above pursuits during to eliminate the line of credit balance 
the revolving credit line will continue to be used for liquidity when the timing of acquisitions or repurchases of stock require a large amount of cash in a short period of time 
other financial measures ebitda equals ebt  plus depreciation and amortization expenses  plus interest expense is a term used for measuring a company s ability to generate cash from its operations without regard for changes in working capital  cash consumed for fixed asset purchases  its cost of borrowing or income tax burden 
utmd s ebitda in was million  or as a ratio of sales 
utmd s ebitda has averaged of sales over the last five years 
the extraordinarily strong cash generation performance resulted from a combination of outstanding operating profit performance and royalty income from others use of utmd s technology 
with an increase in sales of  management projects performance factors will remain intact for that will allow ebitda approaching million 
please note that ebitda is not defined or described by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as such  it is not prepared in accordance with gaap  is not a measure of liquidity  and is not a measure of operating results 
however  the components of ebitda are prepared in accordance with gaap  and utmd believes that ebitda is an important measure of the company s operating performance and financial well being 
management s outlook 
in summary  in utmd plans to realize improved results from initiatives to expand sales activity  continue outstanding operating performance  and set new company records for profitability as a percent of sales  sustain the patent infringement verdict and recover damages  and actively look for new acquisitions to build a platform for continued growth 
the following factors provide optimism that will demonstrate better top line growth the new codes of conduct adopted by hospital group purchasing organizations gpos at the direction of the us senate judiciary subcommittee on antitrust  business rights and competition in mid represent a sea change for small  innovative medical device firms that market differentiated products to hospital clinicians  if the new codes are honored by hospital members 
continuing the inquiry into the role of gpos and monitoring compliance with the reforms remains on the top of the subcommittee s agenda according to a february  joint press release from senators mike dewine r oh and herb kohl d wi in an important bipartisan effort to improve the quality and cost of healthcare 
utmd recently completed formal supply agreements with two major gpo s premier  for utmd s l d specialty products  and medassets  for all of utmd s specialty mother and baby products including l d  nicu and gynecology urology products 
a number of other gpo s  perhaps spurred by the new codes of conduct or the injunction against tyco for its infringing iupc  have recently requested contract proposals from utmd 
this is a change from the past 
utmd s electrosurgery gynecology urology products which have not been as constrained by hospital gpo contracts continue to gain acceptance and demonstrate good sales growth 
international demand should continue strong in with a continuing weaker usd  despite the loss of the pulsion picco catheter business 
utmd expects some improvement in us oem activity after a soft year in of course  utmd is gratified with the january jury verdict and subsequent september us district court judgment for about million in damages and interest and permanent injunction of softrans  tyco kendallo ltp s infringing product 
utmd believes the tyco kendallo ltp appeal will be resolved in because of the complexity of patent law  utmd cannot predict the outcome of the appeal 
given the uncertainty  utmd will reserve its projection of the impact that an ultimate victory would have on its business until the case is finally closed 
the appeal process does not require new discovery or new testimony by witnesses 
utmd will continue to focus on differentiating itself  especially from commodity oriented competitors 
utmd is small  but its employees are experienced and diligent in their work 
our passion is in providing innovative clinical solutions that will help reduce health risks for women and their babies 
the company has a defined focus  and does not seek to become big as a primary motivation 
we just want to do an excellent job in meeting our customers needs  and provide our shareholders with excellent returns 
the reliability and performance of utmd s products is high and represents significant clinical benefits as well as minimal total cost of care 
physicians do care about the well being of their patients  but their time is limited to evaluate choices  and they have hospital administrators to deal with who often look at the initial price of a product  period 
utmd is hopeful that recent federal congressional attention on the activities of gpo s will continue to shine a brighter light on anti competitive practices that are not in the best interest of us patients or their physicians 
in the us  utmd will continue to leverage its reputation as an innovator which will responsively take on challenges to work with physicians who use its products in specialty hospital areas  or outside the hospital in their office practices 
internationally  where utmd must depend on the knowledge  focus  relationships and energy of independent distributors  management will continue to closely monitor performance and recruit needed new business partners 
in  utmd expects its ireland subsidiary  which grew its shipments in us dollar terms by in  to continue to improve its contribution to overall performance 
in  utmd again demonstrated a high positive cash flow reflected by achieving record ebitda performance of of sales  managing working capital effectively and keeping new capital expenditures below its rate of depreciation of existing assets 
utmd s balance sheet is strong enough to finance an acquisition in through debt  which is preferred because it doesn t dilute shareholders interest by issuing more stock 
in considering acquisitions  utmd looks to acquire successful companies that will enhance its specialist focus 
when utmd acquires a company  it probably will be for cash  and with the idea that utmd will be able to retain key resources that helped make it successful 
because current market values seem closer to acquisition values that will allow realistic accretive results  utmd intends to increase its acquisition search activity in utmd s technologies are current  and ideas often leading  but we believe in the old fashioned approach of building a long term stable business that will achieve predictable future results allowing job security for our employees who are diligent in their work  consistent returns for our shareholders and continued reliable services for customers who depend on us 
rather than devoting limited resources to a large public relations effort promoting the company s stock  we focus our resources on company business 
over the last five years  utmd has achieved some significant accomplishments compounded eps growth of per year  repurchase of of the ownership of the company including all option exercises for million million net shares at an average cost of per share including commissions  other repurchase costs and the difference between option exercise price and market price for shares exercised  two acquisitions costing million which accounted for of total sales in  and  an apparent successful effort defending the patent rights of utmd s flagship product technology and core franchise of utmd s market identity  plus a million award 
looking back  utmd s eps were up in  and the ending share price was up relative to the end of the nasdaq composite  s p index and djia were all down   and respectively 
with eps of  utmd s year end price to trailing earnings ratio per was still only  suggesting that a combination of per expansion closer to the market average and continued increase in eps performance could again provide excellent shareholder returns in accounting policy changes 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement requires the classification of gains or losses from the extinguishments of debt to meet the criteria of apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions before they can be classified as extraordinary in the income statement 
as a result  companies that use debt extinguishment as part of their risk management cannot classify the gain or loss from that extinguishment as extraordinary 
the statement also requires sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its financial position or future operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard  which is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   provides new guidance on the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs associated with these activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of the company commits to an exit or disposal plan 
the adoption of sfas no 
by the company is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or future operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for all fiscal years ending after december  sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under sfas no 
from intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
sfas also changes the disclosure requirement of sfas  requiring a more prominent disclosure of the pro forma effect of the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
the adoption of sfas no
