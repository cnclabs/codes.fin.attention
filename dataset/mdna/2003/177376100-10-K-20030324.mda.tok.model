item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  market  license and support access infrastructure software and services that enable effective and efficient enterprise wide deployment and management of applications and information  including those designed for microsoft windows operating systems  for unix operating systems  such as sun solaris  hp ux or ibm aix  or collectively unix operating systems  and for web based information systems 
our largest source of revenue is the metaframe xp tm presentation server products 
our metaframe products  which we began shipping in the second quarter of  permit organizations to provide access to windows based  web based  and unix applications without regard to location  network connection or type of client hardware platforms 
we market and license our products through multiple channels such as value added resellers  distributors  system integrators and independent software vendors  managed by our worldwide sales force 
we also promote our products through relationships with a wide variety of industry participants  including microsoft corporation 
in may  we entered into a five year joint license  development and marketing agreement with microsoft  which expired in may under that agreement  or the microsoft development agreement  we licensed our multi user windows nt extensions to microsoft for inclusion in certain versions of its windows nt server software 
we recognized revenue from the microsoft development agreement ratably over the five year term of the contract in other revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
in may  we signed an agreement with microsoft to formalize continued access to microsoft windows server source code 
under this agreement  we will have access to source code for current and future microsoft server operating systems from windows server and beyond  including access to terminal services source code  during the three year term of the agreement 
this agreement does not provide for payments to or from microsoft 
acquisitions we have acquired technology related to our strategic objectives 
in april  we acquired sequoia software corporation for million in cash 
sequoia provided xml based portal software 
the sequoia technology is a core component of our metaframe secure access manager software that was launched in june as nfuse elite 
in february  we acquired all of the operating assets of innovex group  inc for approximately million 
on the date of the acquisition  we paid approximately million in cash  including closing costs 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we were required to pay the remaining purchase price  plus interest  if certain events occurred 
during  these events occurred and  as a result  we paid the remaining purchase price and the associated interest of million in cash in august and million in cash in february we have no remaining contingent obligations 
we accounted for these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for business combinations 
we allocated the cost of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
except for the innovex acquisition  a portion of the acquired intangible assets were related to research and development that had not reached technological feasibility and for which there was no alternative future use 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various 
table of contents other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
cash equivalents and investments 
the fair value of certain of our cash equivalents and investments is dependent on the performance of the companies or funds in which we invest  including equity investments that are accounted for under the cost method due to the limited extent of our ownership interest and lack of our ability to exert significant influence  and the volatility inherent in these investment markets 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our investments to determine if there has been any impairment of value that is other than temporary  which would require us to write down the investments 
in assessing potential impairment  we consider the extent to which recorded costs exceed market values  the duration of any decline in market values and the forecasted financial performance of the issuers 
during the year ended december   we recorded million and during the year ended december   we recorded million of write downs resulting from other than temporary declines in fair value of certain of our investments 
at december   we had million in remaining equity investments classified as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet 
for further information regarding risks related to our cash and investments balances  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to our consolidated financial statements 
we rely on third party valuations in order to adjust the carrying value of certain of our investments and derivative instruments to fair value at the end of each period 
fair values are based on valuation models that use market quotes and  for certain investments  assumptions as to the creditworthiness of the entities issuing those underlying investments 
at december   approximately million in investment securities were pledged as collateral for specified obligations under our synthetic lease 
in addition  at december   approximately million in investment securities were pledged as collateral for our credit default contracts 
we maintain the ability to manage the composition of the pledged investments and accordingly  these securities are not reflected as restricted investments in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
for further information see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
provision for doubtful accounts receivable 
our judgment is required in the assessment of the collectibility of our customer accounts and other receivables 
we provide for potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on an evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
if market conditions decline  or if the financial condition of our customers or distributors deteriorates  actual collection experience may not meet our prior expectations and could result in increased bad debt expenses 
the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million at december  and million at december  the increase during represents reserves based on the financial condition of certain distributors  none of which are individually significant 
in previous years our bad debt write offs have not been significant 

table of contents long lived assets 
the determination of the useful lives of our long lived assets and whether an asset s value is impaired involves significant judgment 
these judgments include  but are not limited to obsolescence  market conditions and contract life 
useful lives of internal use software  property and equipment are generally from three to seven years 
we depreciate buildings over a year period 
we review for impairment of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used whenever we believe that events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not fully recover the carrying amount of such assets 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
we base measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that our management expects to hold and use on the fair value of the asset 
we report long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value minus the costs to sell such assets 
during  we recognized million in asset impairment charges primarily due to the consolidation of certain of our offices that resulted in the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements 
as of december   we have determined that there were no other triggering events requiring additional impairment analysis 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
our adoption of these policies did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
core and product technology assets 
we review acquired core and product technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology 
the core and product technology assets acquired in our sequoia acquisition form the basis for our metaframe secure access manager product  launched in june as nfuse elite 
the recoverability of this technology is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize these products 
the estimated net realizable value of the purchased sequoia technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with our metaframe secure access manager 
our revenues are forecasted based on data received from pilot evaluations and early adopters  rate projections on our installed customer base  and estimates from our sales channels and end customer sales force 
our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of metaframe secure access manager 
due to the lack of historical data related to metaframe secure access manager  actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts 
as of december   we estimated that the net realizable value of these core and product technology assets is greater than the million unamortized cost of these assets 
if these products are not ultimately accepted by our channel or entities with which we have technology relationships or customers  and there is no alternative future use for this technology  we could determine that some or all of the remaining million carrying value of the related core and product technology assets are impaired 
in the event of impairment  we could be required to incur a charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
goodwill and other intangibles 
at december   we had million in indefinite lived goodwill and other intangibles primarily related to our acquisition of sequoia 
we operate in a single market consisting of the design  development  marketing and support of access infrastructure software and services for enterprise applications 
our revenues are derived from sales in the americas  europe  the middle east and africa  or emea  and asia pacific regions 
these three geographic regions constitute our reportable segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our geographic segments 
we evaluate goodwill along these geographic segments 
substantially all of our goodwill at december  was associated with our americas reportable segment 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 our goodwill and certain intangible assets are no longer amortized but are subject to an annual impairment test 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill with a net book 
table of contents value at january  of million  including million of acquired workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets 
excluding goodwill  we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value 
fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
as of december   we concluded that we could realize our goodwill and other intangibles based upon projected discounted cash flows 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill and other intangible assets could change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
current and deferred tax assets 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we determined the million carrying value of our net deferred tax assets based upon certain estimates and assumptions  including the assumption that we will be able to generate enough future tax deductions in certain tax jurisdictions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expenses 
revenue recognition 
the accounting related to revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
in addition  our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
we market and license software products through value added resellers  channel distributors  system integrators and independent software vendors  managed by our worldwide sales force 
our software licenses are generally perpetual  and are delivered by means of traditional packaged products and electronically  typically under volume based licensing programs 
our packaged products are typically purchased by medium and small sized businesses with fewer locations and the software license is delivered with the packaged product 
volume based license arrangements are used with more complex multi server environments typically found in larger business enterprises that deploy our products on a department or enterprise wide basis  which could require differences in product features and functionality at various customer locations 
the end customer license agreement with enterprise customers is typically customized based on these factors 
once we receive a purchase order from the channel distributor  the volume based licenses are electronically delivered to the customer with software activation keys that enable the feature configuration ordered by the end customer 
depending on the size of the enterprise  software may be delivered indirectly by the channel distributor or directly by us pursuant to a purchase order from the channel distributor 
we recognize revenue when it is earned 
our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop  as amended by sop and sop and related interpretations  software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and we have no remaining obligations  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we define these four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists 
we recognize revenue on packaged product upon shipment to distributors and resellers 
for packaged product sales  it is our customary practice to require a purchase order from distributors who have previously negotiated a master packaged product distribution or resale agreement 
for volume based licensing  we typically require a purchase order from the distributor or reseller and an executed standard software license agreement from the end customer 
we require a purchase order for training and services 

table of contents delivery has occurred and we have no remaining obligations 
our standard delivery method is free on board shipping point 
consequently  we consider delivery of our packaged product to have occurred when the products are shipped to distributors pursuant to an agreement and purchase order 
we consider delivery of licenses under electronic licensing agreements to have occurred when the related products are shipped and the end customer has been electronically provided with the licenses that include the activation keys that allow the end customer to take immediate possession of the software 
for training and service revenue recognition  we fulfill our obligation when the services are performed 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
in the normal course of business  we do not provide end customers the right to a refund of any portion of their license fees or extended payment terms 
when we sell our software products separately  we determine vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  by the price charged for each product 
in software arrangements that include the rights to multiple software products  post contract customer support  or pcs  and or other services  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each of the deliverables based on vsoe 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on vsoe  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered  all services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
collectibility is probable 
we determine collectibility on a customer by customer basis 
we typically sell to distributors or resellers for whom there are histories of successful collection 
new customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
customers are subject to an ongoing credit review process 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable  we defer revenue recognition until customer payment is received and the other parameters of revenue recognition described above have been achieved 
our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical experience and economic market conditions 
if market conditions decline  or  if the financial condition of our distributors or end customers deteriorates  we may be unable to determine that collectibility is probable  and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenues until we receive customer payment 
for certain software products that are only sold bundled with pcs  we allocate revenue to the delivered software product using the residual method 
under the residual method  we do not sell the software products separately and thus we are generally unable to determine vsoe of fair value for the product 
therefore  we allocate discounts inherent in the arrangement entirely to the software product and the portion of the fee initially allocated to pcs and deferred is generally higher than in arrangements with established vsoe for the software product 
depending on future product releases or changes in customer demand  we may offer additional products that are only sold bundled with pcs 
if we do this  the use of the residual method will become more prevalent  which could impact the timing of our revenue recognition since more of the sales proceeds would be allocated to the pcs portion of the arrangement and recognized over the pcs period 
we also sell pcs separately through our citrix subscription advantage renewal program  and we determine vsoe by the renewal price charged 
we base technical service and pcs revenues from customer maintenance fees for ongoing customer support and product updates and upgrades on the price charged or derived value of the undelivered elements and are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically to months 
we include technical service revenues in net revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
in the normal course of business  we do not permit product returns  but we do provide most of our distributors and value added resellers with stock balancing and price protection rights 
stock balancing rights permit distributors to return products to us  subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our products 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if we lower our prices for such products 
we establish provisions for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection rights  as well as other sales allowances  concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
the provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including  among other things  historical return rates for both specific products and distributors  estimated distributor inventory levels by product  the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions 
actual product returns for stock balancing and price protection provisions incurred are  however  
table of contents dependent upon future events  including the amount of stock balancing activity by our distributors and the level of distributor inventories at the time of any price adjustments 
we continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and distributor inventory levels and makes adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual returns and other allowances could differ from established reserves 
our ability to recognize revenues upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate future product returns and rotation 
if actual return experience or changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate returns and rotation  we would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end user customer 
allowances for estimated product returns amounted to approximately million at december  and million at december  we have not reduced and have no current plans to reduce our prices for inventory currently held by distributors or resellers 
accordingly  there were no reserves required for price protection at december  or we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  we could take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings and possibly result in an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  defines a fair value method of accounting for issuance of stock options and other equity instruments 
under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
pursuant to sfas no 
 companies are not required to adopt the fair value method of accounting for employee stock based transactions 
companies are permitted to account for such transactions under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  but are required to disclose in a note to the consolidated financial statements pro forma net income and per share amounts as if a company had applied the methods prescribed by sfas no 
we apply apb opinion no 
and related interpretations  which do not require us to recognize compensation cost  in accounting for stock options granted to employees and non employee directors  and we have complied with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
except for non employee directors  we have not granted any options to non employees 
for further information regarding our stock option plans  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion relating to the individual financial statement captions  our overall financial performance  operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with the factors and events described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors which may affect future results which could impact our future performance and financial position 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data and presentation of that data as a percentage of change from period to period 
year ended december  compared to compared to net revenues cost of revenues excluding amortization  presented separately below gross margin operating expenses research and development sales  marketing and support general and administrative amortization of intangible assets in process research and development write down of technology total operating expenses income from operations interest income interest expense other expense  net income before income taxes income taxes net income not meaningful 
net revenues 
our operations consist of the design  development  marketing and support of access infrastructure software and services that enable effective and efficient enterprise wide deployment and management of applications and information 
we present net revenues in the following three categories outlined below license revenue  technical services revenue  and royalty revenue 
license revenue primarily represents fees related to the licensing of our metaframe products  subscription advantage our terminology for pcs  additional user licenses and management products such as load balancing and resource management products 
technical services revenue consists primarily of technical support services  product training and certification  and consulting services related to implementation of our software products 
we recognize technical services and pcs revenues from customer maintenance fees or ongoing customer support ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically to months 
royalty revenue represents the fees recognized in connection with the microsoft development agreement  which expired in may the decrease in net revenues in was due primarily to a decrease in the number of metaframe licenses sold  which resulted from a decrease in packaged product sales due to an overall weakness in information technology spending and a reduction in packaged product inventory held by our distributors 
in the near term  we do not anticipate further material reductions in packaged product inventory held by our distributors 
the decrease in packaged product sales was partially offset by an increase in volume based licensing sales  mainly to medium and large customers 
in addition  the decrease in net revenue also resulted 
table of contents from a significant decline in royalty revenue due to the expiration of the microsoft development agreement in may the increase in net revenues in was primarily attributable to an increase in license revenue resulting from an increase in the number of metaframe licenses sold for windows operating systems  specifically due to market acceptance of our metaframe xp access infrastructure software introduced in february the increase in net revenues in also resulted from an increase in technical services revenue due primarily to an increase in larger scale volume based licensing arrangements that typically require professional services to ensure successful implementation of our technologies 
deferred revenues as of december  primarily related to citrix subscription advantage and technical services revenues 
excluding those deferred revenues associated with the microsoft development agreement  deferred citrix subscription advantage and technical services revenues increased approximately million as compared to december  this increase was due primarily to increased renewals of citrix subscription advantage 
an analysis of our net revenues is presented below year ended december  revenue revenue growth growth to to license revenue technical services revenue royalty revenue net revenues international and segment revenues 
international revenues sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our net revenues for the year ended december   of our net revenues for the year ended december   and of our net revenues for the year ended december  during  the significant increase in our international revenues as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to a weakness in packaged product sales in the united states and the expiration of the microsoft development agreement in may during  the significant increase in our international revenues as a percentage of net revenues was primarily the result of increased sales and marketing efforts and continued demand for our products in europe and asia  as well as the economic impact of slower information technology spending in the united states during we expect that the difficult economic conditions that existed in will persist in an analysis of our geographic segment net revenue as a percentage of net revenue is presented below year ended december  revenue revenue growth growth to to americas emea asia pacific other consolidated net revenues our americas segment is comprised of the united states  canada and latin america 
defined as europe  middle east and africa 
represents royalty fees in connection with the microsoft development agreement  which expired during may with respect to our geographic segment revenues  the decrease in net revenues during as compared to was due primarily to the factors mentioned above  as well as a decline in packaged product sales in europe 
during  revenues notably increased in our asia pacific segment  particularly due to increased 
table of contents sales in japan  and in our emea segment  particularly due to increased sales in europe 
for additional information on international revenues  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consisted primarily of the cost of royalties  product media and duplication  manuals  packaging materials and shipping expense 
cost of revenues also consisted of compensation and other personnel related costs of providing consulting services 
we expensed all development costs incurred in connection with the microsoft development agreement as incurred in cost of other revenues 
our cost of revenues excludes amortization of core technology  which is shown as a component of amortization expense in our consolidated statements of income 
during  we implemented a new enterprise resource planning system 
as a result of this implementation  we have an enhanced ability to obtain information regarding personnel related costs of providing consulting services revenues 
the decrease in the cost of revenues for as compared to  is primarily attributable to our ability to identify certain non revenue generating services expenses and classify such costs as operating expenses 
volume based license sales are typically fulfilled with a nominal level of product media and the licenses are delivered electronically 
the cost of fulfilling such sales is less than traditional packaged product sales  thereby reducing costs of revenues as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in cost of revenues for was due to an overall increase in our packaged product sales and increases in compensation and other costs of providing services revenues 
these increases were offset in part by a reduction of the level of inventory necessary to fulfill customer orders due to increased market acceptance of volume based licenses 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percent of revenue was for  for and for the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue from to was primarily due to the decrease in cost of revenues as discussed above 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue from to was primarily due to larger reserves for obsolete inventory recorded in to a lesser extent  the increase in gross margin during was also due to an increase in volume based licensing  as discussed above 
we currently anticipate that in the next months  gross margin as a percentage of net revenues will remain relatively unchanged as compared with current levels 
however  gross margin could fluctuate from time to time based on a number of factors attributable to the cost of revenues as described above 
as further discussed below  during we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately approximately employees and consolidated certain functions from our salt lake city  utah and columbia  maryland facilities into our fort lauderdale  florida facility 
as a result of such actions  we incurred expenses of approximately million  primarily for severance and related facility expenses  of which approximately million were included in research and development expenses  million were included in sales  marketing and support expenses and million were included in general and administrative expenses 
we currently expect that increases in insurance premiums and higher foreign currency expenses  impacted by a weaker dollar exchange rate  and investments in new products  will offset savings from these actions 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs 
we expensed all development costs included in the research and development of software products and enhancements to existing products as incurred except for core technologies acquired 
research and development expenses increased during primarily from an increase in staffing and associated salaries that primarily related to the sequoia acquisition in the second quarter of  additional costs for severance for the worldwide workforce reduction  and relocation and facility related charges associated with the consolidation of our salt lake city  utah and columbia  maryland development teams into our remaining engineering facilities during these increases were partially offset by a reduction in costs for third party software  external consultants and developers and a decrease in personnel costs due to the worldwide workforce reduction 
research and development expenses increased in primarily from additional staffing  associated salaries and related expenses 
the increase in was also due to costs incurred for third party software and 
table of contents external consultants and developers used to expand and enhance our product lines  including feature releases of metaframe and research and development efforts on anticipated future product offerings 
sales  marketing and support expenses 
sales  marketing and support expenses increased during primarily from additional end customer sales personnel hired during and particularly for medium to large customers  an increase in staffing and associated salaries related to the sequoia acquisition during  and severance charges associated with our worldwide workforce reduction 
to a lesser extent  the reallocation of certain non revenue generating services expense from cost of revenues to operating expenses also contributed to the increase 
the increase was partially offset by a reduction in marketing costs due to a refocus in marketing programs spending based on the current operating environment  and the reallocation of certain overhead expenses to other departments  primarily depreciation expense to certain general and administrative cost centers 
sales  marketing and support expenses increased in primarily from increased personnel for sales  services and marketing and associated salaries  commissions and related expenses focused on our sales  consulting and marketing efforts 
included in such marketing efforts in was the expansion of our end customer sales force in connection with marketing to large corporate enterprise accounts 
the increase was also due to a higher level of marketing programs directed at customer and business partner acquisition and retention  and additional promotional activities related to specific products  such as metaframe xp introduced in february general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in primarily from a reallocation of certain overhead expenses from other departments to general and administrative expenses  primarily depreciation expense from certain sales  marketing and support cost centers into certain general and administrative cost centers 
general and administrative expenses increased in primarily from increased staff  associated salaries and related expenses necessary to support overall increases in the scope of our operations 
the increase during also resulted from increased depreciation from our enterprise resource planning system implemented in  as well as the reallocation of certain overhead costs from other departments into certain general and administrative cost centers and an increase in consulting and accounting fees 
amortization of intangible assets 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the new rules  we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives but subject them to an annual impairment test 
at the date of adoption  we had unamortized goodwill  including acquired workforce  in the amount of million  which is no longer amortized 
the decrease in amortization of intangible assets during was substantially due to the adoption of sfas no 
other intangibles of million at january  continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
as of december   we had unamortized identified intangible assets with estimable useful lives in the net amount of million 
we recorded million during and million  during in amortization expense 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we completed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at the date of adoption and again during the fourth quarter of there were no impairment charges recorded as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
or impairment tests 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors which may affect future results 
the increase in amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in was primarily due to our acquisition of sequoia in april this acquisition resulted in additional goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of approximately million at the date of acquisition 
additionally  for  the increase was also due to additional goodwill of approximately million associated with contingent purchase price payments related to the acquisition of innovex 
in process research and development 
in april  we acquired sequoia  of which million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development  or ipr d 
the amounts allocated to 
table of contents ipr d had not yet reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use and were written off at the time of the acquisition 
there were no write offs of ipr d during write down of technology 
we periodically review our finite lived intangible assets to determine if any impairment exists 
in june  we completed the acquisition of apm ltd  or apm 
the acquired core technology consisted primarily of a java software product that would operate in a metaframe server environment 
at the time of the acquisition  we anticipated that there would be a growing demand for java client applications 
after the acquisition  the market did not develop as we originally anticipated 
in the second quarter of  we changed the java application server product to a java performance pack product  which adds performance enhancements and management tools to our other products 
by the fourth quarter of  we had developed a java performance pack and had assessed the market demand for this technology 
as of december   we did not believe that there were sufficient projected cash flows to support the net book value of the core technology associated with the apm acquisition 
in addition  we determined that there was no alternative future use for the acquired technology 
as a result  we recorded a write down of million  representing the net book value of the apm core technology as of december  in july  we completed the acquisition of vdonet corporation ltd  or vdonet 
the acquired core technology consisted primarily of the ica video services project  which allowed video applications and applications containing videos to be viewed on an ica client 
subsequent development efforts resulted in the videoframe product  which shipped in the third quarter of  but resulted in few sales to end customers 
after the acquisition  we explored alternative uses for the acquired technology 
by the third quarter of  we had explored uses related primarily to delivering video applications in a server based computing environment and video streaming with ica devices 
in the fourth quarter of  we reviewed potential modifications to our cash flow projections based on identified alternative uses for the technology 
as a result of our evaluation  we did not believe that there were sufficient projected cash flows to support the carrying value of the core technology 
as a result  we recorded a write down of million  representing the net book value of the vdonet core technology as of december  interest income 
interest income decreased during primarily due to a decrease in interest rates 
during  we terminated an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million and in december  we sold the investments underlying this swap agreement 
as a result  the decrease in interest income during was partially offset by interest income of approximately million recognized as a result of the termination of this interest rate swap and the hedging relationship 
for more information see liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest income increased in as compared to principally from our decision to change the composition of our investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of from tax exempt and taxable to predominantly taxable securities  partially offset by a decrease in interest rates during interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense for as compared to was due primarily to interest expense incurred during on contingent payments associated with the innovex acquisition 
the increase in interest expense for as compared to was primarily due to interest on contingent payments associated with the innovex acquisition  as well as the accretion of the original issue discount related to the zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures issued in march other expense  net 
other expense  net is primarily comprised of other than temporary declines in the value of our equity investments and realized gains losses on the sale of available for sale investments  as well as  remeasurement and foreign currency transaction gains losses 
the increase in other expense  net for as compared to other expense  net in was the result of million of losses from other than temporary declines in the fair value of certain of our equity investments and realized losses on the sale of available for sale securities  as well as approximately million in remeasurement and foreign currency transaction losses 
the change in other expense  net for as compared to other expense  net for was the result of million of losses recorded in resulting from other than temporary declines in the fair value of certain of our equity investments  as well as approximately million in remeasurement and foreign currency 
table of contents transaction losses partially offset by realized gains of million associated with purchases and sales of available for sale securities and associated contracts 
income taxes 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from in to in was due primarily to the adoption of sfas no 
 pursuant to which amortization of goodwill  which previously increased taxable income in the determination of our effective tax rate  ceased 
the reduction in the tax rate was also due to higher tax credits related to our foreign operations and research and development  and the cessation of revenues from the microsoft development agreement  which expired in may the increase in the effective tax rate from in to in resulted primarily from non deductible goodwill associated with the acquisition of sequoia offset in part by a rate decrease resulting from increased foreign earnings which were taxed at lower foreign tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources during  we generated positive operating cash flows of million 
these cash flows related primarily to net income of million  adjusted for  among other things  tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of million  non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization expenses of million  provisions for product returns of million primarily due to our stock rotation program and the accretion of original issue discount and amortization of financing costs on our convertible subordinated debentures of million 
these cash inflows were partially offset by an aggregate decrease in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of million 
our investing activities provided million of cash consisting primarily of the net proceeds  after reinvestment  from sales and maturities of investments of million  offset by the expenditure of million for the purchase of property and equipment and net cash paid for acquisitions a contingent payment resulting from the february innovex acquisition of approximately million 
our financing activities used cash of million related primarily to the expenditure of million for the stock and debt repurchase programs  partially offset by the proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans and the sale of put warrants of million

these cash flows related primarily to net income of million  adjusted for  among other things  tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of million  non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization expenses of million  provisions for product returns of million primarily due to our stock rotation program and the accretion of original issue discount and amortization of financing costs on our convertible subordinated debentures of million 
these cash inflows were partially offset by an aggregate decrease in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of million 
our investing activities used million of cash consisting primarily of net cash paid for acquisitions primarily in connection with the acquisition of sequoia of million  the net purchase of investments of million and million for our purchase of property and equipment and costs associated with our enterprise resource planning  or erp  system implementation 
approximately million was capitalized through december   related to our erp system 
we used million in cash in financing activities related primarily to our expenditure of million for stock repurchase programs  partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock compensation plans of million and million generated from premiums received upon the sale of put warrants 
cash and investments as of december   we had million in cash and investments  including million in cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  we had million in working capital at december  the million decrease in cash and investments as compared to december   is due primarily to continued common stock and debt repurchases  capital expenditures and a contingent acquisition payment as discussed above  partially offset by positive cash flow from operations 
we generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade  highly liquid securities to allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash 
table of contents needs 
our short and long term investments  other than million of equity investments  consist of interest bearing securities 
in december  we invested million in a trust managed by an investment advisor 
the purpose of the trust is to maintain sufficient liquidity in the event that our debentures are redeemed in march our investment in the trust matures on march   and comprises all of the trust s assets 
the trust s assets primarily consist of aaa rated zero coupon corporate securities 
the trust entered into a credit risk swap agreement with the investment advisor  which effectively increased the yield on the trust s assets and for which value the trust assumed the credit risk of ten investment grade companies 
the effective yield of the trust  including the credit risk swap agreement  is and the principal balance will accrete to million in march therefore  beginning with the quarter ending march   we will classify the investment as a short term investment in our consolidated balance sheet to reflect the amount that will be due within one year of the balance sheet date 
we record our investment in the trust and the underlying investments and swap as held to maturity zero coupon corporate security in our consolidated financial statements 
we do not recognize changes in the fair value of the held to maturity investment unless a decline in the fair value of the trust is other than temporary  in which case we would recognize a loss in earnings 
our investment is at risk to the extent that one of the underlying corporate securities has a credit event resulting in non payment to the counterparty that may include bankruptcy  dissolution  or insolvency of the issuers 
there have been no losses associated with the trust s underlying corporate securities to date 
the amortized cost of our investment in the trust was approximately million at december  and million at december   which we classified as long term corporate investments in our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the fair value of the trust s assets was million 
in addition  we have invested in other instruments with similar credit risk features 
this means that these investments are at risk to the extent that the entities issuing the underlying corporate securities have credit events above specified amounts that result in a loss to the counterparty 
there have been no credit events associated with the entities issuing the underlying corporate securities to date 
for more information see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of approximately million 
the interest rate swap agreement effectively converted a like amount of floating rate notes in our investment portfolio to a synthetic zero coupon investment due in march with a maturity value of approximately million 
in october  we terminated this interest rate swap agreement 
upon termination  we received a cash payment of million as settlement under the swap agreement  and gained approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of taxes 
we previously accounted for the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
during december  certain investments underlying the swap were sold  and hedge accounting was terminated and the associated other comprehensive income was recognized through earnings 
accounts receivable  net at december   we had approximately million in accounts receivable  net of allowances 
the modest increase in accounts receivable as compared to is primarily attributed to an increase in sales in the asia pacific region for the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  partially offset by an increase in worldwide allowances 
from time to time  we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances from our distributors or customers  which are comprised of large business enterprises  governments and small and medium sized businesses 
if the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorates  our operating results could be adversely affected 
one such distributor accounted for approximately of gross accounts receivable as of december  in  this distributor accounted for of gross accounts receivable 
during these periods  no other distributor or customer accounted for more than of accounts receivable 

table of contents convertible subordinated debentures in march  we sold million principal amount at maturity of our zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due in march  in a private placement 
the debentures were priced with a yield to maturity of 
our net proceeds were approximately million  net of original issue discount and net of debt issuance costs of million 
except under limited circumstances  we will pay no interest prior to maturity 
the security holders can convert the debentures at any time on or before the maturity date at a conversion rate of shares of our common stock for each  principal amount at maturity of the debentures  subject to adjustment in certain events 
we can redeem the debentures on or after march   and the holders of the debentures can require us to repurchase the debentures on fixed dates and at set redemption prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount beginning on march  accordingly  beginning with the quarter ended march   we will classify the debentures as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect the amount that will be payable on demand within one year of the balance sheet date 
we will maintain sufficient liquidity in the event that holders of the debentures require us to redeem or we elect to repurchase the debentures 
in october  our board of directors approved a program authorizing us to spend up to million to repurchase debentures in open market purchases 
additionally  in april our board of directors granted us the additional authority to repurchase up to million in debentures through private transactions  bringing our total repurchase authority up to million 
as of december   we have repurchased  units for approximately million  which represents million in principal amount at maturity 
during  we adopted sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections earlier than required  and therefore we recorded an operating gain of approximately million during as a result of our debenture repurchases 
the board of directors limited authorization to repurchase the debentures allows us to repurchase debentures when market conditions are favorable 
in december  we invested million in investments accounted for as held to maturity corporate securities to maintain sufficient liquidity in the event that our debentures are redeemed in march based on the million expected maturity value of the investments in march  the proceeds of the investments will be sufficient to fund the redemption of approximately of the debentures  if required 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash and investments to fund the redemption of the remaining debentures in  if required 
stock repurchase program our board of directors has authorized million of repurchase authority under our stock repurchase program  in order to manage actual and anticipated dilution 
we record all repurchased shares as treasury stock 
we are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds 
during  we purchased  shares of outstanding common stock on the open market for approximately million at an average per share price of 
from time to time  we enter into arrangements with financial institutions as part of our share repurchase program in order to lower our average cost to acquire shares 
these arrangements are described below 
we were party to two agreements  executed during and  with a large financial institution  to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at various times in private transactions 
under the terms of the agreements  we paid this institution an aggregate of million  with the ultimate number of shares repurchased dependent on market conditions 
in may  the agreements were terminated and  upon termination  we received million of the remaining shares 
we received a total of  shares pursuant to these agreements 
during  we entered into a new agreement  as amended  with this financial institution in a private transaction to purchase up to million shares of our common stock at various times through february pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we paid million to this institution during the third quarter of during  we received  shares under this agreement with a total value of 
table of contents million 
the agreement matured in february and we received  of the remaining shares with a total value of million 
during  we entered into two private structured stock repurchase transactions with a large financial institution 
under the terms of the first agreement and in exchange for an up front payment of million  we were entitled to receive shares of our common stock or a predetermined cash amount at the expiration of the agreement dependent upon the closing price of our common stock at maturity 
upon expiration of the agreement in december  we received approximately million in cash 
under the terms of the second agreement and in exchange for an up front payment of million  we are entitled to receive approximately million shares of our common stock or a predetermined cash amount at expiration of the agreement in march the form of settlement at maturity of the second transaction will be dependent upon the closing market price of our common stock 
we sell put warrants that entitle the holder of each warrant to sell to us  generally by physical delivery  one share of our common stock at a specified price 
during  we sold  put warrants at an average strike price of and received premium proceeds of million 
during  we paid million for the purchase of  shares upon the exercise of outstanding put warrants  and  put warrants expired unexercised 
as of december    put warrants with exercise prices ranging from to were outstanding  and expired on various dates between january and march as of december   we had a total potential repurchase obligation of approximately million associated with the outstanding put warrants  of which million is classified as a put warrant obligation on our consolidated balance sheet 
the remaining million of outstanding put warrants permit a net share settlement at our option and are not recorded as a put warrant obligation in our consolidated balance sheet 
the outstanding put warrants classified as a put warrant obligation in our consolidated balance sheet will be reclassified to stockholders equity when the warrant is exercised or when it expires 
under the terms of the put warrant agreements  we must maintain certain levels of cash and investment balances 
as of december   we were in compliance with those required levels 
in december  we entered into an agreement with a counterparty  which required that the counterparty sell to us up to  shares of our common stock at fixed prices if our common stock trades at designated levels between december  and january  as of december   we had a potential remaining repurchase obligation associated with this agreement of approximately million  which is classified as common stock subject to repurchase in our consolidated balance sheet 
during january  this agreement expired and no shares were repurchased 
we expended an aggregate of million during and million during  net of premiums received under all stock repurchase transactions 
since inception of our stock repurchase programs  the average cost of shares acquired was per share compared to an average close price during open trading windows of per share 
due to the fact that the amount of certain shares received will not be determined until contract maturity  these per share amounts exclude up front payments under structured stock repurchase contracts that had a maturity subsequent to december  commitments in april  we entered into a synthetic lease with a substantive lessor totaling approximately million for our corporate headquarters office space in fort lauderdale  florida 
the synthetic lease represents a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party lessor funded of the costs of acquiring the property and leases the asset to us 
the synthetic lease qualifies as an operating lease for accounting purposes and as a financing lease for tax purposes 
we do not include the property or the lease debt as an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
consequently  we include payments made pursuant to the lease as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we entered into the synthetic lease in order to lease our headquarters properties under more favorable terms than under our previous lease arrangements 
the initial term of the synthetic lease is seven years 
upon approval by the lessor  we can renew the lease twice for additional two year periods 
the lease payments vary based on the london interbank offered rate  
table of contents or libor  plus a margin 
at any time during the lease term  we have the option to sublease the property  and upon thirty days written notice  we have the option to purchase the property for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees of approximately million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed 
upon at least days notice prior to the termination of the initial lease term  we have the option to remarket the property for sale to a third party 
if we choose not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term  we have guaranteed a residual value to the lessor of approximately million and possession of the buildings will be returned to the lessor 
if the fair value of the building were to decline below million  we would have to make up the difference under our residual value guarantee  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the synthetic lease includes certain financial covenants including a requirement for us to maintain a pledged balance of approximately million in cash and or investment securities as collateral 
we manage the composition of the pledged investments and investment earnings are available for operating purposes 
additionally  we must maintain a minimum cash and investment balance of million  excluding our debentures  collateralized investments and equity investments  as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and investments in excess of those required levels 
the synthetic lease includes non financial covenants including the maintenance of the properties and adequate insurance  prompt delivery of financial statements to the lender of the lessor and prompt payment of taxes associated with the properties 
as of december  we were in compliance with all material provisions of the arrangement 
estimated future payments due under this lease are million for  million for  million for  for million and million for estimated lease payments thereafter total million 
we have subleased to other entities some of our leased real property under the synthetic lease 
we lease a significant portion of our worldwide facilities under non cancelable operating leases 
future payments due under these non cancelable operating leases are million for the year ending december   million for the year ending december   million for the year ending december   million for the year ending december  and million for the year ending december  thereafter  payments due total million 
capital expenditures were million during  million during and million during during  capital expenditures were primarily related to leasehold improvements on newly occupied buildings 
the decrease  as compared to  is due to expenditures in for buildings  land and our erp system 
in the normal course of business  we enter into commitments related to capital expenditures  however  we currently have no material contractual commitments for capital expenditures over the next months 
during and  we took actions to consolidate certain of our offices  including the exit of certain leased office space and the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements 
lease obligations related to these existing operating leases continue to october with a total remaining obligation of approximately million  of which million  net of anticipated sublease income  was accrued for as of december   and is reflected in accrued expenses in our consolidated financial statements 
in calculating this accrual  we made estimates  based on market information  including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and opportunities 
if actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than management has estimated  the total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher 
during and  significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by operations 
although we believe existing cash and investments together with cash flow expected from operations will be sufficient to meet operating and capital expenditures requirements for the next months  future operating results and expected cash flow from operations could vary if we experience a decrease in customer demand or a decrease in customer acceptance of future product offerings 
we could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
we continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic objectives 
such 
table of contents investments could reduce our available working capital 
we currently expect that the difficult economic conditions that existed during will persist in certain factors which may affect future results our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and could in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
from time to time  information provided by us or statements made by our employees could contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in this form k  and in the documents incorporated by reference into this form k  that are not historical facts  including  but not limited to statements concerning new products  product development and offerings  product and price competition  deferred revenues  the microsoft source licensing agreement  economic and market conditions  revenue recognition  growth of revenues  product concentration  market competition  marketing efforts  technology relationships  investments in foreign operations and markets  reinvestment of foreign earnings  gross margins  goodwill  intangible assets  impairment charges  accounts receivable  amortization  reserves  in process research and development valuation  foreign currency hedging transactions  interest income  anticipated operating and capital expenditure requirements  reductions in operating expenses  expenses related to workforce reductions  leasing and subleasing activities  acquisitions  debt redemption obligations  stock repurchases  investment transactions  litigation matters  intellectual property matters  including proprietary technology protection  distribution channels  packaged product inventories  stock price  deferred tax assets  licensing models  sales cycles  trading plans and potential debt or equity financings constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are neither promises nor guarantees 
our actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and could in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this form k  in the documents incorporated by reference into this form k or presented elsewhere by our management from time to time 
such factors  among others  could have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if microsoft terminates or fails to renew our license agreement  fails to continue to commercialize windows or designs windows so that it is no longer interoperable with our products  our business could be adversely affected 
microsoft is the leading provider of desktop operating systems 
we depend upon the license of key technology from microsoft  including certain source and object code licenses and technical support 
in may  we signed an agreement with microsoft to formalize continued access to microsoft windows server source code 
under this agreement  we will have access to source code for current and future microsoft server operating systems  including access to terminal services source code  during the three year term of the agreement 
our relationship with microsoft is subject to the following risks and uncertainties  which individually  or in the aggregate  could cause a material adverse effect in our business  results of operations and financial condition dependence on microsoft for commercialization 
our ability to successfully commercialize citrix metaframe access infrastructure depends on microsoft s ability to market windows nt server  terminal server editions and windows servers and the upcoming windows server  or collectively windows server operating systems  products 
we do not have control over microsoft s distributors and resellers and  to our knowledge  microsoft s distributors and resellers are not obligated to purchase products from microsoft 
additionally  there could be delays in the release and shipment of future versions of windows server operating systems 
termination of the microsoft source licensing agreement 
microsoft could terminate the current agreement before the expiration of the three year term for breach and upon our change of control 
if microsoft does terminate the current agreement  our restricted access to source code for current and future microsoft server operating systems could negatively impact our ability to release future products and enhancements 

table of contents interoperability 
future product offerings by microsoft may not provide for interoperability with our products 
the lack of interoperability between present or future microsoft products and our products  could cause a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our agreements with microsoft are short in duration 
there can be no assurances that our current agreements with microsoft will be extended or renewed by microsoft after their respective expirations or that  if renewed such agreements will be on terms favorable to us 
our failure to renew certain terms of these agreements with microsoft could result in an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market in particular 
the demand for our products depends substantially upon the general demand for business related computer hardware and software  which fluctuates based on numerous factors  including capital spending levels  the spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers and general economic conditions 
fluctuations in the demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in  adverse economic conditions decreased demand for our products and negatively impacted our financial results 
if the current trend of decreased and slower informational technology spending continues  it could continue to negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our long sales cycle for enterprise wide sales could make it difficult to predict our quarterly operating results 
in recent quarters  a growing number of our large and medium sized customers have decided to implement our volume based licensing programs on a department or enterprise wide basis 
for convenience  the licenses under these arrangements are electronically delivered to our customers 
our long sales cycle for these large scale deployments makes it difficult to predict when these sales will occur  and we may not be able to sustain these sales on a predictable basis 
for example  our electronically delivered licensing arrangements constituted of our product sales in the year ended december   a portion of which has been deferred 
we have a long sales cycle for these enterprise wide sales because our sales force generally needs to explain and demonstrate the benefits of a large scale deployment of our product to potential and existing customers prior to sale  our service personnel typically spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and evaluation of our product  our customers are typically large and medium size organizations that carefully research their technology needs and the many potential projects prior to making capital expenditures for software infrastructure  and before making a purchase  our potential customers usually must get approvals from various levels of decision makers within their organizations  and this process can be lengthy 
the continued long sales cycle for these large scale deployment sales could make it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales will occur 
delays in sales could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period 
our accounting policies could require us to take an impairment charge to earnings  particularly during difficult economic conditions 
we have adopted accounting policies that could require us to take a charge to earnings related to our sequoia acquisition 
in july  we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  and in january  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill 
table of contents and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
however  we continue to amortize certain product and core technologies  trademarks  patents and other intangibles 
we periodically evaluate our intangible assets  including goodwill  for impairment 
if we determine that any of our intangible assets are impaired  we could be required to take a related charge to earnings 
in particular  at december   we had million  net  of unamortized identified intangibles with estimable useful lives  of which million consists of product and core technology we purchased in the acquisition of sequoia 
we commercialized and currently market the sequoia technology through our secure access infrastructure software  which includes citrix metaframe secure access manager 
however  our channel distributors and entities with which we have technology relationships  customers or prospective customers may not purchase or widely accept our new line of products 
if we are unsuccessful in selling this new line of products  we could determine that the value of the purchased technology is impaired in whole or in part and take a charge to earnings 
an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
if we do not develop new products and enhancements to our existing products  we may not be successful 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  fluctuations in customer demand  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
our future success depends on our ability to continually enhance our current products and develop and introduce new products that our customers choose to buy 
if we are unable to keep pace with technological developments and customer demands by introducing new products and enhancements  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our future success could be hindered by delays in our introduction of new products  delays in market acceptance of new products or new releases of our current products  and our  or a competitor s  announcement of new product enhancements or technologies that could replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing product offerings 
for example  we cannot guarantee that our secure access infrastructure software  citrix metaframe secure access manager  will achieve the broad market acceptance by our channel and entities with which we have a technology relationship  customers and prospective customers necessary to generate significant revenue 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by others 
if we experience material delays or sales shortfalls with respect to our new products or new releases of our current products  those delays or shortfalls could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that we could incur additional costs and royalties as we develop  license or buy new technologies or enhancements to our existing products 
these added costs and royalties could increase our cost of revenues and operating expenses 
however  we cannot currently quantify the costs for such transactions that have not yet occurred 
in addition  we may need to use a substantial portion of our cash and investments to fund these additional costs 
we face intense competition  which could result in fewer customer orders and reduced revenues and margins 
we compete in intensely competitive markets 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources than us 

table of contents microsoft includes its remote desktop protocol  or rdp  as a component in certain windows server operating systems  which has certain of the capabilities of our ica protocol  and offers customers a competitive solution 
further  our ability to market the metaframe product suite  the metaframe secure access manager products and other future product offerings could be affected by microsoft s licensing and pricing scheme for client devices  which attach to windows server operating systems and utilize our products 
moreover  the announcement of the release  and the actual release  of new window based server operating systems or products incorporating similar features to our products could cause our existing and potential customers to postpone or cancel plans to license certain of our existing and future product offerings  which could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
future product offerings by microsoft could be competitive with our current metaframe software suite  and any of our future product offerings 
furthermore  the microsoft development agreement expired in may consequently  microsoft is no longer contractually restricted from changing its windows server operating systems to render them inoperable with our metaframe product offerings 
further  microsoft is no longer restricted from assisting third parties to compete with our metaframe products 
in addition  alternative products for web applications in the internet software market directly and indirectly compete with our current products and anticipated future product offerings 
existing or new products that extend internet software to provide web based information access or interactive computing such as microsoft windows server products can materially impact our ability to sell our products in this market 
our competitors in this market include microsoft  oracle  sun microsystems  and other makers of web application server software 
as the markets for our products continue to develop  additional companies  including companies with significant market presence in the computer hardware  software and networking industries could enter the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition 
in addition  we believe price competition could become a more significant competitive factor in the future 
as a result  we may not be able to maintain our historic prices and margins  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we could change our licensing models or the percentage of our revenue represented by deferred revenues could increase  which could negatively impact our recognition of revenue 
we continually re evaluate our licensing programs  including specific license models  delivery methods  and terms and conditions  to market our current and future products and services 
we could implement new licensing programs  including offering specified and unspecified enhancements to our current and future product and service lines 
for example  on october   we implemented new volume based licensing programs 
we could recognize revenues associated with those enhancements after the initial shipment or licensing of the software product or over the product s life cycle 
we could implement different licensing models in certain circumstances  for which we would recognize licensing fees over a longer period  which could decrease our current revenue 
for example  we recognize citrix subscription advantage and technical services revenues from customer maintenance fees or ongoing customer support ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically to months 
deferred revenues from citrix subscription advantage and technical services increased by approximately million in as compared to the timing of the implementation of new licensing programs  the timing of the release of such enhancements and other factors could impact the timing of our recognition of revenues and related expenses associated with our products  related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
as our international sales and operations grow  we could become increasingly subject to additional risks that could harm our business 
we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states 
for the year ended december   we derived of our revenues from sales outside the united states 
our continued growth and profitability could require us to further expand our international operations 

table of contents to successfully expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  which could cause international revenues to fluctuate 
these risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  including our ability to adequately hedge our foreign exchange risks  compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements  variability of foreign economic  political and labor conditions  changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers or by united states export laws  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriation of earnings  difficulties in protecting intellectual property  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate and address these risks 
we cannot guarantee that these or other factors will not adversely affect our business or operating results 
in particular  a decrease in demand for software and services in any particular region could adversely affect our future operating results 
our results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in the value of foreign currencies in relative to the value of the us dollar were generally hedged to minimize adverse impacts on our operating profit 
however  since we generally hedge only one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses  operations will be impacted adversely in fiscal the us dollar weakened during relative to other currencies 
if the value of the us dollar continues to weaken relative to other currencies in which we do business  our results could be adversely affected in as well when these currencies are remeasured for the purposes of converting them to us dollars for our financial statements 
sales of our metaframe product suite constitutes a substantial majority of our revenue 
we anticipate that sales of our metaframe product suite and related enhancements will constitute a substantial majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our ability to continue to generate revenue from our metaframe product line will depend on market acceptance of windows server operating systems and or unix operating systems 
declines in demand for our metaframe products could occur as a result of new competitive product releases and updates to existing products  price competition  technological change  decreasing or stagnant information technology spending levels  general economic conditions  or lack of success of entities with which we have a technology relationship 
if our customers do not continue to purchase our metaframe products as a result of these or other factors  our revenue would decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our synthetic lease is an off balance sheet arrangement that could negatively affect our financial condition and results 
in april  we entered into a seven year synthetic lease with a substantive lessor for our headquarters office buildings in fort lauderdale  florida 
the synthetic lease qualifies for operating lease accounting 
table of contents treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for leases  so we do not include the property or the lease debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
if new or proposed accounting standards are adopted by accounting standards organizations and governmental authorities  we may be required to include the property and the lease debt in our consolidated financial statements  and as a result we would incur additional depreciation expenses 
under the lease  we must maintain a pledged balance of approximately million in cash and or investment securities with an affiliate of the lessor  serving as collateral agent 
we are able to manage the composition of the pledged investments and investment earnings are available for operating purposes 
if we default on our commitments under the synthetic lease and cannot remedy the default in a timely manner  the lessor could take the pledged assets and transfer ownership of the real estate to us 
we could purchase the property at any time during the lease term  with thirty days written notice  for the original property cost plus transaction fees and lease breakage fees 
if we purchase the property  we will be required to add the property to our consolidated balance sheet 
at any time during the lease term  we could also re lease the property or remarket the property for sale to a third party 
if we remarket the property for sale to a third party  we could be required to find alternate headquarter facilities on terms that may not be as favorable as the current arrangement 
if we elect not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term  we have guaranteed a minimum residual value of approximately million to the lessor 
therefore  if the fair value of the property declines below million  we would have to make up the difference under our residual value guarantee  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for further information on our synthetic lease  please refer to liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements 
our proprietary rights could offer only limited protection 
our products could infringe third party intellectual property rights  which could result in material costs 
our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be successful 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  to protect our proprietary rights 
the loss of any material trade secret  trademark  trade name  patent or copyright could have a material adverse effect on our business 
despite our precautions  it could be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer certain portions of our products or to otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information 
if we cannot protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use  we may not remain competitive 
any patents owned by us could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
any of our pending or future patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged  may not be issued with the scope we seek  if at all  and if issued  may not provide any meaningful protection or competitive advantage 
in addition  our ability to protect our proprietary rights could be affected by differences in international law  enforceability of licenses 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and canada 
for example  we derive a significant portion of our sales from licensing our packaged products under shrink wrap license agreements that are not signed by licensees and electronic volume based licensing agreements that could be unenforceable under the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions 
third party infringement claims 
as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments increases and the functionality of these products overlap  we could become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
companies and inventors are more frequently seeking to patent software and business methods because of developments in the law that could extend the ability to obtain such patents 
as a result  we could receive patent infringement claims 
responding to any infringement claim  regardless of its validity  could result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to intellectual property rights of those third parties 
licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  attention to these claims could divert our management s time and attention from developing our business 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license 
table of contents a substitute technology  our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to risks associated with our technology relationships 
our business depends on technology relationships 
we cannot assure you that those relationships will continue in the future 
in addition to our relationship with microsoft  we rely on technology relationships with ibm  hp  dell and others 
we depend on the entities with which we have technology relationships to successfully test our products  to incorporate our technology into their products and to market and sell those products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current technology relationships or to develop additional technology relationships 
if any entities in which we have a technology relationship are unable to incorporate our technology into their products or to market or sell those products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we lose access to third party licenses  shipments of our products could be delayed 
we believe that we will continue to rely  in part  on third party licenses to enhance and differentiate our products 
third party licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including undetected errors in the third party s software  disagreement over the scope of the license and other key terms  such as royalties payable  and infringement actions brought by third party licensees 
if we lose or are unable to maintain any of these third party licenses  it could delay the shipment or release of our products 
any delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain large enterprise customers 
we must retain and continue to expand our ability to reach and penetrate large enterprise customers by adding effective channel distributors and expanding our consulting services 
our inability to attract and retain large enterprise customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
large enterprise customers usually request special pricing and generally have longer sales cycles  which could negatively impact our revenues 
additionally  as we attempt to attract and penetrate large enterprise customers  we could need to increase corporate branding and marketing activities  which could increase our operating expenses 
these efforts may not proportionally increase our operating revenues and could reduce our profits 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to expand and diversify our distribution channels 
we intend to continue to expand our distribution channels by leveraging our relationships with independent hardware and software vendors and system integrators to encourage them to recommend or distribute our products 
in addition  an integral part of our strategy is to diversify our base of channel relationships by adding more channel members with abilities to reach larger enterprise customers 
this will require additional resources as we will need to expand our internal sales and service coverage of these customers 
if we fail in these efforts and cannot expand or diversify our distribution channels  our business could be adversely affected 
in addition to this diversification of our base  we will need to maintain a healthy mix of members who cater to smaller customers 
we could need to add and remove distribution members to maintain customer satisfaction and a steady adoption rate of our products  which could increase our operating expenses 
we are currently investing  and intend to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these channels  which could reduce our profits 

table of contents if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future  we may not be able to fund our operations and fulfill our future obligations 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our product development and offerings and make payments on our debt and other obligations depends on a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all  or that we will be able to liquidate our investments  sell assets or raise equity when needed or desirable 
in december  we invested million in a trust managed by an investment advisor in order to maintain sufficient liquidity in the event that our debentures are redeemed in march if the value of the investments in the trust significantly decreases  the proceeds of the trust combined with our other cash and investments may not be sufficient to fund the redemption of our outstanding debentures in  if required 
an inability to fund our operations or fulfill outstanding obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for further information  please refer to liquidity and capital resources 
we rely on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that we do not control 
we rely significantly on independent distributors and resellers to market and distribute our products 
we do not control our distributors and resellers 
additionally  our distributors and resellers are not obligated to buy our products and could also represent other lines of products 
some of our distributors and resellers maintain inventories of our packaged products for resale to our smaller end user customers 
if distributors and resellers reduce their inventory of our packaged products  our business could be adversely affected 
in the quarter ended december   we believe that our distributors and resellers held smaller inventories of packaged products as compared to inventories they held in prior quarters 
further  we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances with certain distributors 
for example  one of our distributors accounted for approximately of gross accounts receivable as of december  as of december   the same distributor accounted for of gross accounts receivable 
the financial condition of our distributors could deteriorate and distributors could significantly delay or default on their payment obligations 
any significant delays or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products could contain errors that could delay the release of new products and may not be detected until after our products are shipped 
despite significant testing by us and by current and potential customers  our products  especially new products or releases  could contain errors 
in some cases  these errors may not be discovered until after commercial shipments have been made 
errors in our products could delay the development or release of new products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
additionally  our products depend on third party products  which could contain defects and could reduce the performance of our products or render them useless 
because our products are often used in mission critical applications  errors in our products or the products of third parties upon which our products rely could give rise to warranty or other claims by our customers 
our research and development purchased in acquisitions is subject to certain risks 
in the past we have re evaluated the amounts charged to in process research and development in connection with acquisitions and licensing arrangements 
the amount and rate of amortization of those amounts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
the risks and uncertainties include the effects of any changes in accounting standards or guidance adopted by the sec or the accounting profession 
any changes in accounting standards or guidance adopted by the sec could materially adversely affect our future results of operations through increased amortization expense 
we cannot assure you that actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired in process research and development will match the projections we used to initially value in process research and development when we acquired it 
ongoing operations and 
table of contents financial results for acquired assets and licensed technology  and for our business as a whole  are subject to a variety of risks  which we may not have known or been able to estimate at the time of the transactions 
furthermore  we cannot guarantee that we will succeed in our efforts to integrate and further develop our acquired technologies 
in and  we acquired certain in process software technologies from viewsoft and sequoia 
we are currently working on integrating some of the acquired technologies into our anticipated future product offerings and on associated design  development and rework required to integrate the technologies 
however  we cannot guarantee we will be successful in our efforts to integrate and further develop these technologies 
if we fail to complete the development of our anticipated future product offerings  or if we fail to complete them in a timely manner  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we cannot currently determine the impact those delays could have on our business  future results of operations and financial condition 
we could incur additional charges in later periods to reflect costs associated with completing those projects 
acquisitions present many risks  and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate at the time of an acquisition 
acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky 
we cannot assure anyone that our previous acquisitions  including the purchase of sequoia  or any future acquisitions will be successful 
the risks we commonly encounter are difficulties integrating the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and an uncertain sales and earnings stream from the acquired company  which could unexpectedly dilute our earnings 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot guarantee that the combined company resulting from any acquisition can continue to support the growth achieved by the companies separately 
we must also focus on our ability to manage and integrate any acquisition 
our failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquired companies could adversely affect our business and operating results 
if we lose key personnel or cannot hire enough qualified employees  our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected 
our success depends  in large part  upon the services of a number of key employees 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
the effective management of our growth  if any  could depend upon our ability to retain our highly skilled technical  managerial  finance and marketing personnel 
if any of those employees leave  we will need to attract and retain replacements for them 
we could also need to add key personnel in the future 
the market for these qualified employees is competitive 
we could find it difficult to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
also  we could need to hire additional personnel to develop new products  product enhancements and technologies 
if we cannot add the necessary staff and resources  our ability to develop future enhancements and features to our existing or future products could be delayed 
any delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents if product returns or price adjustments exceed our reserves  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we provide most of our distributors with product return rights only for the purpose of stock balancing  which generally permit our distributors to return products to us  subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our products 
we also provide price protection rights to most of our distributors 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors if we lower our prices for those products within a specified time period 
to cover our exposure to these product returns and price adjustments  we establish reserves based on our evaluation of historical product trends and current marketing plans 
however  we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover our future product returns and price adjustments 
if we inadequately forecast reserves  our operating results could be adversely affected 
increased political and social turmoil could adversely impact our business 
increasing political and social turmoil  such as terrorist and military actions  can be expected to put further pressure on economic conditions in the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
these conditions make it difficult for us  and our customers  to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price could be volatile  and you could lose the value of your investment 
our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly to date 
the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
your investment in our stock could lose value 
some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results  analyst reports or recommendations  changes in interest rates  and other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the stock market in general  the nasdaq national market and the market for software companies and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market and industry factors could materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
if we fail to manage our operations and control expenses effectively  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
historically  the scope of our operations  the number of our employees and the geographic area of our operations have grown rapidly 
in addition  we have acquired both domestic and international companies 
this growth and the assimilation of acquired operations and their employees could continue to place a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
to manage our growth  if any  effectively  we need to continue to implement and improve additional management and financial systems and controls 
we may not be able to manage the current scope of our operations or future growth effectively and still exploit market opportunities for our products and services in a timely and cost effective way 
our future operating results could also depend on our ability to manage our expanding product line  our marketing and sales organizations  and our client support organization as installations of our products increase 

table of contents we took steps to reduce operating expenses commencing in the fourth quarter of  however our operating expenses in could exceed our operating expenses in an increase in operating expenses could reduce our income from operations and cash flows from operating activities in the future 
our business and investments could be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic conditions 
general economic and market conditions  and other factors outside our control  could adversely affect our business and impair the value of our investments 
any further downturn in general economic conditions could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our business 
in addition  an economic downturn could result in an impairment in the value of our investments requiring us to record losses related to such investments 
an impairment in the value of these investments may disrupt our ongoing business and distract management 
as of december   we had million of short and long term investments with various issuers and financial institutions 
in many cases we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these investments and could incur losses related to the impairment of these investments 
fluctuations in economic and market conditions could adversely effect the value of our investments  and we could lose some of our investment portfolio 
a total loss of an investment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
for further information on these investments  please refer to liquidity and capital resources 
our revenue may not grow  and if we do not successfully manage our expenses  our business could be negatively impacted 
we attribute most of our growth during recent years to the introduction of the metaframe software for windows operating systems in mid we cannot assure you that the infrastructure software markets in which we operate  will grow 
we cannot assure that the release of our secure access infrastructure software suite  including the metaframe secure access manager  or other new products will increase our revenue growth rate 
in addition  to the extent our revenue grows  if at all  we believe that our cost of revenues and certain operating expenses could also increase 
in the third quarter of  we took actions to reduce operating expenses starting in the fourth quarter of we cannot assure you that our operating expenses will be lower than our estimated or actual revenues in any given quarter 
if we experience a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter  we likely will not be able to further reduce operating expenses quickly in response 
any significant shortfall in revenue could immediately and adversely affect our results of operations for that quarter 
also  due to the fixed nature of many of our expenses and our current expectation for revenue growth  our income from operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities could be lower than in recent years 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events  gains or losses 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
the counter parties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results could differ materially 
discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
exposure to exchange rates a substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies  primarily british pounds sterling  euros  swiss francs  japanese yen and australian dollars 
to reduce exposure to reduction in us dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established a hedging program 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures 
our hedging program significantly reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
at december  and  we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively  and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
at december  and  these contracts had an aggregate fair value of million and million  respectively 
based on a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease by million 
conversely  a hypothetical depreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by million 
foreign operating costs in these hypothetical movements would move in the opposite direction 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above  changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in levels of local currency prices or sales reported in us dollars 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these forward foreign exchange contracts 
exposure to interest rates in order to better manage our exposure to interest rate risk  in december we entered into interest rate swap agreements 
the swap agreements  with an aggregate notional amount of million convert the fixed rate return on of our available for sale securities  to a floating rate 
the aggregate fair value of the interest rate swaps at december  was a liability of million 
based upon a hypothetical increase in the market interest rate as of december   the fair value of these aggregated liabilities would have decreased by approximately million 
based on a hypothetical decrease in the market interest rate as of december   the fair value of these aggregated liabilities would have increased by approximately million 
the underlying assets would experience offsetting gains and losses 
we also maintain available for sale and held to maturity investments in debt securities  which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged 
the securities classified as available for sale are subject to interest rate risk 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest  dividends and reinvestment income 
if 
table of contents market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis on our available for sale portfolio excludes the underlying investments to our interest rate swaps discussed above  as the interest rate risk related to those investments has been effectively hedged 
for more information see note to our consolidated financial statements 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our interest rate swap agreements and its available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios 
this analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
in april  we entered into a synthetic lease with a substantive lessor totaling approximately million related to office space utilized for our corporate headquarters 
payments under this synthetic lease are indexed to a variable interest rate libor plus a margin 
based upon our interest rate exposure under this synthetic lease at december   a basis point change in the current interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition to interest rate exposure  if the fair value of our headquarters building in fort lauderdale  florida were to significantly decline  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition
