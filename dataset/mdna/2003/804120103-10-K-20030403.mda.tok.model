item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when we refer to the fiscal year  we mean the fiscal year ended january   when we refer to the fiscal year  we mean the fiscal year ended january   when we refer to the fiscal year  we mean the fiscal year ended january  and all dollar amounts are in thousands  except per share amounts 
business overview our core business focus is to design  develop and market performance oriented athletic footwear and athletic apparel  which we sell under the saucony brand name  and athletic apparel  which we sell under the hind brand name 
sales of saucony brand products accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated net sales for  and  respectively  the significant majority of which are sales of saucony footwear products 
our results of operations  financial position and cash flows are heavily dependent upon our saucony footwear business 
our ability to increase saucony footwear sales is dependent upon increasing our share of the market for footwear sales 
we pursue different strategies for our two saucony footwear product categories 
for our technical footwear category  we combine high quality material and components and technical features designed to meet the performance requirements of athletes who have a high participation rate in their choice of sport 
we incorporate either our ground reaction inertia device  or grid system  or our proprietary footwear technology  custom ride management  into the majority of our technical footwear products 
for our originals footwear category  we design fashion oriented footwear intended to appeal to younger consumers who generally do not wear the footwear for athletic purposes 
our primary footwear focus is in technical footwear 
as a result  we direct most of our design and development efforts and working capital investments towards our saucony technical footwear 
we view our originals footwear as a market opportunity which we must carefully manage due to rapid shifts in consumer preferences 
accordingly  we limit our investment in working capital for  and our spending on design and development of  our originals footwear 
our saucony technical footwear and originals footwear  along with athletic apparel we sell under the saucony brand name  constitute one operating segment 
we have another operating segment which consists of athletic apparel we sell under the hind brand name  shoes for coaches and officials and casual leather walking and workplace footwear we sell under the spot bilt brand name and sales of all of our products at our factory outlet stores 
we refer to this segment as our other products segment 
sales from our other products segment accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated net sales for   and  respectively 
a majority of these sales are sales of our hind athletic apparel 
we compete in intensely competitive markets 
our ability to achieve sales growth is dependent upon several factors including  but not limited to  product design and technical performance  product quality  price  styling and our ability to market and promote our brand and our products 
our business is sensitive to consumer spending patterns  which in turn are subject to prevailing regional and national economic patterns  such as employment levels and consumer confidence 
continued increases in national unemployment levels and decreased consumer confidence may restrict consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting our sales and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
our most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when title passes and all the rewards and risk of loss have been transferred and all the criteria for revenue recognition described in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b are met 
title generally passes upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we must make estimates for defective product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue 
we record a provision for defective product returns and other allowances based upon past experience and the receipt of notification of pending returns 
while the returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  the product return rate may not remain constant 
any significant increase in the product return rate and resulting reduction in our net sales could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows for the period in which the returns materialize 
if actual or expected future returns and allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we established  we would record a reduction or increase to our reserves in the period in which such determination was made 
accounts receivable allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and therefore must estimate losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze our accounts receivable  historical bad debt trends  customer credit worthiness  economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as noted in note of the consolidated financial statements  we have a credit risk concentration  due to the concentration of our domestic saucony footwear sales among a relatively small customer base 
if the liquidity or financial condition of any of our larger customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments due us or if payment schedules of our customers are otherwise delayed from historical trends  additional allowances might be required  which could materially increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and effect our results of operations and cash flows 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or the current estimated market value 
we calculate the provision for excess and obsolete inventory as the difference between the cost of the inventory and our estimated market value of the inventory 
we estimate market value based upon estimated product demand and market conditions 
the provision is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional provisions to write down inventory may be required  which could materially reduce our amount of current assets and affect our results of operations and cash flows 
property  plant and equipment we record property  plant and equipment  including buildings  leasehold improvements  equipment and computer equipment at cost and depreciate it over the applicable estimated useful life 
changes in circumstances  such as technological advances or changes to our business operations  can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be decreased  we would increase depreciation over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset s net book value to its salvage value 
decreasing an assets estimated useful life could affect our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets we review the recoverability of our long lived assets property  plant and equipment and trademarks when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment of a long lived asset if the carrying value of the long lived asset is not recoverable from its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
we measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its estimated fair value 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of to reduce the carrying amount of long lived assets used in our retail operations  which carrying value we deemed to be not recoverable from its undiscounted future cash flows 
the charge is included in general and administrative expenses 
should future events and circumstance cause cash flows associated with any of our long lived assets to decline significantly from our estimates  we may need to record charges for impairment of long lived assets  which would affect our results of operations and financial position 
we no longer amortize goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
rather  we review them for impairment 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value 
we record impairment charges as a component of general and administrative expenses 
we test the impairment of our goodwill annually 
we completed an annual test for impairment at january  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
at january   the carrying value of goodwill was our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows may differ materially from actual cash flows due to  technological changes  economic conditions or changes to our business operations 
a charge for impairment of goodwill may be necessary if we experience a significant decline in our undiscounted future cash flows 
such a charge would affect our results of operations and financial position 
income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions that we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences  which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish valuation allowances when we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets resulting from operating losses will not be realized 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
during fiscal  we recorded deferred tax valuation allowances of on loss carryforwards that are not expected to be realized  increasing our tax expense in the period such determination was made 
at january   we have provided valuation allowances in an amount equal to our deferred tax assets which have resulted from net operating losses 
us generally accepted accounting principles allow companies to defer the recognition of tax liability on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in the foreign operation 
at january   we had approximately  of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations for which we have not recorded deferred income taxes 
were we to repatriate foreign earnings which have been designated as indefinitely invested in foreign operations  we would record additional tax expense at the time of repatriation 
stock based compensation we have elected to continue to measure stock based compensation expense using the intrinsic value method 
accordingly  we measure compensation cost for stock options and restricted stock awards as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the exercise price an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we calculate compensation cost for stock purchase warrants based upon the fair value at the grant date 
we amortize stock based compensation arising from the issuance of restricted stock warrants  below market options and stock based compensation resulting from stock purchase warrants over the vesting period of the stock grant  option term or the warrant term 
amortization of stock based compensation amounted to  and for  and  respectively 
had we determined the stock based compensation expense for our stock options based upon the fair value at the grant date for stock option awards in fiscal  and  our reported net income would have been reduced by  and  respectively 
hedge accounting for derivatives we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions  as well as the resulting intercompany liabilities which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
these contracts economically function as effective hedges of the underlying exposures  however  we are required to record changes in the fair value of these foreign currency contracts against earnings in the period of the change 
we estimate the fair value of our foreign currency exchange contracts based on foreign exchange rates as of january  at january   the notional value our foreign currency exchange contracts to purchase us dollars was  the fair value of our foreign currency exchange contracts at january  was  we recorded a charge of against earnings to adjust our derivatives to their fair value 
since january   the value of the us dollar has decreased against the canadian dollar and the euro 
continued weakness of the us dollar will require that we record additional charges in fiscal to adjust our derivatives to their fair value 
the amount of the potential charge is dependent upon the change in foreign exchange rates from the january  rates to the time that the forward exchange contract matures or to the foreign exchange rates as of the period end reporting date 
these charges could have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
contingencies we are involved in legal proceedings involving employee and contractual relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights and other matters 
we record contingent liabilities for claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the claim will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of several factors and may include our judgment as to the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our earnings or on our financial position 
if actual or estimated probable future claims exceed our recorded liability for the claims  we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred

the volume of domestic footwear sold in fiscal decreased to  pair from  pair in fiscal the higher average wholesale selling price per pair was due to increased unit volume of first quality technical footwear and lower unit volumes of closeout footwear and originals footwear  both of which sell at prices below our first quality technical footwear 
sales of closeout footwear accounted for approximately of domestic saucony net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in closeout footwear sales is due to lower inventory quantities of past season footwear available for sale in fiscal originals footwear accounted for of fiscal domestic footwear unit volume versus in fiscal the unit volume decrease in originals footwear is primarily due to a shift in consumer preference to other product categories  primarily basketball footwear  which we do not sell 
our domestic order cancellation rate for fiscal was comparable with our historical averages

the lower average wholesale selling price per pair is due to higher unit volumes of closeout footwear and special make up footwear  both of which sell at prices below our first quality technical footwear 
sales of closeout footwear accounted for approximately of domestic saucony net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the originals footwear accounted for of fiscal domestic footwear unit volume versus in fiscal the unit volume decrease in originals footwear is primarily due to a shift in consumer preference to other product categories  primarily basketball footwear  which we do not sell 
during the second half of fiscal  the domestic order cancellation rate for our saucony footwear decreased from the order cancellation rate in the first half of fiscal and was comparable with our historical average 
international net sales increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due primarily to a increase in footwear unit volumes  partially offset by a lower average per pair wholesale selling price and the negative impact of the stronger us dollar against european currencies 
footwear unit volumes increased at our international distributor business and at our european and canadian subsidiaries  respectively  in fiscal versus fiscal the footwear unit volume increase in our international distributor business was due primarily to the success of our originals footwear product in the japanese footwear market in  which accounted for approximately of the international distributor unit volume increase  and increased market penetration in the pacific rim

costs and expenses our gross margin in fiscal increased to from in fiscal due primarily to increased saucony domestic sales of first quality footwear products at full margin 
other factors contributing to the fiscal margin increase were proportionately lower sales of closeout footwear products  reduced cost resulting from the closing of our bangor  maine manufacturing operations  improved margins on several domestic footwear products and higher levels of domestic at once shipments  which shipments carry lower discounts  partially offset by increased inventory provisions for obsolete hind raw material and for some slow moving hind apparel finished goods 
our gross margin in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal due primarily to the significant decline in saucony domestic sales of first quality footwear products at full margin 
other factors contributing to the fiscal margin decrease were proportionately higher sales of closeout products  due to our decision to reduce inventory levels and of special make up footwear  both of which carry lower margins  and to a lesser extent manufacturing inefficiencies  domestic pricing pressures  changes in the geographic mix of sales and the negative impact of the us dollar on our european margins

we anticipate capital expenditures to range between  to  in fiscal of this amount  we expect approximately to  will be spent on computer hardware and software and approximately to will be spent to open three retail stores 
contractual obligations below is a table which presents our contractual obligations and commitments at january  payments due by year contractual and obligations total thereafter long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases  other long term obligations   total contractual obligations    other long term obligations include athlete and event sponsorship and employment contracts with two key executives 
the amounts included for athlete sponsorship represent base compensation 
actual payments may be higher than the amounts included as these contracts provide for bonus payments to the athletes based upon athletic achievements in future periods 
overall liquidity our liquidity is contingent upon a number of factors  principally our future operating results 
management believes that our current cash and cash equivalents  credit facilities and internally generated funds are adequate to meet our working capital requirements and other operating expenses and to fund our capital investment needs and debt service payments in the near term 
during fiscal we generated  in cash from operating cash flows due to our operating profit and an increase in our accrued liabilities and accounts payable 
in  we generated  in cash from operating cash flows  due primarily to decreases in our accounts receivable and inventories 
as of january   we had  in accounts receivable and  in inventories 
at january   we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities 
our short term liquidity could potentially be adversely impacted should demand for our products decline significantly  which could result in extended payment terms for our customers and the increased use of price concessions to induce customers to purchase our products 
inflation and currency risk the effect of inflation on our results of operations over the past three years has been minimal 
the impact of currency fluctuation on our purchase of inventory from foreign suppliers has been minimal as the transactions were denominated in us dollars 
we are  however  subject to currency fluctuation risk with respect to the operating results of our foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency denominated payables 
during fiscal the gross margins of our european subsidiaries were reduced due to currency fluctuation 
we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to minimize various transaction currency risks 
we believe that our forward foreign currency contracts function as economic hedges of our cash flows and that our foreign exchange management program effectively minimizes various transaction currency risks 
accounting pronouncements sfas in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  sfas  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  apb  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in apb sfas also amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  arb to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
the provisions of sfas are to be applied to all long lived assets  with the exception of goodwill 
sfas retains the requirements of sfas to recognize an impairment loss only if the carry amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
sfas expands upon the criteria beyond that previously specified in sfas to determine when a long lived asset is held for sale and provides guidance on the accounting for long lived assets classified as held for sale if the asset is being reclassified as held and used 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the statement retains the basic provisions of apb for the presentation of discontinued operations in the statement of operations but broadens the definition of a discontinued operations to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
the company adopted sfas in the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge of to reduce the carrying amount of certain long lived assets used in the company s retail operations  which carrying value was not deemed recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
sfas in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure amendment of sfas  sfas 
sfas amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements for sfas  to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we have elected to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options and restricted stock awards is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the exercise price an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we have adopted the annual disclosure provisions of sfas in our financial statements for the year ended january  and will adopt the interim disclosure provisions in our financial statements for the quarter ended april  since the adoption of sfas involves disclosure only  we do not expect a material impact on our earnings or on our financial position 
special note regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
in some cases you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will  and would  or similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations  contain projections of future results of operations or of financial position or state other forward looking information 
the important factors listed below  as well as any cautionary language elsewhere in this annual report on form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in these forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in the risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
any forward looking statements in this annual report on form k are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results  developments and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such forward looking statements  possibly materially 
we disclaim any duty to update any forward looking statements 
certain other factors that may affect future results we face intense competition competition is intense in the markets in which we sell our products 
we compete with a large number of other companies  both domestic and foreign  several of which are large organizations with diversified product lines  well known brands and financial  distribution and marketing resources substantially greater than ours 
the principal competitors for our saucony products are nike  new balance and asics 
the principal competitors of our hind products are nike  pearl izumi and sugoi 
we compete based on a variety of factors  including price  product style  durability and quality  product design and technical performance  brand image and awareness  marketing and promotion and the ability to meet delivery commitments to retailers 
a technological breakthrough or marketing or promotional success by one of our competitors could adversely affect our competitive position 
the intensity of the competition that we face constitutes a significant risk to our business 
we depend on foreign suppliers a number of manufacturers located in asia  primarily in china  supply products to us 
during fiscal  one of our suppliers  located in china  accounted for approximately of our total footwear purchases by dollar volume 
we are subject to the usual risks of a business involving foreign suppliers  such as currency fluctuations  government regulation of fund transfers  export and import duties  administrative trade cases  trade limitations imposed by the united states or foreign governments and political and labor instability 
there are a number of trade related and other issues creating significant friction between the governments of the united states and china  and the imposition of punitive import duties on certain categories of chinese products has been threatened in the past and may be implemented in the future 
in addition  we have no long term manufacturing agreements with our foreign suppliers and compete with other athletic shoe and apparel companies  including companies that are much larger than us  for access to production facilities 
we need to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and merchandise trends the footwear and apparel industries are subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences 
demand for our products  particularly our originals line has been and may continue to be affected adversely by changing fashion trends and consumer style preferences 
we believe that our success depends in substantial part on our ability to anticipate  gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner 
in addition  our decisions concerning new product designs often need to be made several months before we can determine consumer acceptance 
as a result  our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in styles or features could lead to problems such as excess inventories and higher markdowns  lower gross margins due to the necessity of providing discounts to retailers and the inability to sell such products through our own factory outlet stores 
our quarterly results may fluctuate our revenues and quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including o the timing and shipment of individual orders  o market acceptance of footwear and other products offered by us  o changes in our operating expenses  o personnel changes  o mix of products sold  o changes in product pricing  o general economic conditions  and  o weather 
in addition  a substantial portion of our revenue is realized during the last few weeks of each quarter 
as a result  any delays in orders or shipments are more likely to result in revenue not being recognized until the following quarter  which could adversely impact our results of operations for a particular quarter 
our current expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future revenue 
as a result  net income for a given period could be disproportionately affected by any reduction in revenue 
it is possible that in some future quarter our revenue or operating results will be below the expectations of stock market securities analysts and investors 
if that were to occur  the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
our revenues are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations we conduct operations in various international countries  and a portion of our sales is transacted in local currencies 
as a result  our revenues are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
from time to time  our financial results have been adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to protect us from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
however  our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful  and currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition 
our business is affected by seasonal consumer buying patterns the athletic and casual footwear and athletic apparel industries in which we compete are generally characterized by significant seasonality of sales and results of operations 
sales of our saucony brand and hind brand products have historically been seasonal in nature  with the strongest sales generally occurring in the first and third quarters 
we believe that sales of our products will continue to follow this seasonal cycle 
therefore  our results of operations for any one quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
our operating results may be affected by order cancellations customers may cancel orders of our products at any time without financial penalty 
as a result  our backlog does not necessarily represent actual future shipments 
the rate of customer cancellations can vary quarter to quarter and year to year 
if the retail market continues to be weak or weakens again in the future  our customers could cancel further orders of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we are susceptible to financial difficulties of retailers we sell our products primarily to major retailers  some of whom have experienced financial difficulties  including bankruptcy 
we cannot predict what effect the future financial condition of such retailers will have on our business 
in particular  we cannot guarantee that our bad debt expenses will not be material in future periods 
we need effective marketing and advertising programs because consumer demand for our products is heavily influenced by brand image  our business requires substantial investments in marketing and advertising 
failure of such investments to achieve the desired effect in terms of increased retailer acceptance or consumer purchase of our products could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  we believe that our success depends in part upon our ability to periodically launch new marketing and advertising programs 
if we are unable to successfully design or execute new marketing and advertising  or if such programs are ineffective  we may not be able to increase or maintain our sales and our brand image 
we depend on certain key customers approximately of our gross trade receivables balance was represented by customers at january  we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period will depend to a significant extent upon sales to major customers 
the loss of or a reduction in the level of sales to one or more major customers or the failure of a major customer to proceed with a large order or to timely pay us for a large order could materially reduce our sales 
we depend on the strength of our intellectual property protection of our products we use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks is an important factor in marketing our products 
we have registered our marks in the united states and in a number of foreign countries 
we may not be able to register or use our marks in each foreign country in which we seek to register them 
moreover  the registrations we seek and secure may be inadequate 
we may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our trademarks 
changes in general economic conditions may adversely affect our business our business is sensitive to consumers spending patterns  which in turn are subject to prevailing regional and national economic conditions  such as interest and taxation rates  employment levels and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these economic factors may restrict consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting our growth and profitability 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial position 
our objective in managing our exposure to interest rates and foreign currency rate changes is to limit the impact of these changes on cash flows and earnings and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
in order to achieve these objectives we identify the risks and manage them by adjusting fixed and variable rate debt positions and selectively hedging foreign currency risks 
borrowings under our credit facilities are based on floating rates  which would increase interest expense in an environment of rising interest rates 
we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge firm and anticipated purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries  local currencies 
the purpose of our currency hedging activities is to protect our local subsidiaries cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
our forward exchange contracts principally hedge us denominated transactions with our canadian  dutch and british subsidiaries 
while we have a policy of selectively hedging foreign currency risks  but there are no assurances that this program will fully insulate us against short term fluctuations in financial results 
currency risk the fair value of our forward exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
the fair value of forward exchange contracts is the estimated amount that we would pay or receive upon termination of the contract  taking into account the change in the currency exchange rates 
as of january   the fair value of our forward exchange contracts was  we have calculated the effect of a depreciation in the year end currency exchange rates related to the forward exchange contracts 
this depreciation would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward exchange contracts of  which would affect our fiscal results of operations and financial position 
the unrealized losses on our forward exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates will be partially offset by gains on the exposures being hedged 
we have also calculated the effect of a depreciation in year end interest rates and have determined the effects to our results of operations and financial position to be immaterial 
we do not expect to make any significant changes in our management of foreign currency or interest rate exposures or in the strategies we employ to manage such exposures in the foreseeable future
